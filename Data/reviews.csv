129.Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles II,[u'DELICIOUS NOODLES! Rating:Time Wait 5/5: Walked in found a seat the waitress took our order got our food in 5 minutes or less. Quality 5/5: Noodles were bomb delicious dumplings tasted and smelled fresh. Price 4.5/5: Reasonable price. Although plates and servings were small perfect for my family of four. DELICIOUS!' u'I went here because of Guy Fieri. I know kind of embarrassing but on a blazing hot day in New York when my boyfriend and I were both ravenously hungry Guy\'s voice seemed to lure us from down the block. And boy were we satisfied. The waitress was incredibly attentive. The food came out quickly and was hot and delicious. There was a huge bounty of free condiments including my personal favorites chili oil Sriracha and Chinese Black Vinegar. The waitress even gave us some Asian candy to eat when she arrived with our bill. Most importantly though there was seemingly endless flow of water to save us from both the heat outside (It was nearly 95 degrees out on the sidewalk.) and inside. (I doused our lunch in chili oil.) The only downside is that the restaurant is extremely small. It had difficulty accommodating a family of four let alone a large group of maybe eight or ten. But don\'t let that deter you! In the words of my boyfriend just after we finished our meal "Should we order another plate? Because I could defiently eat another plate."' u"Summary: \xa0Very small. Try to be just 2 people or 4 at the most. \xa0Duck noodle soup still the best. \xa0Not as good as the one downtown.Atmosphere: \xa0Tiny hole in the wall spot that has captured Chinatown for Hell's Kitchen. \xa0It is mostly Asian people too lazy to go down to Chinatown for a Noodle fix. \xa0Nearly everyone Asian White Black Mulatto Latino or whatever somehow speaks Mandarin in here. \xa0The Service: The waitress was great when I was there. \xa0Tries to sort you out quickly. \xa0Typically tries to speak with you in Mandarin first if you look anywhere in the range of being able to speak her language. \xa0The Food: \xa0It's great and if it I didn't know THPN I I would be tempted at the 5th star. \xa0They lost me on their dry noodles but willing to give them another try.Duck Soup Noodles - 4 stars Great Chinese Style Hand-pulled noodle. \xa0They use the same great noodles as downtown. \xa0The duck - while a tiny boney duck that makes me laugh a little given the fat ducks I see in Florida- was flavorfully cooked. \xa0I wish they had heftier ducks is all. \xa0I would get this and still recommend it is the best of the noodle soups to someone trying this place out with with the normal noodles.Chicken Noodles - Eh... not as good as downtown. I think it is the mix of veggies which seemed more like a mix of onions to me. \xa0Just didn't do it for me. \xa03 stars.Comments: \xa0I'd like to see a broader variety of hot sauce options but I didn't dock you for that because you had Chinese Black Vinegar which even Mee's down the street doesn't carry regularly enough for me. \xa0You're still way better than Mee's Noodle and you save me the trip to Chinatown so rounding you up." u"For my girlfriend and I this is the go-to spot for a quick cheap and delicious dinner on a typical weekday. The place is usually not too crowded with seating immediately available for a party of two. The restaurant has an authentic vibe to it having the decor of a street-side restaurant in China and is kept fairly clean.The service is attentive. When you enter the restaurant the person at the cashier greets you immediately and gets you seated. They do a good job explaining how their menu works. Throughout the meal they proactively refill water and ask how the meal is going.In terms of the food I have had a variety of dishes here - combinations of various soup bases paired with seven different noodle cuts. Not a single dish/combination disappointed so far. My go-to choices are the beef hand pulled noodle soup with noodle #3 and the pork dumplings. Wholesome and delicious! If you like spicy their chili sauce has a nice kick to it to add even more flavor to your dish.Overall my girlfriend and I love this restaurant. I grew up in China and the food from here reminds me of home. Highly recommended to anyone looking for authentic Chinese cuisine in Hell's Kitchen!" u'Pretty pretty good. I still like the one on doyers more but this is not bad for midtown. The broth is rich the noodles are chewy and thick the meat is plentiful. Get dat beef yes.' u'I got the roasted pork Hand-Pulled noodles#2 and fried dumplings as my appetizer. Overall absolutely satisfying! Would definitely come back when I want some noodles in NYC.' u'For the price you get a great bang for your buck in this little gem in Hell\'s Kitchen. The portions are huuuuuge so make sure to have built up and appetite. Food? So their "noodle soup" options are a lot like pho. I couldn\'t figure out what Asian cuisine this was but I\'m leaning towards Vietnamese. I was a little disappointed with the lack of chicken in the chicken noodle soup. Lots of noodle. Lots of soup. Almost zero chicken. Prices? Awesome. For $9 you\'ll leave full and satisfied. Ambience? It\'s okey. Not really much going on but ya pay for what ya get. Will I return? Probably. But only if I\'m in the area. I vote for obao across the street.' u"On a mission to find the best beef noodle soup in NYC I ordered the beef stew noodle soup for lunch today. It was pretty good. At first glance the beef stew noodle bowl had few chunks of meat but when I got to the bottom of the bowl there were a lot more so I was pretty content with my lunch. Didn't see any spicy noodle options on the menu which was disappointing (I must have missed it if there ARE spicy options) but there is hot chili oil and sriracha sauce on the tables. I doused my noodles with a hefty spoonfull of oil and hot sauce throughout my meal. Utensils cups napkins and water are self serve which I like because I never have to wait for the waitress to refill my water. There is a $15 credit card minimum and I would suggest not to come here with large parties of more than 4 it'll be super cramped and difficult to find a seat for the entire party." u"This is a hole in the wall hand pulled noodle shop in Hell's Kitchen that is so small you might not even get a table. When we arrived it kind of smelled like BO in there but we realized soon after it was a few of the patrons. Not appetizing but luckily they left before our food came.It's definitely no frills as they will give you cheap stuff to eat off of but you know what? If it's good food it doesn't even matter. The cucumber salad was pretty good as an appetizer and then we got a typical Chinese beef stew. I thought the noodles were nice but the soup was average. My girlfriend (who's from China) and I have had better elsewhere. Not a bad option and cheap." u"Came here for take out during lunch time. The place got pretty crammed while I was waiting so it took a little longer to get my food. Because of the longer wait the lady offered me a free drink.I got the pan fried knife peeled noodles with duck and the portion was pretty big. They were very generous with the amount of duck and gave me a full leg. Although the meat was slightly dry the skin was very juicy. The noodles weren't as chewy as expected but perhaps it was because I didn't eat it immediately.Overall this isn't a bad place grab some noodles for a satisfying meal." u"NEW MIDTOWN LOCATION A BLOCK AWAY FROM MY APARTMENT WHAT?I was so glad to hear about this opening right next to my apartment... This place is quite small three six person seating (very close to each other) and three two person table.Service: v quick it's a small place so they're pretty attentive. They use Styrofoam cups for water which i felt iffy about (bad for your health environment all around) but whatever... Upside is that they take credit cards and there's no minimum. (...... Spoke too soon.. They implemented a credit card minimum of $15 :/ )Food: Got the beef stew noodles with knife peeled. It was really good.. hot beef broth and chewy noodles. I did think the meat/veggie portion was a bit small compared to the Chinatown location. The meat was half actual meat and half tendon/omosa-ish stuff.I'm excited to try other things on the menu here even if I'm paying $4~5 more for the location/cleanness. I hope they maintain their hygeine status." u"So Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles part deux has made it's way all the up from Chinatown to Hell's Kitchen. They do the noodle thing and they do it well. \xa0The place pretty much defines hole in the wall. If I took a sledge hammer to a brick wall I would probably have come up with the same result. There are 3 tables of 2 and 3 tables of 6 but plenty of good eats to go around.It's a simple place with a simple recipe for the menu: 1. Pick your soup/dish2. Pick your noodlesI got the stir fry duck with knife cut noodles. The flavor was solid and not too satly and after digging through the mounds of noodles I actually found some duck. What a nice surprise duck in my duck stir fry happy day.The beef noodle soup was a better dish. The broth was solid the vegetables crisp and the noodles were of course tasty. Again the issue is the lack of protein.Either way you'll come away with a full belly and maybe next time you'll come back for more. The service was friendly and the food came out quickly. As Arnold would say I'll be back." u"Just like the one in Chinatown only a bit more modern and cleaner feeling with higher prices to match. \xa0At least you don't have to spend roundtrip subway fare to get there right?I'm glad these Chinese businesses are getting the courage to pop up inside of non Chinese hoods. \xa0As the success of Xian's famous foods has shown foodies are craving authentic real food instead of the typical American Chinese food. We had the knife peeled noodles cucumber salad stir fry bok choy and everything was tasty." u"It has finally happened - Chinatown in Hell's Kitchen!! I finally don't have to travel 40 minutes to get my authentic Chinese beef noodle soup fix.I got takeout from here (not delivery - so cannot speak to that) and was pretty happy with the results. We got the fish ball+pork wonton and beef stew noodle soup. The beef stew had a much heartier broth so that was the clear winner. Noodles were provided in a separate container to prevent noodle sogginess. They gave a bunch of veggies (mainly bok choy) but there definitely could've been more beef. But for the flavor and quantity/quality of noodles I was very very satisfied.Prices are probably ~$3-4 more than their Chinatown location but for some this is well worth the inconvenience of the subway ride. Plus the space here is nicer and you don't have to get pushed around by old Chinese grandmas while stepping in sewage water trying to find Doyer St.Just FYI my mom (authentic Chinese tiger mom) also gave a thumbs up for this place. The flavor of the broth and the texture of the noodles are both on point. For the most optimal noodle eating experience make sure to dine in as the noodles tend to stick together when separated from the soup.For Hell's Kitchen prices are very VERY reasonable and this is a GREAT find. Highly recommended for a quick and casual meal." u"Service was quick though not the friendliest. We ordered takeaway and requested 2 of the hot oils and the cashier only gave us 1...Per the Yelp reviews we tried the beef stew with knife peeled noodles which was delicious! The broth itself was great.They serve the noodles separately so they stay firm which I appreciate.The spring rolls were the only disappointment... $5.95 for 4 little rolls that didn't taste homemade. Not too surprised since they don't specialize in them but still sad!Would return for a nice soup on a cold day :)" u"Definitely one of the more tasty beef noodle soups I've had in New York! I loved the deeply flavored chunks of braised beef brisket and the very savory broth. In fact it was so savory that I had trouble drinking it all after I finished the noodles. I've tried both the standard thin hand pulled noodles and knife cut noodles both of which have a very nice chewy texture. I'd highly recommend eating this on rainy day!" u"SO GOOD. I have no idea why this place doesn't have a line out the door at all hours I would definitely wait for it. It's usually not too crowded if busy at all. Definitely my favorite go-to place when I know I want something delicious and it never lets me down. Small place not fancy but the food is amazing." u"This is like eating street food in China. It's not super delicious it's not amazing but it's comforting. Vegetarian options are few but clearly marked on the menu. It's a small space not fancy at all but that matches what you'd expect of the food." u'We got delivery ramen and cucumber salad. The salad was small & expensive and basically a cucumber broken up. The ramen soups tasted like canned beef stock boiled with star anise. A sad and greasy fried egg lay crushed on top when I opened the house special ramen which also contained about two leaves of spinach grisly chicken flavorless grey strips of of what might have been short rib and over cooked shrimp.We ordered one soup with the noodles in and one with noodles on the side but both with disappointingly overcooked to the point of mush.Skip it.' u'Great food and great value! One of the few places with really good veggie stock. I ordered the veggie with egg noodle soup with knife pulled noodles (#5 noodle). The noodles are amazing though I would recommend going for one of the more traditional noodles (#1 or #2) next time. Also I love that they serve jasmine tea!Warning - very limited seating inside!']
175.Bistecca Fiorentina,[u"The service was excellent and the food was good. \xa0I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had but was good enough for the last minute search before \xa0a show. \xa0I will say the mussels were excellent and location was great!" u'I was brought here on valentines day and the Italian food was "OKAY" quality. The food was not bad but it was not something special that would entice me to go back. I ordered the antipasti as an appetizer and the meats were a bit dry. I felt as if it could of been much better. The Cabernet Sauvignon was good wine but yet again nothing special. The filet mignon was cooked to a perfect medium the only down side it was a bit dry so you really needed to put the steak sauce which wasn\'t that great to make it juicy.The pasta was really good. Both the gnocchi and spaghetti were cooked perfectly I really enjoyed it. Not the best Gnocchi I\'ve ever had but definitely made in house and soft. They accommodated what I requested and the staff was very nice. Anything I needed they brought it. They were constantly filling my cup with water and making sure I didn\'t need anything else.The desert was a standard tartufo. The thing that really stood out was this strawberry raspberry sauce they brought out with it that tastes so amazing. They do have a huge selection of deserts from tiramisu pudding to cake. All in all it was a good meal its a bit pricey so I hold the food to higher expectations which it didn\'t deliver sadly. Would probably not return there are a lot more romantic cute places in NYC. On top of it all the restaurant was really cold I would assume its because its a summer place. They have outside seating as well as glass doors all in the front. I ate valentines dinner in a north face fleece.' u"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner prior to a show. \xa0Made reservations prior and they seated me and my fianc\xe9 quickly. \xa0 The wait staff was nice enough to allow us to sit in a corner of the restaurant that was less crowded. \xa0Great service abs friendly too. The waiter was nice to give his recommendations. We ordered their Clams Oreganata oysters on the half shell and the squid special (don't recall the name of the dish) as appetizers. The clams were baked and seasons well. Very herby and the clam meat was still moist inside. The oysters were a good size and they had some really good sauces to accompany the oyster. The squid special was nice and had big tentacles and little octopus cooked together. For the main we ordered the seafood pasta special and the filet mignon with foie gras. The filet mignon was so buttery tender and the foie gras gave it another level of richness to the dish. I can't image it's good for you but it tastes so good I would have another. The seafood pasta was a large plate and had an abundance of seafood on it. The pasta itself tasted superb and balanced well into the tomatoey briny sauce. Overall a great dinner venue when you're in town for a show." u"Beautiful restaurant. Lovely service and welcoming atmosphere! It's nicely tucked away so you feel like you can escape the noise but still be outside on a wonderful patio. The food was delicious I had a 10oz fillet steak and immediately was impressed with the presentation and the perfection of the medium rare. Only thing I wish is that they would heat up their butter for their break a little or have whipped butter it tore up their wonderful loaf and I would have appreciated a better spread. Other than that really wonderful!I also noticed they have a show menu that seems to give you a really great meal in a short amount of time so you can make it to the theatre in time bravo!" u'My fiance and I had a romantic dinner here and the food was just perfect. Very elegant ambiance as well. Everything tasted fresh and delicious and the staff was super friendly. A lovely night for us!' u"Had been past this spot many times but this was the first visit. \xa0It was a quiet night and the service was quick and attentive. The salads were super fresh and the dressing was the right amount of vinaigrette to accompany the ingredients. \xa0The entrees were steaks to share and they didn't disappoint. Not steakhouse standard but good. Will come back.." u"A solid Italian steakhouse around the theater district. \xa0Bistecca Fiorentina doesn't try to beat the likes of Lugers in terms of quality but it's good for the sub-$40 price point it occupies. \xa0Ordered the rib eye and the porterhouse. \xa0Both were charred nicely and cooked to order. \xa0In my opinion the rib eye is the better choice. \xa0As I've said the restaurant isn't on par with the best of NYC's steakhouses (it doesn't try to) and consequently the strip side of the porterhouse just wasn't very impressive. \xa0While the tenderloin portion was good it's less than half of the porterhouse." u"Very just 'ok' not anything great. \xa0Way too overpriced for the quality of the food and the room. I would not go out of my way to go here. Actually I probably wouldn't return even if I lived on the block.Service was good - attentive but not annoying. We went pre-theater so were time conscious but not in a rush and they handled that well.The food quality was mediocre. In NYC you can't go 20 feet without tripping over a good Italian restaurant. This isn't one of them. My veal was very fatty and a little bland. My wife's dish felt very Olive Garden'y. \xa0The kicker is that it is way way too expensive for the quality of meal. \xa0Even the deserts were barely average.My general advice is go somewhere else. Unless you're from the 'burbs and mediocre Italian is your thing - then go for it." u'We came here for the pre-theater menu which is on until 7 at night to try out this cute restaurant at the side of the too busy Times Square. The place was PACKED this Saturday night but we were promptly seated by the kind waitress offered a menu a loaf of bread (yeah a loaf) with butter. The staff was very very efficient super fast and coordinated. We were in the middle next to the kitchen and they kept swinging in and out of the kitchen a little annoying to be so exposed but you can tell the place was buzzing and the staff was on it. Appetizers were the classic tomato and mozzarella: fresh and easy and the cured beef with parmesan and salad delicious! Main course were beef medallions and trout I enjoyed both very much I thought it was copious a little too much drench in sauce and there were no sides. I was a little stunned by that no side at all no veggies no nothing just your protein and the sauce on top.... For $28+ and $32+ you really should be offered a little something... Deserts were cheese cake and chocolate cake these two were actually pretty good like bakery good not sure if made in the house or bought from an outside bakery but very decent (totally cleaned the plates)! Overall great staff on top of service very buzzing nice prix-fixe no sides with your main course good experience.' u"Another nostalgic spot for my husband and I and we keep coming back each time we are in New York. This time we had the pleasure of being waited on by Claudio for a late evening dinner on our last night in the city and are still smiling remembering this delicious meal.I have had a few different entrees here before but really there is no other option than to enjoy the Ribeye or the Porterhouse. My husband and I enjoyed a delicious wine the Porterhouse for two and a couple of sides and it was perfect. Our daughter had a basic dish of pasta with butter and garlic and they were so incredibly sweet to her....which was so nice because our clocks were all off because of travel so it was quite late in the evening. We followed the meal with their custard dessert which was simple but delicious. Its a sweet cozy place with excellent service and a really nice steak. We have always ended up here later in the evening (after 9pm) and it has never been crowded so it is a nice way to escape the craziness happening a few blocks over. \xa0Also incredibly affordable...a steak dinner including a $100 bottle of wine was still under $250.Love. Can't wait to go back next time." u"A cozy welcoming Italian restaurant located in the heart of NY's Theater District - FANTASTIC food no gimmicks or attitude and the warmest staff you'll find in NY. We always make Bistecca a stop during all our trips - and it never disappoints :)" u"I am in love with this restaurant! Cute interior amazing service superb food very reasonably priced and in the theater district so you can grab a bite before a show.I came here at around 11:15pm since I had gotten off work super late and needless to say I was starving since I hadn't eaten for close to 12 hours.The host told me they were planning to close the kitchen but would make an exception for me (italians are so charming hehe) and keep the kitchen open for my order. I was debating whether to get a smaller steak (like the ribeye) or go for the 32 oz porterhouse. The waiter convinced me to get the porterhouse because it is a better cut of meat and comes with a small side of creamed spinach and if needed I could take the rest home. Umm yeah.. no packing food home for me. I devoured every last morsel of meat on that porterhouse. Practically inhaled it... it was DAMN good. They brought it out pre cut in a sizzling platter and the waiter served some of it onto a dinner plate with creamed spinach. It came with an amazing tasting cream sauce that i poured over the meat. The perfect piece of tender and juicy medium rare steak paired with the light cream sauce was heavenly. In fact my mouth is watering right now from just thinking about it! I cant remember eating a better tasting steak what did it for me was the sauce and the juiciness of the steak. Also it was $42 for a 32 oz steak...this is definitely the best deal in town.The bartender was so cool they gave me an after dinner limoncello to clean my palette.Extremely impressed with this place. This restaurant is a MUST try." u"What a disappointing experience this has become. I have been eating at this Resturant for many years and it seem to just keep slipping and slipping. The service was totally disappointing and the food was just mediocre. When out waiter heard that we weren't drinking that night he acted like he couldn't wait to get rid of us. I guess he felt the bill wouldn't be large enough to for his full attention. The food was fair and the portions keep getting smaller and smaller. Very disappointing. I use to love this place but the last few visits confirm what I feared.... This place has lost its touch and is now only looking to get the tourist theater crowd in and then out. Find another place. This isn't worth it any longer. :-(" u'This place was everything we thought it would be. After reviewing what seemed like an endless number of restaurants on yelp before our trip to NYC we picked Fiorentina based on the usual yelp criteria. It did not disappoint. The atmosphere was cozy and intimate the service was flawless and the food was amazing. My app saut\xe9ed Octopus and Calimari was perfect. Dinner Filet (rare) topped with Foie Gras was to die for. My only problem was my own - I wanted one of everything....Tip for families. My daughter who is 11 ordered pasta and tomato sauce with basil off the menu. Not even half way thru she said she was stuffed. The next time I looked over her plate was clean and she was smiling.' u'Are they open? \xa0I can not ever get through on the phone. \xa0Its always busy and there are no dates anytime on Opentable?' u"Wow! \xa0Came for the tartufo ravioli and did they deliver! \xa0Great great sauce and pasta. I'm definitely returning. Maybe need a trip back to NYC just to come here.The salad with Gorgonzola was very simple. Just iceberg lettuce and a light cream based Gorgonzola sauce. The lettuce was fresh and crunchy. The sauce was tasty and still light." u"Attentive service tasty food on target desserts and tasty wine (from Italy no less) at less than $100/pp (after tip).Came here with a few friends last week where we chowed down on mussels (okay) calamari (tasty could have been more crispy) and 2 porterhouses for 2 (every bit as tasty as they say although I've had better meat elsewhere). All were fans of the side of creamed spinach that came with our steak dinners. Of sides ordered my sauteed mushrooms were most quickly devoured but we weren't fans of the mashed potatoes (tasted of the instant/box variety) and the fried artichokes (crispy when warm but when chilled- tough and kind bland)Our server was very good frequently coming by our table to ensure our glasses (both wine and water) were never empty even ensuring we ordered a 2nd bottle to split.Highlight of dinner was the desserts. SO and his friend both got the chocolate pudding with lady finger. By the way they devoured it I'd say it was good. Another friend got the tartufo (incredibly delicious) and I enjoyed my mixed fruit tart served on a flaky shell.Overall dinner was a good experience. We did not feel rushed even as the restaurant filled up and the food was decent. If I ever find myself in the theater district with time & money to burn craving steak I wouldn't mind paying a revisit." u"I love this place and have had some fantastic all-day lunches and unending dinners here. \xa0I'm usually here in a decently-sized group and Bistecca are more than happy to accommodate 6 8 or 10-person tables. \xa0Now when you're with that sized group you can really play with the menu.Antipasti should start your meal - their shaved prosciutto salami parmiggiano and olives are all top-notch. \xa0I've never tried the seafood tower but looking over at adjacent tables has filled me with envy. \xa0For your appetizer I have to recommend something from the sea - their grilled octopus is excellent but I have a special place in my heart for their calamari and baked clams. \xa0For a main course you can go with steak but the veal with shaved truffles is my personal and best advice to you. \xa0It doesn't come with much of a side (unless of course you count the incredibly creamy sauce over the veal) so if you have a few people at your table you should also order a risotto with truffles to share. \xa0They shave the truffle table-side so you know it is the absolute real deal and the taste is divine. \xa0Now you may be thinking - what to drink? \xa0There's only one answer - vino rosso. \xa0Look along the back wall and you'll see a marvelous selection. \xa0If it's a little too much to take in your waiter or the maitre will be glad to give you some advice. \xa0Now the drinking shouldn't end once your meal is over. \xa0Have a porto and if you've left some space for their fantastic cheesecake that espresso you are thinking of would really be better with a little bit of sambuca. \xa0It's easy to miss this unassuming little restaurant but once you've been you'll be back. \xa0Just make sure this is your last stop for the day as you'll be so pleasantly full nothing else is getting done before tomorrow." u'My friends and I were just walking around looking for a place to eat when we stumbled across this little restaurant around the time square area. \xa0What drew my friend in was a sign on the window that indicated Tuscan steak so we decided to give it a try. \xa0The restaurant has a price fixed menu with a decent selection. \xa0I ended up choosing a pasta with salmon and asparagus for my entr\xe9e polenta for my starter and a ny cheesecake for my desert. \xa0Price was about $25 plus tax and tip. \xa0Overall the food quality was good but what really stood out to me was the service. \xa0Our waiter was nice and talkative and cracked a joke everyone once and awhile. \xa0Overall I would definitely recommend this place to other friends.' u'Solid comfortable reataurant. \xa0Above average food and great service. \xa0Made reservations was seated immediately. Decent menu selection. \xa0Surprisingly reasonable prices.']
3.Trattoria Trecolori,[u'Loved the decor and ambiance. I went on a Thursday evening about 7pm. Was seated immediately. I ordered the chicken parm and a Brooklyn lager. I love that they tenderize the chicken so its flattened well and cooks evenly. There was a nice balance of flavor with the cheese sauce breading and chicken. The dish comes with spaghetti and a marinara. The portion was on the small side but that was a good thing - normally I find that Italian places give too much pasta but this was just right!Happy to get the check and split when I saw the dessert menu I had to order the tiramisu and OMG was I glad that I did! It was so delicate and light. It did not have an overly coffee flavor (which is a bad thing imo). Would definitely come back here in the future. I would even try to bring a 2nd or 3rd date here.' u"Was a little hesitant when my friend brought me to this spot for dinner and I was quite surprised on how good the food (sorta basing it off just that one dish I had..hah) was considering it's located in a touristy area. The service and staff were great. I also really liked the space. So what I had and totally recommend if you go here is the linguine with clams. It was pretty spot on! I devoured it. The portion was sort of small for $20 but...this is what you get for being in a touristy area in NYC. Oh also it comes with complimentary bread and it was nice and warm. I would come again if I had to go to a show nearby or something but definitely not somewhere I would go out of my way for." u'Great place for dinner in an otherwise super touristy area. \xa0Portions are generous ingredients seem fresh the dessert is delicious and the bill is surprisingly affordable at the end of it all.Doesn\'t hurt that the service is fast and efficient - they obviously cater to the Broadway crowd (you can tell from the pace of the meal and also the fact that this place tends to empty out by 8pm). They definitely make it a point to get you fed happy and out the door but not in a way that feels rushed or pushy or anything.Highly recommend the squid ink pasta which is super inky and flavorsome and I could eat over and over and over again for dinner. \xa0One of those "what if you were stuck on a desert island" deal. \xa0And for sure one of the better renditions of the dish that I\'ve tried. \xa0Also worth listening to their specials (even if they\'re hard to hear) as I\'ve had a couple good entrees from off the menu. \xa0Nice to have a decent Italian place in this part of town :)' u"Was seated super fast for walking in around 630 pm on a Friday. The restaurant is huge so it's really good for big groups and families. It's also close to Times Square so I wasn't sure if it was one of those touristy restaurants. It actually wasn't. The food was delish. I had the squid ink pasta with a variety of seafood in it $24. My bf ordered the sausage rigatoni which tasted lighter and more al dente but just as yummy." u'This food here is remarkable!! I had the Caprese Salad and lamb. \xa0Delicious! \xa0The service is fantastic! My only criticisms are the balsamic vinegar and bread are mediocre. But I did save room for the delicious dinner.' u"I wish I lived in New York City just so I could experience the food at this restaurant again and again! I ordered the popular seafood with squid ink pasta that just about everyone at the restaurant ordered. I'm a wimp though so I requested a pasta other than the squid ink pasta to which the waiter happily complied with. I ate EVERYTHING on my plate! It was so delicious.Great food great location and great atmosphere. I highly recommend this place!" u'I am so confused. In a city of SOOOOO much amazing food - how does this place have 4 stars??When we are in the city we basically do two things. Go to a ton of shows and eat a lot of good food. Unfortunately this was the one night that I did not have reservations anywhere and just made my husband find something that had relatively high marks on yelp and was close to where we were seeing a show. The place was BUSY. I figured "must be good". We couldn\'t even get a table. Our only option was the bar. Everything we had was just blah. It was fine. Just nothing special. My primavera had no taste and my husbands chicken was just mediocre as well. Service was fine. No complaints really. I just can\'t comprehend in a city that is basically the mecca of good food why this one has such good reviews. Maybe I hit them on a bad night? I just can\'t see myself wasting another trip to give them another try. Meh is right.' u'Our waiter Carlos was very courteous and considerate.The Fettuccine Alfredo and Cannoli were decadent!The salmon was also tasty I def recommend this place and will be back.This restaurant is truly one of the best in NYC' u'Recently moved into the Hells Kitchen area and my roommates and I decided to have an outing here at Trattoria Trecolori through a recommendation of a friend!The atmosphere is very nice and upscale and we found the food delicious! We ordered the * Linguine nere alla Monsignore ($22) - Homemade black (squid ink) linguini. They were generous with the seafood portions and price was beyond reasonable!* Tortenni alla Pana ($16) - comes with prosciutto ham* Veal Sorrentino ($22) - veal cutlets topped with prosciutto eggplant and mozzarella. We saved room for dessert and ordered the Tartufo (Pistachio) -- Iced Cream $8. The server was patient and offered suggestions/recommendations for our table. Price-wise the food was reasonable for a $$ Italian restaurant in the heart of Times Square! We definitely enjoyed our meal (with a bottle of red wine.. ) and would come back!' u'Went for dinner before a show on Saturday the 9th of July. Traffic was horrendous so I had the wife and kids get out of the car and walk ahead to hold the table. They walked on a half hour late no problem. I ended up getting there over an hour past my reservation time. The staff let my wife and kids hang out at the table for over an hour without making them order. This is prime time mind you. Anyway we ordered and shared a mixed fried seafood appetizer. \xa0The calamari was soft and perfectly cooked not rubbery as most places make it. The kids ordered tortellini with ham in cream sauce. Fresh made pasta perfectly done. I ordered calamari cooked in ink with zucchini over risotto and awesome is an understatement. My wife ordered black ink spaghetti with mixed seafood also excellent. Add some wine and espresso with black sambuca and desserts and we were ready to go. Service was excellent prompt friendly and professional and the food was top notch. I highly recommend this restaurant for a nice dinner.' u'Given the price tag Trattoria has everything I have asked for - relaxed feeling decent pasta and good wine.Our group of five came here right after they opened at noon and the restaurant was already filled with crowds. While we were served a bit slow (understand that part given the crowd at brunch time) we really enjoyed the squid ink pasta with assorted seafood. Tried their tiramisu towards the end - smooth and not too sweet love it! Would like to come back and try others!' u'Boyfriend and I came here for a date night. It is half a block from Time square. The ambience was very romantic with dim lighting and candle lit dinner tables. My boyfriend got the spaghetti blogonese and I got the carbonara. We received free bread and butter and both dishes followed within ten minutes. \xa0I have been trying to find a place comparable to the pasta from Little Italy in San Diego. First bite and I was blown away with my dish. It was creamy savory with generous portions of chunky prosciutto. I wished I could have finished it but the portions were decently sized. My boyfriend finished his whole plate. He said he liked it but didnt love it. Still we would reccommend this place for a romantic date night.' u'My brother his gf and I came in Tuesday evening and it was pretty busy (but not packed). By the time we left (8:30pm) half the place cleared out. Since it\'s in the middle of touristy stuff I would still make reservations just to be safe. I forgot the exact names of our dishes but we got the calamari for 2 (app) squid ink pasta the spaghetti bolognese tiramisu and a bottle of wine. Everything was delicious and they gave good portions. The squid ink pasta is definitely worth the money. There were good amounts of seafood meats included (scallops mussels clams). It was amazing. I could have eaten two bowls of this. The tiramisu was one of the best I\'ve had in a while. Not too soggy and the coffee/rum part was not overpowering. I was pleasantly surprised that it was on the fluffier side. I\'m so used to tiramisu being on the soggier side. The only thing that kind of irked me was our waiter. Service was decent but he made me feel very awkward. I have a feeling it may have been cause I gave off a vibe that I didn\'t want to be bothered but he kept looking and talking to me as if I was acting strange. The kind of "you\'re weird" look. However that was a minor thing; not something that would prevent me from coming back. Food is great and this restaurant is one of the "quiet" ones. Perfect for family dinners or date night!' u"Don't let the proximity to Times Square and herd of tourists put you off: this is a solid Italian fair. Very good pastas excellent soups and attentive service. Minestrone was delicious and very fresh clam pasta flavorful and generously loaded with clams salads fresh and crispy. We celebrated my sons birthday here and the kids were so tired they actually refused desert (I know WHAT??) but based on everything else I am sure the kitchen of this restaurant knows its way to a good tiramisu." u'We went after a show with a reservation for 6 at 4:30. It got very busy soon after we arrived but the service was FANTASTIC the whole time. \xa0Drinks and bread were there right away. The entrees arrived quickly and tasted wonderful. Everyone loved their choice. I think anything from the menu would be great. We also enjoyed tiramisu and gelato for dessert. The desserts were presented especially beautifully!' u"I loved everything about this restaurant and I couldn't believe it's in the heart of the theater district. I was bracing for something not so good and we were pleasantly overjoyed with the entire experience. The servers were friendly knowledgeable and pleasant. The menu offered a wide selection of choices for saldas entrees and deserts. We enjoyed delicious wine and the tricolor salad. The moscata was sweet and chilled. \xa0I had a deliciously prepared meat lasagna with sausage and ground meats with a pungent tomato sauce and Kay enjoyed a pasta Primavera with a mound of perfectly saut\xe9ed vegetables with bowtie pasta. Her food was bathed in olive oil and garlic. \xa0We also enjoyed the espressos and the chocolate and vanilla gelato for dessert. I would definitely return and now I need to buy tickets for every show in the area so I can enjoy more and more meals at this lovely Italian restaurant." u"Went in before the theatre so we booked a reservation at 5 PM just in case. When we got there they were about half full but that changed over the next 20 minutes and they were almost to capacity on the first floor at least by then.We barely got to our seats before our waiter got to our table to take our drink order - that's not a complaint - he was very attentive but gave us time to look things over and place our order. We got a couple of glasses of wine and they were VERY reasonably priced and good. The wine selection was good and while some of the wines had a pretty significant markup there were options available that were quite reasonable.We placed our orders for penne arrabibiata (basil garlic and red pepper) and farfalle primavera (pasta veggies mushrooms etc.) and they came out in record-breaking time and were piping hot. The prices were very reasonable. A basket of bread was efficiently delivered to the table as well and we could have been in and out in about a half an hour. We lingered for a few minutes over our wine before heading to the theatre at 6. The pastas were prepared just as described on the menu and were very tasty and a dinner portion just right for us so that we didn't have any leftover. Great fresh tastes and as mentioned the service is incredibly fast and efficient. Great place to stop before the theatre and you can be in and out as fast as you need to be." u"Good overall experience. But I've had better Italian food. Even in the theater district.We had 6:30 reservations but arrived a little after 6 and they were able to seat us right away. This is a quick turn restaurant.With most of the patrons going on to a Broadway show from here.To start our evening we ordered two glasses of white wine recommended by our waiter Terre Del Barolo Gavi. \xa0We enjoyed our wine while noshing on the Trecolori Antipasto a selection of Italian meats and cheeses. \xa0For our main courses the better half had the Scarpariello chicken and sweet sausage in a Rosemary cream sauce served with vegetables and potatoes. \xa0I went with the Linguine Nere Monsignore squid ink pasta served with shrimp scallops clams mussels and calamari. This was a first for me never having squid ink pasta before.To finish off our meal we ordered two cappuccinos and split the Tiramisu. This place will set you back a few dollars to say the least but its proximity to several theaters is worth it. Mangia Bene!" u'It seemed that our waiter was at the end of a long day but the food was fantastic.' u"Great Italian food reasonable prices and friendly service! \xa0What more can you ask for? \xa0While the restaurant was somewhat empty but not unexpected on a Sunday afternoon at 4 pm the service was excellent! \xa0Our server was extremely friendly and went over the entire menu with us pointing out his recommendations as well as some variations of dishes that I enjoyedWe ordered a Caprese with prosciutto as an appetizer. \xa0The mozzarella di bufala was amazing in this dish. \xa0So simple yet elegant and delicious. For dinner we ordered squid ink pasta with seafood the seafood risotto with white sauce instead of red sauce on the recommendation of the server rack of lamb and the special of the day sea bass.The squid ink pasta had a great texture and full of flavor from the squid ink. \xa0The accompanying sauce and seafood medley were fresh and seasoned well. \xa0The seafood risotto in a white sauce stole the show for us. \xa0The risotto was cooked perfectly that it would nearly melt in your mouth with just enough give that the texture stood out. \xa0The white sauce was mild and complemented the risotto rather than overpower it. \xa0The rack of lamb was served sliced into a four bone serving. \xa0Perfect doneness at a medium rare. \xa0It was some great lamb! \xa0Last but not least the Sea Bass was an excellent selection. \xa0This should be on their regular menu. \xa0It was flavorful and easily broke apart with a fork. \xa0It sat in a wonderfully flavorful but not overly seasoned sauce.Trattoria Trecolori provided some great Italian fare prepared very well with all the dishes being seasoned so perfectly with mild sauces that magnify the main ingredients. \xa0It's difficult to find these days where the dishes are not laden with salt and/or sugar that overpowers all the other ingredients."]
40.Danji,[u"So good!! Defn recommend. Affordable eclectic Asian cuisine with a relaxing atmosphere and electro/pop music selection. Must try's- sashimi with the fried potato bits on top (spicy and delicious) honey garlic wings (to die for sauce) and the black cod (melt in your mouth delicious)! I defn recommend this place for anyone looking for a chill happy hour and apps or a small dinner. Love it!" u'Nice under the radar Korean fusion restaurant I believe they scored a one star michelin rating back in 2012. This place is more like a hole in the wall type of establishment with a few tables and some communal tall ones.Their cuisine which is quite intricate and inventive ressembles the spanish tapas concept where 80% of their menu consisting of small plates reasonably priced so you can sample a lot of dishes without taking a mortgage on your meal. \xa0Pork belly Bulgogi beef sliders Welk salad are a must try yellowtail sashimi and beef tartare with quail egg are fusion reinvented with Korean ingredients.Service is prompt and precise with charming waitstaff as I mentioned before it is a tiny restaurant so it gets crowded very quickly ambiance is cosy. My only issue is the worn down uncomfortable furniture and decor which are not as crisp as new...' u"It was very good food although the seats were tiny not that great spacing - people sit right next to other customers in a same continuous table) - and very very small distance between sits.the food quality was good although the portion was tiny. I felt like I was on diet again (although I'm on diet for like 24/7 but don't really make it real in the terms for the portion and this made my meal to be truly on diet which was impressive.) Was still hungry when I got out.Also the customer service was not that fast. Also it was OVERPRICED AS BUTT!" u"The food is amazing! It's not traditional Korean but more of a fusion refined Korean. Must get the pork belly buns spicy yellowtail sashimi tofu with ginger dressing and soy-poached black cod. The black cod is amazing I would just order that for lunch (it comes with rice) and it's really filling. Fun place to take your friends to and gets really noisy. The space is small and cozy and most likely you'll be sitting either at the bar or the high tables. More difficult to get a seat if you have a large group. Will definitely come back!" u"Let me start off my saying that I'm Korean and when I think Korean food I think of dive-y family style street food. So you can understand my apprehension of going to a fancy Michelin starred Korean joint. Korean food just isn't fancy and I like it that way.My sister claims this place is awesome so I give it a shot. We ordered the tasting menu for 3 people and an additional order of the pork sliders since it wasn't included in the tasting and because everyone on yelp raved about them. Overall everything was pretty good. The first thing to come out was the yellowtail - it was on point and probably my favorite thing off the menu. The fish was fresh and crunch from the cucumbers and spice from the gochujang was absolute perfection. Other notable dishes were the bossam kimchi fried rice and the short rib. I could've done without the bulgogi and pork belly sliders - they were both okay but nothing spectacular.Service was good atmosphere is small and cozy. I think it's a great place for a romantic date but when I'm craving my mother's cooking and have no one to impress I would head elsewhere." u"A really interesting take on Korean food. It's definitely not authentic Korean like Woorijip but they add a western mix to it. For example they have beef sliders filled with Kalbi and cucumber kimchi. They were FANTASTIC.I also like the sauce they put on the spring leaf salad. Vinegar-y but crisp and clean. They have a good list of soju and sake too with big enough bottles to share between two people but small enough that I could see an individual order per bottle. The space isn't that large so I suggest making reservations which we were able to do literally five minutes before walking in. They did seat us at a bar but the long tables were being held for bigger groups - that's understandable. The only caveat is their portions aren't big for the price point. I shared a salad and two plates with a friend along with a small sake bottle and it came out to be $50 per person with both of us leaving hungry. A true Korean cuisine would fill you up for $50." u"Food: pretty awesome. I was there with a few guys. We split the pork and beef tacos to start and our server brought out some fried tofu and some kimchi on the house. Everything was delicious. The tofu was the biggest surprise. So good. Light crisp on the outside. Great taste. The entrees were awesome too. I can't even tell you the name of the dish but basically bunch of rice topped with beef veggies a fried egg and then topped with some Korean red sauce served in a sizzling cast iron skillet. I would get the exact same thing again but I'd double up on the appetizers!Service: great. Our waitress was so nice. Very attentive. No complaintsAtmosphere: small open windows clean professional good for work lunch or food with friends. Misc: not kid friendly in my view" u"As a Korean in Manhattan I often find myself frustrated at the lack of good Korean food in this borough. \xa0Like yeah I know I can go to Flushing or Fort Lee and get some good good but aint nobody got time for that. \xa0So I made this reservation for 5 at Danji for lunch with fairly low expectations. \xa0I saw the four-star rating here but assumed some inflation because of the aforementioned dearth of quality Korean in the City.Danji forgive me. \xa0I was wrong to doubt you and now I have a place I can take my foodie friends and fellow Korean food aficionados without the attendant shame at the misrepresentation of my motherland's cuisine. \xa0This place is bomb. \xa0The space is unassumingly small but wow they know what's up.Apps: Veg dumplings were pretty forgettable but YOU NEED TO GET THE MANDOO TACOS (we got the bulgogi). \xa0Seriously these tacos are amazing. \xa02 tacos per order so get enough for everyone cuz you won't regret it. \xa0I'm thinking about getting 2 orders for myself as a takeout treat-yoself lunch sometime. \xa0'Fire' wings were decently fire. \xa0Like definitely both tasty and spicy but if I had to do it again I'd go with another order of the mandoo tacos over the wings. \xa0Gim-bap (Korean-style sushi roll daily special) was great.Banchan (side dishes) and (all their different types of) kimchi have to be ordered separately which is different from normal Korean places that give them to you free of charge. \xa0But then again Danji's banchan and kimchi offerings are superior. \xa0Certainly worth ordering.Entrees: Bibim guksoo 5/5Sashimi salad bibim-bap 5/5 yaaassssChul-sot bibim-bap (hot with crispy rice) 4.5/5Overpriced? \xa0Maybe. \xa0But what in NYC isn't?Service was a bit spotty. \xa0I'll forgive it because I love you Danji" u"Came for restaurant week - thought it was a good deal. \xa0Sat at a high table with another group which I didn't love. \xa0 \xa0I really enjoyed each dish I got - yellowtail (my favorite dish) beef sliders and cod. \xa0Every dish was spicy and really flavorful. \xa0Also loved the cocktail I ordered - guava margarita. \xa0Left feeling like I had a really yummy satisfying meal. \xa0Biggest complaint was that my boyfriend ordered short rib and it was way too fatty to eat. \xa0I tried it and had to spit it out. \xa0He told the waitress that it was inedible but she didn't offer to bring him a different dish." u'Michelin starred Korean restaurants are rare so I was excited to try Danji. This was actually my first Michelin Star experience in New York and the experience was more of a let down. I expected more especially after all the great reviews. We reserved a table for four on a Tuesday night but had to wait a little bit before we got seated. Seating is limited. Danji offers tapas - style dishes grouped by small medium and large plates. \xa0Our group decided to share and sample about 6-7 different items. We tried the spicy korean fire chicken wings kimchi fried rice with an egg on top bulgogi beef sliders and steak tartare to name a few. The dishes were good but in a subtle way. I didn\'t find anything that stood out or had that "wow" factor. \xa0I would rather go to k-town to get Korean food but Danji is great to try once for that Michelin Star experience!' u"Small tapas plates but don't judge just by the size of the dishes. Their pork belly sliders were fantastic and tasted better than other places nearby. Greasy oily and utterly fatty the pork belly were marinated with so much flavor and a bit of spice. You can easily eat about a dozen of them because they taste so great and within a few bites it's gone. Compared to their alternative bulgogi sliders which were not as flavorful and a bit dry. Their two person dishes are nice the oxtail stew was spicy but not too overpowering. The meat was tender and fall off the tail bone soft. It's neat that it's served in a little pot. The soup broth reminded me of the tofu soup you get from other Korean restaurants. Seating is tight and it gets filled in quick. There not much room and not a lot of privacy because most seats are on a cafeteria style bench just elevated higher and with stool like chairs. It's nice they have hooks on the wall and under the table for jackets and bags. Just don't expect much intimacy for a one on one date unless you get a standard table further towards the back." u'Very good meal! Staff was amazing and accommodating. Big portions and great drinks. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because of communal eating.' u"Tl;dr: \xa0nice ambiance but pricey food for what it is not bad but not a stand out given other awesome contemporary Korean offerings in town...This was my second time here. \xa0First was not long after they opened. \xa0Food is good but not sure it's head and shoulders above some of the new crop of non Michelin starred Korean restaurants around town. \xa0The experience is cute - from menus hidden in table drawers to the decor with rows of wooden spoons. The service is ok. \xa0We had:Butternut squash jook (congee) - which was really more of a butternut squash pur\xe9e/soup with a Korean twist pieces of mochi rice cakes pine nuts and I think dates under the surface. \xa0This was my favorite dish from the meal. Tofu appetizer - also great like a traditional Korean cold tofu side dish but the tofu was fried (warm) and the sauce was tasty Bo Ssam - pork belly you wrap in thin sheets or daikon. \xa0Nice twist but not impressed especially after the strong opening appetizers.Spicy cod - again not impressed Kimchi side was very standard.Now it could be that we just ordered the wrong things but a number of these were recommended by the waitress. \xa0So I'm inclined to think it's representative of the overall quality.Was hoping for the tasty multigrain rice a lot of Korean restaurants have but it's white rice only.No dessert menu - a little surprised. \xa0The first Michelin restaurant I've tried that didn't bother with any kind of dessert even a piece of chocolate with the check.Overall wasn't impressed. \xa0Ambiance is pretty but food wise I much prefer Oiji Barn Joo or Goggan." u'What a find! Came here for an early dinner before a Broadway show. Incredibly small restaurant so make reservations. \xa0We ended up getting their set "favorites" menu and was not disappointed. \xa0The black cod entree was one of the most decadent things I\'ve ever tasted. \xa0Buttery cod!! Their famous wings failed to impress me but it might be due to all the yelpers who over hyped it before I got there. The daikon wrapped pork belly was tasty as well. Great service and atmosphere and such flavorful food. A must and gem in this area. Too bad they didn\'t have hot tea or dessert on their menu!' u'We went there as a recommendation from a friend. Had to sit at the bar as the tables were held up for reservation.The barman was nice the food was excellent.We had the restaurant week menu.' u'This place is absolutely lovely albeit a little on the pricey side. \xa0But it is my belief that you are paying for the experience as much as you are the actual food. The garlic wings come to you with a nice saucy crunch and very moist meat inside. While the sweet potato noodles are unexpectedly sweet and plentiful. \xa0If you are going with another person only order one. Trust me. \xa0Besides you will want to focus on the drinks because they are delicious. Perfect post or pre theater meal.' u'Great place to spend a night chatting with friends but too narrow and noisy for dating' u"Korean tapas place - definitely innovative! I came here with my family for dinner before a Broadway show. Food was average ambience was better. Food: we ordered the butternut squash soup yellowtail sashimi honey wings bulgogi sliders spicy pork sliders steak tartar the japchae and the kimchi bacon fried rice. Standouts were the spicy pork sliders yellowtail sashimi and the fried rice. The sliders were super juicy and flavorful. Sashimi was deliciously buttery with a spicy kick. The fried rice came out on a sizzling black plate topped with soft scrambled egg and had a generous amount of sweet bacon throughout - YUM. Honey wings and japchae were a bit too sweet for my taste. Butternut squash soup tasted good but not memorable. Steak tartar was okay - interestingly paired with quail egg and Asian pear but would've been better with some sort of bread to dip.Ambience: this restaurant is small! There were probably 3 or 4 long tables and you'll be sharing tables with strangers. Still there was definitely enough room for dishes (they bring about 2 out at a time) and the environment was quiet and intimidate enough so you could still carry on a conversation. I think it'd be a great place for a date.Main con is the price of the food. The dishes were small but came with hefty price tags. They recommend 2 dishes per person so it adds up real fast. I guess that's what you get when going to any tapas place." u"As an authentic Korean I thought this place is nice in general but not entirely satisfying.1. We made a reservation for dinner but still had to wait about 20 minutes which kind of tells how they manage the table schedules. It's a small place and there are high chances that you have to sit closely by strangers.2. The dishes come out pretty quickly but they go away even faster- portion is pretty small which consistently made me think that they are quite overpriced.3. We started with steak tartar which was delicious highly recommended followed by spicy pork belly sliders--delighted us the most and then we had short ribs which was a bit salty for me but still very soft and tasty.4. Wish there was a dessert menu but they don't carry desserts I guess" u'I was very unimpressed by this place. Came in for dinner with high expectations considering it has a Michelin star but left feeling unsatisfied. The ambiance and setting were neat and charming given the tiny space and the servers were very polite but the food was severely lacking in flavor. I could have just gone to an actual Korean restaurant and been much more satisfied. The so-called "contemporary twist" on the food is just a way to get away with Americanizing the dishes by numbing the spices with unnecessary fatty ingredients (heavy cream butter and cheese).1) The Butternut Squash Jook was good but unremarkable and not even remotely Korean-passing. It was a regular cream-based soup with a few Mochi tossed in.2) The Bossam was probably my favorite item of the night. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and the flavors and spices were delicious. The kimchi side was good too and the cabbage wrap was nicely pickled. It was a great balance of Korean flavors with a Western method of cooking.3) The Dduk Bokki in severe contrast with the previous dish was a complete sham. It utilized the thick-cut rice noodles of traditional dduk bokki but that was the only honest aspect of the dish. The noodles along with some sausage sat atop what tasted like barbecue sauce and were topped off with a hefty amount of melted cheese. It was very confusing and not in a good way. It was dry instead of soupy and overall was more reminiscent of a barbecue pizza than any Korean dish. I just did not get it.4) My sister is vegan so she ordered a noodle stir-fry off the vegan menu. They were pretty good but also so so damn ordinary. I could definitely get those just about anywhere else for way cheaper. Actually I\'m pretty sure I could make them at home.5) We also got a fried veggie pancake (I don\'t remember exactly what it was called) but it was saturated in oil and pretty bland. The dipping sauce was weak in flavor as well. Also could have gotten that anywhere else.The wine was ok I guess. I have no qualms about dishing out for good food but I HATE spending good money on food I did not enjoy. There are way better restaurants around the area and this place just wasn\'t worth it.']
38.Dim Sum Palace,[u"Four words: DIM. SUM. ALL. DAY.The dim sum is fresh and made in house to serve service great (especially considering they've just opened). No carts but I'd trade any day for dim sum past noon. And happy hour 3-6 50% dim sum and cocktail? Ridiculous! A true gem in Hell's Kitchen almost feels impossible to find good dim sum outside Chinatown. Plus free guest wi-fi! Look no further for an awesome Cantonese meal." u"Hidden on restaurant row in a Tourist area - but still in Hell's kitchen you no longer need to go to Chinatown Flushing or Queens for Dim Sum. It's new so it's clean (clean Chinese bathrooms!). Pros:1) Dim Sum Happy Hour 3-6pm (50% off All Dim Sum and Drinks)2) The Dim Sum is made in-house and the chef is actually from RedEgg in Chinatown3) Mostly Cantonese fair but there would be some random Chinese-American and Mandarin stuff on the Menu. Honestly don't do it. But I do like myself some Sweet n Sour fried Chicken from time to time.4) The staff can speak English well Cantonese and some Mandarin.5) There is online ordering/delivery. But I think there might be a few kinks right now. 6) Service is very nice. It's a little less Chinatown/rude mannerism and they clearly care a little more. Don't expect the Ritz service though.They are probably slightly understaffed if it is busy.7) They will take reservations but only 2 large tables for Dim Sum on the weekends. 8) Love the sauces for dim sum and try the (ginger/scallion combo is legit)Cons:1) No Carts but it's almost better this way. 2) Small bar no drafts on Tap. Only 4 types of Beer and sometimes they sell out.3) You obviously pay more than Chinatown ($5 per an item vs. $2 but go during HH and honestly - it's just less of a hassle to get in/out of Chinatown when you are out of work or in the area)4) The pictures don't always match the items!!! For example the green pea shoots wrap dumpling is not green! And the spicy shrimp doesn't look the same.5) Variety is low but there is still a lot to choose from. Mostly dumplings you are don't going to get like tofu pudding chicken feet or any of those things here. 6) No outdoor seating. I love trying to sit outside on restaurant row. They should really figure out how to get a few chairs/tables outside. 7) Chinese people here charge for tea!! And personally I need tea at every meal - but it's good tea. So whatever. 8) Get a Beijing Mule. 9) They deliver up until 70th!! I like just missed it damn it!Now on to the DIm Sum:1) Shrimp Haw Gao - get this2) I really appreciate that there are 3 different types of Shu Mai (Pork/Shrimp Combo just Chicken and Seafood Combo).3) There is a Dim Sum Platter Combo Sample (get this during HH!). This is like whatever the Chef decides to serve you - but there is an all vegetarian combo too! If you don't eat pork no problem! If you don't eat shrimp- well that kind of suxs for you. 4) I did not like the Taro/Pork dumpling (too chewy)5) Love anything with Shrimp Chives and they had a Peashoot/Shrimp one tooPeople are cool food is good Dim Sum all day and it's in a convenient here. If you want that authentic experience- you go to Chinatown. But if you want a clean bathroom with some in-house made Dim Sum and like a few cocktails with good people - this is a great place to check out. My Cantonese heritage would be proud." u"I had my doubts. How could there be a good dim sum place outside of Chinatown in Manhattan and Flushing in Queens? Dim Sum Palace is also pretty close to Times Square where it's flooded with tourists. But we gave it a shot and it was a pleasant surprise. The dim sum here was more hits than misses. I appreciated that most dishes tasted pretty clean cutting out excessive oiliness. While the menu was relatively small for dim sum it was still a positive experience. I'm also a fan of Dim Sum Palace not pushing around carts. At least the dim sum is steamed/made fresh." u"I'm so happy this place has opened up in Hell's Kitchen. There's a dearth of good Cantonese/dim sum places in midtown so Dim Sum Palace is a very welcome addition. The place is new so they're still ironing out some service/delivery issues but my husband and I didn't have a problem when we dined there over the weekend. No wait around 11:30AM and our waitstaff was very attentive. We ordered a couple classic dim sum dishes: sticky rice char siu bao (BBQ pork buns) shumai and har gau (shrimp dumplings) as well as a tofu + salty fish + chicken casserole (one of my favorite dishes). Everything was really fresh and we didn't wait long for any of our dishes. They serve dim sum all day everyday so I'm looking forward to returning on weekdays to get my fix. And there's late night congee for $2!Prices are a little higher than Chinatown but that's to be expected given the location and quality. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back!" u"Overpriced and flavorless. Paid $72 before tax/tip for 2 people for a late dim sum lunch. The only good dishes were the snow pea leaves and the scallion pancake but those are really hard to mess up. Tried 4 different types of dumplings and shumai and all of them lacked flavor. The mixed mushroom dumplings were inedible. Service was also terrible. They didn't bring out any sauces for the scallion pancake or the dumplings and shumai. There wasn't even soy sauce at the table. We had to hail down the waitress twice to remind her to bring some. We were more than halfway done with everything before any sauces ever arrived. The waitress also had to ask us which dishes we were still waiting on - apparently she didn't know what had been brought out or not. This seems to be a common theme since when we arrived the party next to us was quite vocal about their anger with the service when they berated the waitress for having never brought out several of the dishes they ordered and ended up cancelling them all because they had been waiting quite some time.Can't figure out for the life of me how there are such good reviews for this place. Definitely will not be returning." u"Dim Sum Palace is legitimate!I came in not expecting much - a Dim Sum restaurant in tourist saturated Theatre District? I'd usually pass but my girlfriend and her sister convinced me to try it for fun.It's very clean and modern. Very friendly service - I felt welcomed as they spoke in their native tongue to test my girlfriend and I (we're Chinese).As for the food: you get what you pay for. It's more expensive but the food is DEFINITELY a step up in quality than the Chinatown/Sunset Park/Flushing restaurants I've been to. I knew it right when the Buddha's Delight dumplings came out that they weren't playing. The skin was extra sticky and had a generous amount of fresh filling. Texture was perfect and I could tell the chef was into his craft. Other dishes (Green Tea balls etc.) also didn't have as much oil as other places and had noticeably higher quality.We also shared the same sentiment with our entree: HK Pan Fried Noodles. It was fresher and the sauce was much more viscous than the other places. Was definitely into it.Tea was also the perfect complement and closer. Although we were finished with our meal and ready to pay our waiter took the teapot for a refill as we were waiting for the check (I initially thought he was getting a head start in cleaning). It was a nice touch in hospitality that I noticed and we definitely didn't feel like they were trying to kick us out after our meal.Worth mentioning: Dim Sum Happy Hour is 3-6 and Dim Sum items are half off. You'll be paying the same Chinatown prices but the food will be double the quality! I'll probably be stopping by here again - especially if I'm around for the happy hour." u'Just had Peking duck which is not the ordinary Peking duck you eaten before. There is a lot of meat in the bun!' u"I came to Dim Sum Palace a few weeks ago when it first opened up. I did not discount the review based on the fact that they just opened up and were still working on the efficiency of the kitchen as they were overwhelmed. Regardless though - the manager and waiter profusely apologized for any delay and checked to see if we received our food during our wait. Otherwise - i came here with a party of 4 and we ordered dimsum dishes. Dim sum menu is not as extensive as the ones you will find in Chinatown/Flushing/Elmhurst but it offers the main ones that you would want to order. All of them were pretty good. I tried probably 11-12 of them and they all came out hot and fresh!One down vote is that the pictures on the menu don't line up with the items that came out at all. For example I ordered a fried tofu with shrimp and other seasonings on it just like the pictures had shown. However the item came out as a steamed egg tofu with shrimp and no other seasoning. They did apologize for the confusion and said that the menu was wrong. No additional compensation was given also which i didn't mind because i liked teh dish either way. The restaurant is clean and the waiters all speak English. Note: The tea costs money. Also the money Also - you order by marking off items on a menu and handing it to the waiter. If a 2nd round is needed the waiter will come by with a another checklist menu to order. The prices are higher than your typical dimsum place but for the tradeoff of better service and cleanliness. I'll take it." u"At this place now. Food is just okey. Be careful if you order food based on the pix you see on the menu bc they can be very different when you get them. That's my main complaint. I ordered the mushroom dumplings but they came out n I had no idea they were the mushroom dumplings. They were in different shapes than what's being presented in the menu. And they were also made with different type of skins / wraps than what I observed from the menu. \xa0 Nothing bad but just different than what's presented on the menu. Felt a little bit misled by them." u"The food was so good. I love dim sum and this is some of the best I've tasted. And I travel! lol General Tso's chicken is amazing. I also recommend shumai shrimp dumpling and shrimp rolls. Happy hour 50% off from 3-6pm made dinner really inexpensive!" u'Great dim sum \xa0without the carts. But definitely a great food. Happy hour half off dim sum 3p-6p Monday thru Friday. Just a good as China Town.If your in the area check it out.' u"We were looking for a place to have post theater dinner and my wife spied Dim Sum Palace on Restaurant Row. I was skeptical since most of the restaurants on W 46 are pricey and fairly well-rooted and old fashioned. The restaurant had only been open for two weeks and we asked for a table in the front rather than the back because it was empty.That should have changed by now as we had an excellent time. Great service and honest exciting Dim Sum.The Shredded Roast Duck Dumplings and Shanghai Juicy Pork Bun were delicious. I liked the consistency and flavor of the Sticky Rice Pork Lotus leaf which had additional texture for a surprising effect.The Shu Mai proved to us that the chef was a product of Hong Kong experience.In the Time square neighborhood you won't find a better Dim Sum and the prices were fair especially in this high rent area. Let's \xa0hope that the lease fees keep Dim Sum Palace around for a long time. Captain Kevin Yan assisted our server who was also very attentive but I cannot remember her name \xa0( or maybe I think I have shared enough secrets for now \xa0) It's too bad people can flame a new restaurant for slow pick up \xa0or delivery during opening weeks and hurt the reviews of owners and staff who have good intentions and who may not know how to comment on such posts .No I \xa0don't know the owners or anyone who works there . This post is to say that we loved Dim Sum Palace!" u'High quality delicious and authentic. A little bit of a wait for the orders but worth it because they are all prepared fresh. Better than China Town dim sum- a must go!' u'Seems like I\'m going to be the combo breaker amid all these glowing reviews (which makes me somewhat suspicious like all the good reviewers are getting a percent off if they review while dining). I know they\'re a new restaurant and probably going through some growing pains but oh boy their delivery sucks--a pity since they\'re food is soooo good (hence the additional star). I\'ve ordered twice: the first time around the food was late. The second time the food was super early but I got the wrong order. When I called to notify them of the mishap they told me to keep it they\'ll have to remake the wrong other I got to resend it to the correct person (which implied they didn\'t care about me as a customer since I got a smaller order) and next time I order I\'ll get it free. Since they knew there wouldn\'t be a next time this was pretty much a nice way of saying "Haha go fuck yourself." Then another delivery guy showed up 5 minutes later after the first guy (seriously their whole delivery system is a mess) with the correct order and I handed him the wrong one. Like I said earlier it\'s a pity they haven\'t ironed out the kinks in their delivery service. Their food really isn\'t that bad.' u'Awesome dimsum and loved the crispy garlic ribs. Staff is friendly and very helpful.Definitely recommend!' u'Went there last week with my friend. Everything is fresh and the price is great since we got there in time for half price dim sum' u"Passed by and it said Grand Opening all day dimsum. Decided to give it a try. Their food was yummy. Had their steam pork buns and it was better than some restaurants in chinatown. Also tried their stir fry beef cubes with veggies. Wasn't too heavy. Perfect with a bowl of white rice. Would definitely come back to eat again." u"Omg the best dim sum home delivered far from 13 blocks. Thank you so much . It's gonna be my favorite from now. West lake beef soup awesome cured my hangover .Next time I should better tip the delivery boy" u"Short review: Amazing dim sum here!! Incredibly friendly staff and during happy hours (3-6) the dim sum is half off! You have to eat here! Long review: I grew up eating dim sum and my family would often trek out to Chinatown for it. But this place has dim sum even better than what could be found in Chinatown for half the price during happy hour! It is such a good deal and I recommend everyone coming here to eat the food. They also serve family style entrees which are also delicious but with a name like Dim Sum Palace the best thing on the menu is the dim sum. Cheers to the dim sum chef and the wonderful staff here that are attentive and kind. You won't find a better place like this in MIDTOWN. The dim sum is like a steal in this area! Super authentic and juicy it'll make you come back wanting more. The restaurant itself is great for groups and a couple and the staff is very accommodating. I came here with 12 friends and they pushed two tables for us. We ate the food so fast we forgot to take photos. I came back here a second time and took photos (although I did sneak a ha gow (shrimp dumpling) beforehand). P.S. Dim sum tastes better fresh; they offer delivery but for the best experience I recommend dining in." u"Came here after a night out with drinks with friends. We walked 8 blocks to get here and do not regret anything at all! The owner and his wife were our hosts and treated is to a range of fantastic dim sum. I've had dim sum in tons of restaurants and some have disappointed with fake or stale food. Nothing of the sort here. Everything was fresh and delicious. The shrimp dumplings and batter fried shrimp was wonderful.Do yourself a favor and check them out - especially after a night out at the theater."]
19.Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,[u"You can't go wrong with gyu kaku happy hour. Decent quality meat that's fairly cheap. Are there better bbqs? Probably but is gyu kaku everywhere and is it consistently decent? Yes totally! Will your hair and cloths smell of meat afterwards? Yes definitely... Is that awesome? If you're looking for a yakiniku place then it better be!!!Go during lunch or happy hour. This one is less crowded than most of the other ones." u'So much tasty meat seasoned and barbecued to perfection $8 pitchers3 buddiesperfect ambiance for Japanese bbq' u"Absolutely YUM! I've been to two other locations and by far this one has the best costumer service! \xa0Happy hour (3-6pm) is the way to go! It's the easiest way to keep your meal under $100 for two people and completely fill your belly at the same time. We were able to get two appetizers four servings of meat four servings of veggies and the delicious \xa0bibimbap way under a bill!! This location is also very clean and the staff is extremely attentive! This is the first time I've tried the sukiyaki bibimbap!! Delish!!!" u"Honestly I was aiming to go to another place to eat when I happened across Gyu-Kaku and I'm so glad I did. It's such a gem in the chaos that is Times Square. It's just a short walk away from Times Square (borderline Hell's Kitchen) so it's easy to get to without having to deal with the crazy crowds.My timing to come here was great - came here around noon-1pm ish and it wasn't too crowded or anything. Two words: Happy Hour. They have a pretty lengthy Happy Hour from 11:30am-6pm every day and 9:30pm-close on weekdays. Cheaper deals on some of their food and drinks.My boyfriend and I opted not to do the BBQ this time (because of time constraints) but if we had wanted to the restaurant has convenient pre-selected meals depending how many people in your group. Instead we ordered from the a la cart menu - and everything arrived so quickly! We shared the cucumber appetizer (refreshing!) steamed shrimp dumplings (ended up getting two orders because they were so good) seaweed salad (sadly it's not all seaweed though as I was expecting) chicken garlic noodles bibimbop (stone bowl) and ended with the chocolate lava cake with ice cream. Needless to say was pretty full after all this lolThe staff was friendly and available when needed so I never felt like we had to wait long for anything. Overall an awesome place and I'd definitely want to go back and try the BBQ the next time I'm in town :)" u'Meat lovers rejoice - your carnivorous dreams will become a reality here at Gyu-Kaku. I came here for my birthday dinner and it was everything I could have wanted and more. It has that fun Asian BBQ environment where you can cook your meats in front of you and has great food and happy hour!The menu is essentially split up between pre-organized "packages" of sorts and the a la carte menu. \xa0I highly recommend sticking with one of the pre-organized menus as they\'re meant for sharing and have a lot of options so you and your friends choose what\'s right for you. The A la carte is still great but I find that\'s far less overwhelming for someone like me that wants it all. Definitely take advantage of the happy hour if you can - It\'s 50% off everything. My advice (as well as the hostess that I saw) is to get there a little early if you can and just buy 4 drinks at the bar to take back to your table.' u'Went there during happy hours time from 4pm-6pm.All the cocktails are half prize and such a great drinks.Ordered the BBQ set and had plenty of food to share among the party.Great place to hang out and highly recommended' u'Great foods! Great drinks! Great ambience! Great service! Reasonable price! Good portions!We had the meat lovers package for 6 people. All the meats were so tender and juicy. \xa0They have 3 dipping sauces on each table: regular sweet and spicy. I just wish they had hotter/spicier dipping sauce.Anyway do what we did for some great saving on your bucks: made reservation for 5:30 pm ... Put in all your foods and drinks order before 6pm for that happy hour deal .. The food and drink will come right on dinner time smart move!' u'Japanese yakiniku (BBQ) place with several locations around the world. This location was the first time I have been to one. It is similar to a Korean BBQ in that you can grill meat and veggies yourself at your table. The BBQ aspect of this place is overpriced as you do not get that much meat for what they are charging. However they do have an inexpensive lunch special and a happy hour.If you go before 6pm it is 50% off drinks and select food items. The happy food menu is mostly appetizer stuff like dumplings wings and garlic noodles. However there is enough to choose from to fill up. My friends especially like their bibimbap served in a clay bowl. The drink menu is great too with sake beer wine and some unique cocktails available.' u"Visited: 02/23/2016We came here after watching The Phantom of the Opera and it was totally worth it!!! The wait wasn't long at all (maybe because we had a smaller party?) not sure. We really didn't even wait 10 minutes for a table. The place was packed!! After visiting this place I am totally in love with it because you get your money worth! Their happy hour specials are great!! Plus the food is delicious!! We ordered the Fuji Course for Two People - $65!! We picked:Starters:Miso SoupTuna TatakiGyu-Kaku SaladSukiyaki BibimbapBBQ Items:Harami Skirt Steak MisoPremium Sirloin GarlicToro Beef TareChicken Breast BasilShrimp GarlicGarlic MushroomDessert: S'moreOverall such a great deal and everything was delicious!! We would certainly come back again if we get the chance!! :D" u"Yum! I came here with my co-workers last week and loved it! Having to cook your own food was a pretty cool experience (if you're lazy or STARVING and can't wait to eat then it might not be your cup of tea) especially in a group setting. We had a little bit of everything (Literally. This group can eat!!) and it was all very delicious. I wish they sold whatever marinades they use on the meat I'd totally take some home and experiment.The drinks were okay not bad but didn't blow my mind. I recommend coming in a group or on a date if your SO is open to fun dining ideas." u'The food was a bit underwhelming to me. I had very high expectations coming to Gyu-Kaku since friends were telling me how amazing it was. However when my friends and I got there my friend immediately pointed out that portions were a bit smaller then the other location he\'d been to (in the city). That was an automatic turn off for me. \xa0For appetizers we ordered the edamame spicy tofu and the spicy tuna volcano thing. Typically I am not a fan of tofu but the spicy paste they put on the tofu was really tasty. I did not like the spicy tuna volcano thing at all. I\'ve had many versions of this dish at other restaurants and Gyu-Kaku\'s version was pretty bland in comparison. It is not worth the $8.Nothing much to say about the meats except don\'t expect large or even "normal" portions. The slices of meat were really small. I think I got full off of the appetizers more than anything else. The meat itself was delicious; however I don\'t think I will be returning to this location any time soon. Service was subpar. Staff was friendly but a bit absent minded (over pouring drinks and forgetting orders...). Our grill was also going crazy in the beginning with the flames being pretty big. No one really monitored our grill. All of these factors put together didn\'t really give me the experience that I had anticipated :(' u'Made reservations prior to our arrival. We were brought to our table immediately. Our waiter was great and very helpful. Our food and meats were brought out immediately one after the other as we finished them. Each meat does not take long to cook. It is almost impossible to mess it up. Awesome experience. Glad to know that they have now opened one in Florida!' u"Awesome place my gf suggested!!! We did the Kobe grill for 2 which included miso soup salad 4/5 appetizers 4 choices of meat rice (bimbim bop) grilled veggies and smores! :) we even ordered 2 additional appetizers: tuna volcano (really good) and octopus balls fried! Needless to say my gf and I must have been super hungry bc we are it all!!! LolLove this place! Especially during Happy Hour! Great food good portions good prices and CLEAN! :)Lychee-Tini is also on point! :) I'm going to enjoy my smore! :)" u"I've been to Gyu-Kaku quite a few times at various different locations. They are relatively consistent in their food quality across the board.My favorite go-to time is happy hour though. They have KILLER happy hour specials. Who can beat $4 orders of MEAT and $5 lychee-tinis? Cheap cheap cheap.I've also been there during dinner time ordering their $55 Wagyu beef which was pretty darn good but honestly the other orders of meat can be just as flavorful here for much lower prices.Oh and their spicy tuna avocado is great. Love the crispy seasoned rice it comes on." u"I love the food! I enjoy spending time eating food fresh off the grill whether it's by myself with friends or with family. My favorite thing to at gyu-kaku is catching up with friends while enjoying their good food and their great happy hour drinks. The set courses they have are a great deal for bigger parties but I like to be picky and order ALC. There are a few items I always get when I go to Gyu-Kaku try it and you'll know why. For starters and sides I'd like an order of shishito peppers avocado salad shiitake mushroom rice bibimbap. Now the beef! Kobe Style Kalbi Short Ribs Bistro Hanger Steak Toro Beef and Beef Tongue please! I like to make it extra delicious with some scallion shio sauce! I don't care much for the other meats but I always get my zucchini and mushroom medley vegetables. The desserts are really good too and keep the Geisha Girls coming. The service isn't the greatest so it varies from time to time. The five star rating is just for the solid food they have to offer during happy hour lunch everyday 1130-3PM & dinner everyday 3-6PM. They also offer a later happy hour time from 930-11PM but only Mondays through Thursdays. The staff don't change the grills often enough and sometimes the drinks are a little inconsistence. At times the server would be gone for so long .. I'd forget who my server is!" u'I must say I came in with some low expectations after the long wait but they definitely exceeded it. Japanese BBQ food is amazing we got the Duck NYC beef and Lamb. Meat eaters this place is your heaven.The miso soup rice  garlic noodles and dumplings are good appetizers. The service was amazing and the waitress took really good care of us. Korean BBQ is cool but Japanese BBQ is fire.' u"So far I'm still waiting. They told us 45 minutes.. it has been 50 \xa0and they said we been here for only 20 minutes. Thats a lie. I looked at the time when we sat down in the waiting area. Hopefully the food is worth it.Well the food was great. For two people we spent 101 dollars. Duck meat. Pork belly. Spicy pork and tori beef. All of them were great. The servers were great and then food came really fast except for the rice. The shrimp dumplings were not as amazing as everyone said. Probably because they were cold. Besides that everything else was hot. Great experience besides the wait. So you have been warned. Make a reservation!" u'I go to this Gyu Kaku location more than the other two combined. They have a large selection of meats to choose from that are very much well priced. Lunch combos and happy hour pricing makes it an extremely affordable option for meat lovers like myself. Getting copious amounts of meat plus really good appetizers and drinks for half off during happy hour makes my stomach heart and wallet very happy. Make a reservation if you can! If not you might have to wait a bit as they do get pretty busy.' u"My girlfriend had gone to the gyukaku in Mass and since she signed up and got a welcome offer to this place she recommended us to try out the midtown location when we were out with my buddy.Gyu kaku did not disappoint. For happy hour we got a couple beers a bunch of meat including the beef tongue skirt steak and pork belly a vegetable platter and a mushroom platter two orders of the sukiyaki bibimbap the garlic fried rice the volcano tuna app the tuna tataki app some lettuce for wrapping kimchi and some sauces sesame salt and garlic something. The sesame and salt sauce wasn't necessary since the spicy sauce there was already delicious but the sauce really did make things more enjoyable. The lettuce wrap follows similar logic. The garlic sauce though was a disappointment. Of the food stuff we ordered the meat was all delicious and the rices were all great but the portions were a bit small. We had to order another two things of rice and a couple more apps just to get there. The mushroom platter was delicious and had enoki mushroom in it which made my day. The apps and the other veggie platter I could've done without but meh we wanted to try some new stuff. As far as the service here the wait staff took forever just to get us our lettuce when we ran out mid meal during which the meat got cold. The uncooked meats also took forever to come out of the kitchen. I don't quite get that which is part of the reason I docked a point. The other was the price. Even during happy hour the prices came out comparable to a dinner elsewhere simply because the portions were so small. My girlfriend thought we'd get a good meal at a good price during happy hour but our total for the 3 of us came out to $110 before tip. Overall food was good. Service (or kitchen response time really) was lackluster. Would definitely not come back outside of happy hour (which luckily is almost all the time). Due to the price though I might just go elsewhere." u"Really really good. For Korean BBQ/Yakiniku in Manhattan the pricing is not that bad. It's priced per plate. Of course the premium items like Kobe/Wagyu are going to cost you a lot more but for the most part it's really reasonably priced.I usually come during Happy Hour and/or Lunch Specials. The lunch specials come with rice soup salad and (I get) your choice of three plates of meat. Happy Hour drink specials are awesome. They have great deals on drinks and beer. I also recommend you get the sukiyaki bibimbap. Really good addition to the BBQ. As far as meats get the Miso Hanger Steak or the Harami Skirt Steak. They also have a few sauces I always use the spicy one to dip my meat in I suggest you do too it's pretty bomb.Staff is really friendly too. Always say hi to you when you walk in and they always check up on you making sure you're having a good time. For lunch it's surprisingly not as busy considering it's only a stone's throw from Times Square and right near a lot of the Broadway Theatres and hotels. Evening happy hours tend to get pretty busy. But it's not a consistent busy. I've come here before with a waiting time of upwards half an hour. Other times I'll be seated immediately. Same time different Tuesdays."]
59.Amarone Restaurant,[u'We decided to eat here before seeing the play Wicked. It was a great choice. Although not a large restaurant it makes for it with nice Italian dishes and prompt service. I had the black linguini with mixed seafood. There was nothing left on plate when I finished it. When I asked for crushed red paper they brought me a house special - pepper-infused olive oil - WOW. I just needed a few drops of this stuff to add incredible flavor.I enojoy Amarone wine. Majority of restaurants sell by the bottle only which can quite expensive. This place sells it by the glass. I had a glass to treat myself.' u"This review is being written with my sister-in-law for whom English is a second language. \xa0My sister-in-law ate at Amarone on Saturday June 4 at 9 pm. \xa0Throughout the evening the weather had been stormy and unpredictable which made my sister-in-law feel like she was getting a cold. \xa0As such she wasn't very hungry and decided to order a simple salad at Amarone. \xa0The waitress was rude and insisted that she order a second dish. \xa0When my sister-in-law declined the waitress brought the dish out anyway forcing my sister-in-law to decline the dish a second time. \xa0The waitress later had the gall to put a mandatory tip on the bill - even though the dinner was only for two people. \xa0My sister-in-law felt the waitress was particular rude perhaps because English was not her first language. \xa0Yes folks the waitress in NYC of all places seemed to discriminate against a non-English speaking patron. \xa0Absolutely ridiculous." u'Very friendly; took us in late after a show. Amazing Italian food. Cute place relaxing atmosphere. Would love to go again when I return to New York :)' u'This place was recommended by our concierge when I lamented the terrible food in the Times Square area. \xa0And wow did she point us on the right direction! \xa0The gnocchi is handmade with just the right touch and the shellfish is cooked just the right amount not a second over- or undercooked so rare these days except in the most nosebleed-high-priced restaurants in the world. \xa0They make everything from scratch and it shows. \xa0A strong recommendation to go to this one.' u"Just returned from a wonderful dinner at Amarone. The owner Tony was so welcoming and gracious. The grilled calamari was delicious! My husband enjoyed his Branzino and I had Chicken Amarone....delicious! A true gem! Can't wait to go back and enjoy it with friends. Perfect location in the theatre district!" u"Took a friend for dinner for his birthday and towards the end saw cockroaches. The waiter stamped the cockroach in front of us. When I called for the Manager he was busy talking on the phone and didn't feel it was a big deal. I wasn't offered to be reimbursed or compensated and left a bad taste for a $100 meal. I am also going making a complain to the sanitation department.Thanks" u'Wonderful bustling restaurant that will get you to the theater in time with a belly full of delicious Italian fare! \xa0We had a reservation at 6 pm with tickets to Kinky Boots at 8 pm: \xa0We had all three courses aperitif and wine.....and we got out with an hour to spare!Our party of three was seated in an awkward corner up against the pepper mills and condiments. \xa0The restaurant was packed with large parties (6 8 14!) and the tables were pretty tight and the din was LOUD!Everything else was exceptional: \xa0The service! \xa0The Burrata! The Chicken Parm! \xa0The Sea Bass! \xa0The Pasta! \xa0and ....of course the Cheesecake. \xa0We tried Kir Amarones as aperitifs- bellisimo! I would absolutely come here again!' u"This place has great food! \xa0I can't eat tomatoes so I panicked a bit when I noticed that most dishes had tomatoes. They were very nice and offered to make any pasta dish with an Alfredo sauce for me. I had gnocchi with chicken and an Alfredo sauce. It was delicious! \xa0My husband had the salmon. The filet was huge!One piece of advice- give your food a minute to cool before eating. They serve their food piping hot!" u'I was looking for a spot with no wait after a Broadway show and this was the spot on a Saturday night for just that and good food! I had the rigatoni and eggplant fritters which were both amazing! Friendly staff and nice ambiance. Portions were also just right.' u'I enjoyed this place but without a reservation we got stuffed into the corner. I guess we should have anticipated that we would need a reservation in this location.The food was good nothing especially special about it. It was reasonably priced and the service was attentive.' u"One of our favorites when we visit NYC. It is more of a local's place than a tourist trap. Nice people fair prices and good food. A good combo in an area full of high priced tourist traps.We have been going here for years and look forward to our next visit!" u"I took my wife here on a date for dinnet. This place was amazing. The food was excellent - I had the fettuccine in squid ink with shrimp Nd mussles my wife had the gnocchi. The service of the wait staff was exceptional and the ambiance was very enjoyable. We almost didn't go on because it looked a little empty. Don't let that fool you. This gets five stars." u'Good food good fast service. I would recommend this place for anyone craving for Italian food.' u'Great food excellent wait staff. Short walking distance from Times Square which was handy' u"With the myriad of Italian restaurants in the Theater/Hell's Kitchen area an establishment's food must be up to par to survive the competition. Amarone's is just that. Up to par. It's a small place but not cramped. The host was a delightful gentleman who seated us promptly during the pre-theater rush. Our meals came out quicker than we expected. All good signs. The food was just ok. The chicken parmesan though somewhat tasty was a bit over-cooked with minimal sauce and cheese. Their (shrimp) Gamberoni was much better but slightly under-seasoned for our palate. Not bad food...just ok. If you're looking for a descent Italian spot with swift service add this to your choices...but be sure to have a reservation during pre-theater times." u"It's a mixed review for Amarone because while my entree came up a little short others in the group did not have that problem and they made up for it on the excellent desert. The establishment itself could use improved lighting. They have a good selection of wine here and knowledgeable staff. I had chicken parm for dinner. The pasta was really good and cooked perfectly. Sauce was okay but the chicken itself came up a bit short on texture and the breading seemed a bit too soggy on it. Tiramisu for desert was excellent though. They are reasonably priced for Manhattan too." u'this has been a favorite for many years. Tony is the most fantastic host and of course gentleman.The Veal Chop is the move here.' u"I decided to try this place out due to the great Yelp reviews. \xa0There is some weird stuff going on because this is a Mc'Dees for Italian fare at best. \xa0First as soon as you enter it smells like bad breath. \xa0If you're a host have a stick of gum!The wine choices were not more then a range of types not named bottles. The staff was not knowledgeable about the wines and the quality of wine was only good if you're underage and in a frat house. \xa0The staff was nice. The food was not. \xa0Our dinner arrived 2 minutes after ordering and it was room temperature! Not impressed by the Gnocci or the Spinach Ravioli they had as the days special. \xa0Like I said Mc'Dees for Italian food. The Chocolate cake with Hazelnut Gelato was eh. \xa0Nothing special and I will not be back to this place. \xa0Do Not Waste Your Money here!" u'Gluten free pasta was very good with puttenesca as was the beet salad and branzino. Caesar salad very good but on the skimpy side. Service was great friendly and informative. Very pleasant place to dine.' u"I've been to Amarone a couple of times now - and it does not disappoint. I was trying to decide between the gnocchi and orechietta and Kesha recommended the orechietta. They were delightful with the smoked mozzarella. On my return trip I tried the gnocchi. Also good. The salad was decent but nothing to write home about. Dessert however was top notch. The tiramisu was excellent - not overly sweet but sweet enough. And the whipped cream on the side adds some sweetness if you're craving it. Tasty grappa as a digestive too.Wine was good both times trying the house Amarone once and the d'olcetto d'alba. Smooth and reasonably priced (the Amarone was pricy but that's expected). What makes the experience is the service. Kesha served me at the bar both trips and she was friendly and helpful. My second trip the owner Tony talked to me for a good half hour or more. It was like talking to a friend after only a little while. Food kids family travel - it was great to have a conversation while traveling alone."]
117.Feinstein’s/54 Below,[u"AMAZING!!!! Oh and if your into Broadway - this is a great networking spot! Of course it's a supper club it's pricey it's New York! It's pricey! Just enjoy yourself! And don't forget to stand up and dance on the last song! You have one night only!!!" u'Overpriced overcrowded and overrated. Well let\'s first mention the positive. The decor is amazing. It\'s got that upmarket speak easy feel. {Warning: it\'s not well sign posted and the red door is discrete so it\'s easy to walk pass and miss we nearly did}. However the place is crammed. You will feel like a sardine in a can. Your feet will cramp as there\'s only one place to put them. Whilst you eat your elbows will collide with your neighbours. None of us were obese. All this despite paying $80 for "premium" seating. Expect far tighter conditions if you opt standard seating and/or you\'re seating near a fat person. Best of luck there. The service was excellent the food. It\'s highly priced and dull. A mere lemonade cost $9.00 plus tax. I endured a bland unseasoned guacamole simply pureed avocado. I never thought a chef could mess that up. The plantain chip were greasy and Flavourless. The crowd is and enthusiastic. The performance is intimate and friendly. However despite the high cost you barely get an hour. Avoid.' u"I have to say this was a pretty sweet place. Great atmosphere and great food. I got the steak and although I wish it was bigger it tasted so good with the onion rings and thinly slided potatoes with brussel sprouts. It tasted quite healthy. I wasn't too fond of the cheesecake but my coworkers all loved it. That's probably because I don't like cheesecake to begin with. It was topped with apples and an apple crisp was embedded into the whipped cream. The appetizer was a squash soup which was delicious expecially paired with that awesome bread. Beautiful place and great waitstaff." u'My friends and I got tickets to see a musical comedy about "Murder She Wrote." We bought the ringside seats which are right up against the stage. My only complaint is that I had to stare straight up to see the actors who were close to the edge of the stage. Otherwise it was obvious that Feinstein\'s/54 Below has their thing down to a science.All our food came out quickly and everything was delicious. I\'m not someone who thinks about food being pretty but in addition to tasting great it also looked great. The performance was so much fun and when it was over the check was already on our table. I didn\'t even see the waitress bring it. It was like magic!I would totally go see another show at Feinstein\'s/54 Below but knowing how cozy the space is I doubt that I would need to get the seats right at the stage.' u"Loved it! Starting with the nicest bouncer I ever met who brought us hot cider while we waited for our show. Then it was into the beautiful room. Every seat is good and our waiter was personable \xa0and charming. In fact everyone who worked there was very nice. We really liked the food and the entertainment is world-class. It's kind of fancy so dress nice; no blue jeans please. It's sophisticated NY glamour and I can't wait to go back." u"Decent food but pricey.The wines are criminally overpriced. \xa0 I'm fully aware that restaurants do a huge markup on liquor but to charge $18.00 a glass from a bottle that I can get for $14.99 seems absurd.Waiters are snippy too." u'The seating has changed since my last visit. \xa0There are still 2 long tables but quite a few tables that seat 4 the closest are called "ringside" which is where I sat. Some of the ringside are right up against the stage and I requested not to be in those seats. \xa0They honored my requests (you can make a request when you book). You pay the seating price by area with no guarantee on which table and if you have less than 4 in your party you will likely be sharing it. \xa0There are also some booths that are around the edges and some are elevated. \xa0There is also bar seating. \xa0Almost every seat has a pretty good view though. \xa0We opted to have dinner there (there is a $25.00 minimum any way). \xa0Prices are a bit high but the food was excellent. \xa0They offer a prix fixe menu for $64.00 that has 3 courses. \xa0The items on the prix fixe can also be ordered ala carte. \xa0I had the scallops which were cooked just right and tasted great. \xa0My salad and dessert were also very good. \xa0They offer a discount on parking if you are driving. \xa0My friend and I saw Lea Salonga who was wonderful. \xa0It\'s an intimate setting with great talent and great food. \xa0It is worth going back again and again. \xa0If you go frequently you can become a member for $100.00 which will get you discounts and some other perks.' u"Intimate and classy place to watch some top rated performers sing. Manhattan's own supper club. I like this venue. Decorated with archival pictures from the 20's it feels more like classic night club tucked away. Hence the name 54 Below. I get the feeling when a singer performs here it will catapult him/her into a larger spotlight. The setting feels a bit small and some may say it feels a bit cramped. But it allows you to talk with others around you. The acoustics sound great. It allows the performer to interact directly with the audience. The food tasted good. I ordered the king salmon. It melted in my mouth! Loved the taste!" u"I had a great experience going here. A cabaret below the iconic Studio 54 as you descend down the steps it's like entering another era. Ever detail from the wall paper to the molding to the art around the place takes me back in history to images of speakeasies and supper clubs I've only seen in movies. The room was well organized with a central stage and pretty good views all around.The performance obviously makes the show. We saw Carole Bufford's show Heart of Gold: A Portrait of the World's Oldest Profession. Amazing! The numbers she sung arrangements transitions the show featured songs over the last century regarding Women of the night trial and tribulations infatuation etc. The food was great. I had an espresso marinated steak and my wife had grilled salmon. We didn't drink but the drinks looked good too. There's aMinimum charge with each performance that was $25 per person. Great place. Highly recommend. Check out my pics." u"On my list of places to go next time I'm in NYC!!My mom and I happened upon 54 Below looking for a pre-theater drink. If we hadn't had tickets to see the amazing Caberet upstairs...we'd have stayed here! \xa0In fact we almost went back after Caberet to see the late show.The music at the live show was amazing and - as another yelper wrote - you get to see Broadway names up close! \xa0I can't wait to go back!!" u"I could write for days about the fabulous cabarets here - I've seen so many! \xa0But I really just want to rave about their mac n cheese! \xa0I am OBSESSED with their mac n cheese. \xa0I'm not sure at this point if I go for the entertainment or the mac n cheese! \xa0YUM!Also I've tried several of their cocktails. \xa0Light and refreshing. \xa0Their bar tender is great.Because the mac n cheese and cocktails are so yummy I never feel inconvenienced by the food drink minimum. But really it's just a great evening out. \xa0Every show I've seen there has been great. \xa0Staff always upbeat and helpful and respectful and smiling. \xa0It's everything you want in a cabaret/dining experience." u"Booked a premium table for my wife's birthday and it was better than I could have hoped.We saw Michael Feinstein and he was outstanding! \xa0Great stories and an excellent voice!We ate dinner at another restaurant prior so we just had fries and drinks but it was a great experience and we look forward to coming back!Thank you to the friendly staff and phenomenal performance!" u"This is an upscale intimate location with some top-notch performances and some excellent food - but it's certainly not a cheap venue. The cover/tickets for the shows I've been to have averaged about $40... About $20 for your average appetizer... $30 or so for an entree.. $15 for a dessert. I mean it's not absurd or anything... just not gentle on the wallet. But it's great for a date!Additionally the staff was absolutely lovely." u"This is a excellent intimate live music venue. Acoustics are very good and there is a pretty good lighting system as well.The majority of the seating is at long tables pointed toward the stage so some seats tend to be faced away from the performer and those seated in the first few slots (and I do mean slots) may find the lighting in their eyes. A few booths along the back provide the most comfortable seating.Food is adequate. The french fries were excellent and the Caesar salad was fresh. The ratatouille shepherd's pie was a bit disappointing. There's a nice selection of moderately priced wines.Service is friendly and unobtrusive." u'Feels like you travelled to another era in here! Came to hear my friend sing. Really good acoustics. Staff is super nice. \xa0Cute place for a date or a good place to take your mom which is what I did.' u"54 Below is a slightly more upscale version of Joe's Pub (which is still my favorite spot in Manhattan.) The space is absolutely gorgeous and the food is great. Here you can get a Hanger Steak rather than a Hamburger. Of course it will cost you ($25 minimum.) There is not a bad seat in the house. All of the seats are no more than 24 feet from the stage. The sound and lighting is also top notch.Bottom line if you are a fan of Broadway or cabaret entertainment this is the place for you. If you are looking for a classy place to take a date this is for you. If you are just tired of sitting in your apartment eating Chinese take-out for the third time in a week and have the need to go out and feel fancy-shmancy this is the place for you.Go ahead treat yourself." u"Last night was my first time at this venue and I loved it. \xa0From the moment I got on the line outside to enter (the last show hadn't let out yet) to the ease of checking in to a hostess ready immediately to take me to my table to my waiter (Danny who was wonderful) at my table ASAP with water a greeting and taking my first order it all flowed very nicely. \xa0I love the space. \xa0It's such a nice intimate venue. \xa0A friend was performing in the staff show and so I went and I'm so glad I did. \xa0It was such a nice night out. \xa0My meal was a 5 star. \xa0The food was really good and I didn't expect that. \xa0The show which was made up of all of the staff members singing songs was so much fun. \xa0There are some extremely talented and fun loving staff there. \xa0My review is go! \xa0Sure you'll spend about $100 but who cares. \xa0It's one night and it's a great time." u"Pretty cool spot that hosts tons of live shows and events. \xa0I came here to see the preview of Comfort Women: A New Musical and it was great! \xa0It'll be coming out off-Broadway this July!And yes you do have a $20 minimum food/drink order per person and that food comes out fast!! \xa0I had their bacon mac 'n cheese yucca fries plantains with guacamole...and our friends had their burgers. \xa0They were all pretty decent!" u"LOVED LOVED LOVED this place!! Bought tickets on travelzoo and emailed the company for reservations to the show for Carter Calvert. She was an amazing talent and the food was awesome! The lighting and d\xe9cor was astounding and the sounds were elite! Only drawbacks: The red-head hostess tried to give us a problem on the way in citing that we'd have to buy extra tickets for admission since we made reservations only 3 & 1 day in advance rather than 5 but we were told over the phone that this would be no problem. The manager okayed our presence and provided us with a bottle of the house wine to make up for it. The truffle mac & cheese was to die for." u'Great place to see BRDWY names up close. You may or may not be familiar with the entertainer but that doesn\'t matter. It\'s Broadway and they\'re all good. The food was fine. I can\'t recall what I ate. We were just excited because the cellist from Jason Robert Brown\'s "Bridges of Madison...." sat at our table. Afterward at bar the entertainer stays for a bit to chat. If you prefer to not pay the top price you can always sit at the bar for the dinner and show. If they\'re not sold out you may even get a free upgrade.']
17.Joe Allen,[u"My wife and I always make this our after-theater dinner spot. We've been multiple times and can't say enough good things about the food the service and the atmosphere. You also might see a Broadway star or two relaxing with a drink after a show.Our favorites include the meatloaf with mashed potatoes the fish and chips and the banana cream pie. The french dip is great also." u'Had lunch here before Hamilton last Wednesday! Really really nice place! Food was delicious.....prices were very reasonable! Our waiter was a quite arrogant. NOT wild about his attitude. We had a 12noon reservation. We were finished by 12:25. I realize they are trying to get food out very quickly to 2pm theater patrons but we felt very rushed. We had to order coffee dessert AND a coffee refill just to slow down a bit and enjoy it! Would absolutely come back here mainly because of its proximity to the theaters and the food really was good! However we would insist on them slowing down next time before we even placed our order!' u'One of New York\'s most Iconic restaurants-Joe AllenVisiting New York would never be complete without strolling down Shubert alley and watching the thousands of theater goers visit the fabulous theaters. The noise the music the smells of new york are like no other. One of the other great attractions are the amazing diverse restaurants around the theater district. Joe Allen is certainly a throwback to the glory days of the eighties with old world decor and a celebrity crowd.We were in luck this past weekend as we were with our broadway producer relative. We walked into the restaurant and were immediately seated at a prime table in the center of the dining room. Joe Allen features as part of its decor hundreds of colorful posters from broadway shows that didn\'t survive. We decided to try the famed Joe Allen Burger with curly cheese fries. The Burger certainly deserves a place in the pantheon of "most fabulous New York burgers"Topped with a thick layer of swiss cheese it was simply amazingly delicious!Loved the burger fries the broadway ambiance and the wonderful wait staff. Dining at Joe Allen and rubbing shoulders with well known actors directors producers and celebrities made the evening that much more awesome!A great place to dine before or after a show.' u"This quickly became \xa0my favorite little neighborhood restaurant in NYC. There are fancier places but not as warm and comfortable. I almost wish I could find a reason to give them a bad review because I don't want it to get any more crowded lol. The liver plate is simply the best I have ever had. I needed up addicted and eating there almost every night I was in town and I lost weight because the food has quality ingredients and it is so satisfying. The bar tender worked hard to find a wine I could drink with my sulfate allergy. I settled on their house Pinot and I felt perfect. I can't wait to go back for liver next week." u"This was a revisit after two years and last time I tried their dinner so decided to give a try on their brunch.Apparently they were just opening up when my friend and I got there however they still welcomed us warmly! A selection of brunch items were offered and we chose salmon with scrambled egg (with muffin) and Cajun chicken sandwich. The fries accompanied the chicken sandwich was so crispy! Only thing was that they do not offer skim milk here so I settled myself with whole milk.I'd love to come back given the amid ambience and delicious food. There are just so many good restaurant around this neighborhood and I felt so lucky!" u"Absolutely loved this place. It is a little hard to find if you didn't know it was there. We stopped in just passing by and were lucky enough to grab a table. I had the lobster and crab roll and it was absolutely delicious. I am not usually a lobster fan but the mixture was great. My husband ordered the burger off several other Recommendations. It was great juicy but not greasy. The atmosphere and staff were fantastic I have already suggested this to other friends." u'Best bacon cheeseburger and fries! Great atmosphere very cool pictures. Excellent wait staff Will is the best!' u"This place made my top picks list in the city! Great atmosphere and keep an eye out for the stars who frequently visit the dining room. I tend to be a steak guy but I was looking for something a little lighter and went with the chicken at the waiters (who were fantastic!) recommendation. Let me tell you implore you advise you beg you...get the chicken!! You will not be disappointed!!! The roasted cauliflower is an excellent side and if you are a lover of anchovies (as I am) get them on the side with your Cesar salad..yum! Don't forget to get a reservation this place is a theatre district institution so it fills up fast! The staff treated me like a vip every night they were outstanding!!" u"Great post theater meal -- had the rigatoni (homemade noodles and the tomato sauce was really flavorful). Combined with the Caesar salad. BTW had guacamole to start (don't ask why!) but really enjoyed it \xa0great flavors and I liked the option of lettuce leaves with the chips. Nice service (and we were pushing closing time). Will visit again..." u'15 dollars for guacamole not sure it was that great. \xa0Chicken was tasty. Overall was disappointed after we left.' u"I've had so many disappointing meals around the NYC theater district and now I can add Joe Allen to the list.The service was slow and the waitress seemed uninterested. The wings tasted like heated up frozen food. The meatloaf dish was just average as well as the pasta. Nothing interesting for dessert. And the tiny cramped bathroom is not a nice experience either.This is another restaurant living off it's prime location. Sigh..." u'I\'ve been here twice in the past few weeks. \xa0The first time a good friend took me here and it was great good food and wine excellent service a great experience overall. \xa0That first experience is the only thing keeping this review from being one star. \xa0My second visit with some girlfriends this past Saturday evening around 8pm was a huge letdown. \xa0They told us when they sat us that they had a reservation for that table after us we said we that was okay we didn\'t plan to linger.On my previous visit the waiter was friendly and polite and gave us detailed descriptions of some of the highlights of their frequently changing menu. \xa0This time our waiter was markedly unpleasant. \xa0I asked it there were any specials since I had been enticed by them last time and received a very snippy "It\'s all on the menu" \xa0as he apparently couldn\'t be bothered to describe their dishes. At one point he brought bread to the table and told my friends and I to "try not to make a mess." \xa0We all heard him and it was so rude and unexpected we were all shaking out heads wondering what this guy\'s problem was. \xa0My only guess is the guy was worried about flipping the table quickly in time for the next reservation. \xa0I get it this is New York rent is high flipping tables fast is important and no one likes to arrive and hear their table isn\'t ready. \xa0But that\'s no excuse for being rude to the paying customers you agreed to seat. \xa0Thankfully midtown is full of dining options. \xa0I work in the area and take friends and business associates out in midtown on a regular basis. \xa0I will take my business elsewhere in the future.' u"After going to see an awesome Penn & Teller show while in NY for the weekend we stopped at Joe Allen for a meal. While this restaurant is in the theater district on restaurant row it was disappointing. I am used to going to NYC at least once a month to catch a show and went with my bf for what we had hoped would be a good meal. We were both disappointed. From the time we entered the restaurant until the time we left I thought that we were invisible. The host took his time in seating us and then the waitress took her time to take our order after we arrived at the table. The appetizer which was buffalo wings were bland in warm. I had a pasta dish which was not very flavorful. The pasta had shrimp in it and I could count with one hand the number of shrimp in the dish. This place is a place that I will never visit again. If the food is being given out for free you won't find me in that line. I have had so much better at several restaurants on restaurant row." u'See my tip. \xa0An absolute must if you are in the area wanting to dine. \xa0The prices are very reasonable and everything was heavenly. \xa0The portions are very good size. \xa0Not a very kid friendly place to come but very cozy and quaint. \xa0 I will definitely return of I am on the area.' u'Always the best service! \xa0 Every meal delicious! \xa0 The Staff knows how to deliver perfect service while getting you to a show on time! \xa0 (Everything)' u'Had the best brisket sandwich ever with dipping sauce..a few other ingredients that suprised me..great bloody mary too' u'Looking for a late dinner after our play let out I found Joe Allen on Yelp while waiting for the play to start. Nearby open late good Yelp reviews and they take Open Table online reservations. Booked a 9:45 pm made it over a few minutes early. \xa0Nice place larger inside than it looks from the street. \xa0Food: Interesting menu with diverse choices. You\'ll find Tofu next to Meatloaf and liver. We ended up ordering the Lobster/Crab roll Pan Roasted Sea Scallops and the Calf Liver. Now I don\'t eat liver often I can usually take it or leave it but our server said it was very popular here. Who am I to argue so I order the Liver I\'m taken aback when he asked how would like it done. I\'ve only had liver prepared one way..breaded and fried till the inside is dry as a bone. Never knew you could prepare it medium or medium rare..went with Medium as I can\'t even image a medium rare liver. Food doesn\'t take long to get the table. Scallops are seared nicely and served on a bed of quinoa. The lobster/crab roll has a generous portion served on grilled bread with a house made chips. Now my liver..sliced thin covered in a rich demi glace next to mashed potatoes and steamed spinach. Interesting..not breaded and not fried. I cut off a piece the first thing you taste is the sauce. Rich slightly sweet perfectly balanced. Then texture of the liver not mealy when you get a thick piece cooked past well done. This texture was soft creamy but there is still a slight snap to the meat. Finishes with a taste that lets says "Hello remember me you\'re eating liver". A little bitter aftertaste that lingers for a few seconds you definitely know what you are eating. You get two large thin slices so it\'s a good sized portion. \xa0Would I order it again if I were to eat here in the future..probably not but I am not sorry that I tried it this time. It\'s just that there were other interesting things I\'d want to try here. Oh..and the bartender makes and excellent Manhattan which I guess a bartender would have to master working in Manhattan. Service: Good service our waiter was wonderful offered us recommendations saw to and met all of our dining needs. \xa0All of the staff we interacted with were energetic (this was after 10 pm) and friendly.Atmosphere: Nice place interior was relaxing but that was past 10 pm so I\'m not sure how it is earlier in the evening. One thing I noticed..that had to be one of the smallest men\'s room I\'ve been in! Clean so I guess I\'d choose clean and tiny versus filthy and huge..it\'s just a very small space!Value: It\'s near Times Square so you know it\'ll be on the pricier side. In line with other establishments the cocktail prices are reasonable. Overall: I\'d come back to try their brisket sandwich or meatloaf next time. A good place that\'s a perfect place for a late dinner or dessert after a show.' u"The La Scala salad is fabulous. \xa0I highly recommend it and the prices are \xa0great. Most expensive item is $25. Great value. You need reservations but we managed to get in.I didn't see any kids in the place and this includes teenagers. There you have it." u'Classy place.the staff is very nice and pro.They have a very nice dining room candle light quiet and romantic.The food is good well cooked but a little over priced.I gues they make you pay more for the location of the restaurant and because of the classy atmosphere.the burger is tasty and big it is the only thing I had the chance to try everything else was a little too pricey.The experience was very nice but I would go back there not for the food but only for the romantic place.' u'I came here for the second time last night before seeing a show and had good experiences both times. We walked in without a reservation and were seated immediately. We had a pasta dish the Cajun chicken sandwich and the grilled chicken entree all of which were delicious. This is definitely a great spot to come enjoy some cocktails and dinner before seeing a Broadway show.']
68.Toasties,[u"I would have given 5 stars but the customer service was lacking.The espresso machine was not working.They want you to talk to them in NY lingo if you don't know the keywords they are looking for you are in for a lot of back and forth for your order.The cashier seems to be least interested in the job.The food on the other hand was pretty good. Omelette platter and french toasts were nice." u'the worst delivery system i have ever witnessed! i ordered delivery from them 4 different times and they either get my order wrong sent me an opened orange juice and sent my order to another location leaving me without food for 2 hours! pathetic. shut this place down or change management quickly.' u'I came here the first time just a couple of minutes before it was closed on a weekend day and I was turned away as the staff was already cleaning up and heading home.When I returned the following morning I decided to go with a breakfast sandwich with ham and egg. The sandwich was decent but nothing to go across town for. That being said the sandwich was prepared pretty quickly and was priced reasonably.Overall this place has a decent product but the service is spotty and it can be hard to find a place to sit at times.' u'We just came in for a quick bite before headed to see Finding Neverland.The food was average.The wait staff average.I felt it was a little over priced.' u"They have a lot of great options and aren't too pricey! My friend and I just needed a quick breakfast before heading in line to the TKTS booth to get our broadway fix in for the day. We both got a Saturday Morning but instead of a wrap we got it on a bagel. I love having that option for a nice bagel sandwich in the morning!It was pretty cheap since it was only about $6 but still filled me up for a quick meal. The homefries in the sandwich is such a good touch and completes the typical brunch flavors you get from the eggs cheese and bacon. The salsa they put on the side is actually really good too! It has a little spicy kick to it and pairs well with the taste of the eggs and fries." u"Good average bagel nothing over the top. I gave a 3 mainly because I was expecting the bagel to be a little softer than it was. It was a little too hard (not crispy from the toaster rather hard). My wife's bagel had amazing ingredients as you see in the picture. Her bagel was about $10. My plain sesame was priced well at about $3." u'Love this place!Deli with SO many options. Great for breakfast or lunch. I got a bacon egg cheese avocado on a roll.Not too pricey (a little under $6) and DELISH.Wish it was closer to my office I would definitely come by more often.' u'Found this place on Yelp near where we were staying and ordered a couple of breakfast sandwiches for breakfast. \xa0Great decision! \xa0My wife and I both thought they were delicious and price was reasonable. \xa0Highly recommend for a quick breakfast on the go.' u'This place should be used as a case study on efficient operations. It\'s located steps from the offices of a few big banks so during the lunch rush expect an army of suits (I\'m often one of them). It\'s always PACKED. That said I can\'t ever recall getting in and out in more than 10 minutes. "Well-oiled machine" is an understatement. The people behind the counter are pros. The sandwiches are great too. I usually get the Caspar which among other things has avocado hummus and turkey breast. It sounds odd but it\'s a great combination.' u'Everything looks so fresh and tastes the same Minimal seating as always in NYC.Lox are delish and not fishy or discolored.' u"Stopped in on a Friday at 1PM. It wasn't too crowd and lines were moving efficiently. The order-line guy was accommodating to my tweaks of a 'specialty' sandwich - the Popeye (Grilled chicken breast melted fresh Mozzarella cheese spinach alfalfa sprouts roasted red peppers shredded red cabbage romaine - normally with honey mustard but I opted for balsamic vinegar and spicy mustard). \xa0Paying was quick sandwich was made pretty promptly and it was a pretty delicious sandwich. \xa0Good times will be back." u"Visiting NY for the second time and came across this place because it has great reviews and it was close to my hotel. It was 7:00am and already packed with people on their way to work. Honestly the bagels were just ok. Definitely not worth it. The day before we went to the Best Bagels (I think that's what it's called) and it was 100 times better!" u"Place was great  my girlfriend and I stopped for breakfast based upon the other Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint ! \xa0 \xa0We had a breakfast sandwich and omelet and they came with free coffee. \xa0Price was right  quick turn around and good food. \xa0 We didn't get pizza but it looked really good. \xa0 Would recommend !" u"I'm not a local but I do have a love for bagels. I don't know what the New York standard for bagels is but I really enjoyed mine! I got a plain bagel with scallion cream cheese and it was SO good. In fact I'm going back tomorrow for breakfast so I can try another flavor of cream cheese!My husband ordered a bagel breakfast sandwich and really enjoyed his as well. And prices here are great two we only spent $9 on a bagel with cc a breakfast sandwich and a coffee!This location was clean quick and friendly." u'Great breakfast spot. Super quick to get our food. Limiting seating but because of the quick turn around people are always in and out. As a visitor it was cool to see it not only a spot for us but also a local favorite. We went at 10 am and still got our food a good time. I highly recommend this spot and will be back for sure.' u"In terms of the food this place is great! Nothing to complain about. However the reason I gave this place a three out of five was due to the service. The Hispanic lady over the counter with the dark brown hair was rude. All my fiancee and I did was asked for a cup of water and she started giving us an attitude. Hey rude lady something might be going on in your life but don't take it out on the customers go see a therapist or something." u'Took 25 minutes for a bagel and cream cheese. Thanks for toasting it in advance so that it was dried out and cold by the time I got it"You see you know how to take the reservation you just don\'t know how to hold the reservation."' u"It's a great spot for a quick breakfast. We went on a Saturday morning and was able to find a table. Customers service was good. The food was great as well as the coffee. \xa0You also can't beat the prices!" u'I have eaten there three times for breakfast. \xa0Good food and fast. \xa0The staff is friendly. \xa0I family love their breakfast sandwiches as well. \xa0The healthy wrap has good taste. \xa0We also had the coffee and ice tea. \xa0The were both fine and a little above average.' u"Really good for bagel sandwich I think it's better than bagel and coffee. And it's also cheaper and short lines. So good I ate 2 breakfast bagel with sausage and egg and cheese. If u want a bagel go here its awesome. Really hot and fresh"]
34.Mentoku,[u"Oh boy! What a wonderful little place. Based on one bowl of ramen I would definitely come here again.I got the Hakata Tonkichi Ramen. Don't expect your fancy-newyork-hipster-experimental-organic-fusion-aioli-kale-hybrid-mitsubishi ramen. It's a bowl of extremely satisfying hearty broth one or two toppings and some thin slices of pork. The noodles are very similar to Ippudo (thin almost 'al-dente') but the 'pureness' all comes together very harmoniously. Friendly staff nice clean restaurant excellent for when you just want something filling and simple." u'Average ramen place and I am not a big fan of its Matcha Ramen. Too bold of a choice... The soup was plain and the meat (maybe?) tastes absurd. I may give this place another try and just order the more regular ramen dish.' u"This is now my favorite ramen joint. Ever since becoming vegetarian I have really struggled to find ramen that is both tasty and not overly salty but oh does this place hit the spot. Matcha ramen may sound a bit weird at first but it honestly is just the right amount of matcha and savoriness. The flavor of the matcha is strong with the first few sips but mellows out as you eat more of it. The noodles are perfectly firm and I love the sweet tofu that it comes it. Hands down the best vegetarian ramen (if not the best ramen) I've had so far. The meat eaters I have come here with have also enjoyed the other ramens as well. They also have some really affordable lunch options where you can get ramen with a rice dish or salad on the side. I will definitely be coming back soon!Tip: Like many other ramen places this spot is cash only." u"We decided to try the Matcha Ramen (really wanted to try Spicy Whipped Cream Ramen as well but gave up the idea because I don't wanna get too fat LOL). We also ordered Edamame Cheese Senbei and Karaage (fried chicken).Do not recommend the Edamame cheese Senbei. It's so-so taste and totally not worth the $5. Basically it's just fried provolone (I guess) cheese with some edamame beans in the middle. \xa0You can make it by yourself at home with no effort. The fried chicken is big chunk juicy tender meet but nothing so special about it after all.The matcha ramen is mild and has subtle matcha flavor in the soup that is not thick and heavy. The noodles were thin style noodles but to me they were a little overcooked and too soft. It may sound weird to put matcha powder in ramen but it tastes just like other normal veggie ramen except that the soup is green.FYI if you wanna go with the lunch set the Match ramen set will be $13 with a rice (3 or 4 options to choose) and either a side salad or Kaedama (an extra portion of noodles). Also on the menu there is a pic showing a combination of both Matcha ramen and the Spicy whipped cream ramen. HOWEVER it's not a combo of those two but Matcha ramen with the whipped cream on top. I asked the server he said it was just a picture that meant to give you an idea. But I think it is very misleading.Overall this is an average ramen place with some seasonal less-common flavored ramen. May go back to try the Spicy whipped cream ramen soon." u"Finally came in to try the whip cream ramen! It's a cute shop in Hell's Kitchen not too big but cozy. You can see the chef making the ramen in front of you.I think the basic ramen is decently priced ~$10 but the special ones are $15+ after tax. And the portion isn't big. I don't eat that much but for lunch after the ramen I didn't feel full enough so if you are a guy you'd def going to order more than the ramen. They do lunch special that has ramen and rice which is around $15 as well. I though the ramen was great and the whip cream is genius because it chills down the hot soup a bit. But the meat in the soup is a bit too salty." u'Came here last week because all the other decent places in the area had a ridiculous wait. Service was super fast - we were one of maybe two tables when we walked in...by the time we left most of the tables were filled. The ramen was delicious! I recommend this spot fo sho.' u"Just your really average ramen place 2.5/3 stars. There is lunch special ($12-$13) from Monday to Friday from 11am - 2:30pm and until 3pm on weekend. Came in on Monday just before lunch special ended and ordered a ramen + spicy cod rice bowl. Food came so fast ( I was the last customer to order). The ramen was surprisingly simple: thin noodles + pork bone broth + mushrooms + 2 pieces of char shiu and scallion. The broth was salty (not too salty compared to other places) but it lacked depth. My test around the salt/broth question is how does the soup taste after I add water to it? The result was it fell flat. The water diluted the salt and the soup had also no flavor. The ramen was alright a little on the chewy side. The meat was probably the best of it all - a little charred and no too fatty. Could add a little more flavor though. Overall what a let down as I really want to find an alternative to ippudo wait/cost. Wasn't a bad bowl of noodle for what I paid for but Yelp has disappointed me again." u'Love this place. This place gives ippudo westside totto and nippori ramen a run for the money. I work in the area and go to all four restaurants "daily". \xa0This place certainly has some unique ramen bowls that the others just don\'t.Tip: \xa0It\'s cash biz and service charge is included. \xa0This is my new favorite spot. \xa0Keep it up!' u"Came here to try the interesting green bowl matcha ramen.We got the matcha ramen and spicy yuzu ramen both are priced at $11 (without soft boiled egg) which is fairly reasonable. The matcha ramen soup base is indeed very matcha light and with a bit of matcha bitter. Taste healthy and not heavy at all. It's an interesting dish but not something you will want to try again I think...The spicy yuzu ramen was probably by far my favorite ramen in the city! I'm not a fan of heavy tonkotsu ramen so those popular NY ramen spots are in general too heavy for me. The spicy yuzu ramen was literally spicy and yuzu! with definitely less fat in the soup base and it's refreshing not heavy and not too light. We both love this dish so much!Their noodle is good but not the best. I'll definitely come back for the spicy yuzu again!" u"Call me crazy but I would much rather come here than going down the street to Totto Ramen (or Ippudo).The reason?I like the fact the ramen here is tasty but doesn't give me that overwhelming greasy feeling that I experienced at Totto. \xa0I tried the chasew/pork ramen and it was pretty solid. \xa0The broth wasn't greasy (although like most ramen places it was relatively salty) and the pork was tender and extremely tasty. \xa0The actual noodles had a balanced texture and was perfectly cooked.The matcha ramen also was solid. \xa0Vegetarians will absolutely love this dish. \xa0The soup base for it was smooth and it had a refined feel to it. \xa0If you come here you can't really go wrong with either option!I also ordered the karrage/fried chicken appetizer and it tasted as good as it looked. \xa0This dish also wasn't overly greasy and was surprisingly flavorful.The ambiance here is pretty chilled and the staff is very attentive. It's not easy to open a ramen joint in an area that's quickly being saturated with other options but at least this place manages to hold its own!" u"I had the matcha soy milk ramen here it's really good! I would recommend it even if you're not vegetarian. The soup is really well done - you can still taste matcha within that savory soup. The noodle is very thin and chewy as well!" u"Mentoku is a small humble ramen place in Hell's Kitchen overshadowed by Ippudo and Totto. The Hakata-style ramen is simple and decent the place is clean and there are typically no lines. Note that Mentoku is cash only." u"Mentoku is a nice spot in the neighborhood. TINY spot so be prepared to have people's butts in your back and jackets brush your head as they enter and exit. It's a dimly lit restaurant setting a calm vibe. Place was packed at 12-12:30 and was almost empty by 1PM on a Thursday. Very narrow space in between tables but at least the tables still look new and clean. Expect to wait a bit to get your order taken and check. It's fine but if you're in a rush it could test your patience.We ordered the Ganryu and Tonkichi ramen. The broth is not bad but a bit too oily for my liking. I wish it came with an egg like some other spots. The pork pieces were okay. Large pieces but a bit fattier than Ippudo's. I'll have to say that this place achieved what few other ramen spots have for me - less salt! I wasn't chugging down glass after glass of water after leaving the restaurant. It's a peaceful alternative to the popular spots like Ippudo and Totto that have crazy wait times." u"The yuzukosho-men is nice. \xa0Has a nice yuzu flavor. \xa0The noodle consistency is good. \xa0It has a nice spicy kick. \xa0Perfect for a cold day. I also tried the Matcha Ramen during lunch. \xa0Service was good and line wasn't that long." u'My son and \xa0were looking for dinner before going to see the 8pm showing of "Get on your feet!" over on 46th. We were cold (eve of the big storm) and had been standing outside for one of the theatre lotteries ("Hamilton") when sonny impulsive selected this place. We Yelped to be sure the stars were in alignment and they were! This is the best ramen place I\'ve been to and I\'ve been to Japan 50 times or more. If the storm had not shut down NYC I am thinking we would come back here again despite the distance from his apartment. The first selection we had were the pork bun. At $4/each that seemed a bit high but once we had them we were totally hooked. As overused as the word is - AWESOME! The pork has just enough tender fat to be nice and rich but not disgusting. The glaze is very tasty and the slices are generous (about 0.5" thick). The meat is not overdone and dried out as many places do to pork. It is even cut at the correct bias for maximum tenderness. Immediately we were addicted. The photo I uploaded does not do this thing justice. These pork buns make the visit worth it on their own.Of course on a cold night we wanted to have the hot ramen broth in our stomachs and Mentoku did not disappoint. We both got the spicy Yuzukoshu-men bowls and we both really liked what we ate. The broth was clearly house made and had layers of flavor. It was not out of a can but crafted with flavors of shiso. It was not over-salted or spiced either. Nice! I uploaded some shots of the nice presentation where you can see the wonderful pork slices on top. The pork was amazingly tender and tasty. The noodles were perfectly done - cooked to the perfect consistency. Save yourself a trip to Japan!One of the other indicators of how great this place is were the other people dining there. Most of them seemed to be "actual" Japanese. Businessmen and such who were looking for a slice of home. They clearly found it. Even the layout is similar to a \'real" Japanese establishment in that it has as super-narrow store front not a lot of space inside and an open kitchen. Perfect.A word about the chefs and staff. I understand a bit of Japanese. Not enough to be a translator but enough to know the outline of what is happening most of the time. The chefs and staff appear to actually be Japanese. I am of Japanese descent and can sort of suss these things out. The cooks servers - all Japanese looking and speaking. When does that happen over here short of a $100/plate dinner? I may be (a lot) biased but the level of quality and attention to detail in our food also showed that this was not a run-of-the mill ramen hashery. This is "the real thing". The one thing you should know before coming here is that you need to bring cash. No cards allowed. At all. My son and I had ramen two pork buns each and shared a sake. Our bill was in the $60 range. Plan accordingly. There are a lot of signs reminding you of the cash only policy too. When in NYC Mentoku is on my "must eat there" list!' u"CASH ONLY SPOT. \xa0This place is a small place and the service is excellent. \xa0The only weird thing I found is that since this is a small place the servers end up on the wall behind you while you eat at the end bar which felt like someone was watching over your shoulder. \xa0 When it comes to ramen it's all about the broth. \xa0 I ordered their Yozukoshu-men lunch special for $12 since for an extra dollar you get a side. \xa0The broth on this dish is definitely PEPPERY; \xa0it's more of a fish broth shoyu than a meat broth as well. \xa0The broth had a good spicy-ness but like I mentioned it was not my style of broth since it was pepper based but it was still manageable as I did finish it all. \xa0The ramen was perfectly cooked tasty and firm. \xa0The two meats they provide are deliciously fatty the only way to get the meat fat in the ramen which I liked. \xa0 It was garnished with seaweed which enhanced the broth as well as what looks like green onions. \xa0The side green salad was a basic ginger salad with some corn in it.I also had ordered their pork bun and it was a moist flavorful flat grilled deliciousness. \xa0The fatty pork which were good cuts were cooked tender and not chewy. \xa0The touch of lettuce and their cream sauce made it extra tasty. \xa0And the bun was soft as well. \xa0Needless to say I ended up ordering another although I don't know if $4 for one was justifiable. \xa0I guess it's NY prices but it balanced out since their ramen price was a very good price for NY." u"The little restaurant that probably seats 20 is nicely decorated. Looks just like a little ramen watering hole. But the ramen itself is decent but not as richly flavored as some other places I've tried.I had the spicy version of their ramen which also comes with lovely bamboo shoots. It had a kick which wasn't too fierce and wasn't bad overall. The piece of pork they put in there wasn't enjoyable but for me not being a pork eater or a fan having most of the broth was an achievement. Probably thanks to the spice component.The pork bun was pretty good. Cash only. Many signs letting you know about that!" u"Cash only (for now...).I came across this new place and saw the inside was nice so decided to have an impromptu meal.Food: can't beat the lunch deal ($12 for a ramen out of two choices and a side dish. You can upgrade your ramen by adding a dollar more). Was intrigued by the matcha ramen so we got that and then the pork broth ramen and rice topped with fish eggs. Both did not disappoint - I will be returning here again. The fish eggs over rice looks like it's disproportionate but you soon realize that a tiny bit of fish eggs is very salty so you will down the rice with it. (Dieters beware) the matcha ramen was very clean and light and the broth was easy to slurp on because it wasn't so heavy.Service: they speak in Japanese to you except when you order. They were fast about refilling the water and food came out very fast too. I think we waited less than 10 minutes to get our food. Payment options: as always my inclination is to steer clear of places that are cash only but this place (to be honest the matcha ramen) was intriguing enough that I scraped the bottom of my bag to find all the cash I had before walking in. I do think they will have to start accepting credit card soon enough this ain't china town.Overall a great new ramen option in Hell's Kitchen. Yay!" u"Ramen in NYC's cold weather = a dream come true. So many of my friends rave about the popular spots like Ippudo or Totto but it's really about these new smaller spots that people need to look out for.Once we go in we were greeted immediately! Irassyaimase! This place is tiny. Can fit maybe 15-20? We came during lunch and since this place is new there wasn't a line. Ramen was only $12 for their lunch special and you get a side of rice with fish roe veggie toe or extra noodles - you seriously can't beat that! I got the Yuzukosho-Men. It had a spicy broth with bamboo shoots pork loin chashu spicy pickles Japanese greens scallions and they added seaweed paper around the bowl. I added a soft boiled egg as well. This seriously hit the spot. The broth was warm and delicious. Towards the end it did get a little salty but nonetheless a great bowl of ramen!Highly recommend this joint." u'Best ramen in NYC! This place honestly reminded me of a little ramen shop on Tokyo and the flavors are absolutely delicious. \xa0not too salty or fatty and the yuzu blew my mind! I will be coming here again and again!']
63.District M,[u'This place is soo pretty. I could live in here all day! - However getting to the bathroom whether it is #1 or #2 is horrible. What if it is an emergency? You literally have to leave the place walk up the stairs around the take out place and then press the button to take the elevator down to the lower level floor. By then you probably piss or crapped in your pants. You would be in trouble. Our waitress was sweet. Play great music. Relaxed. Chilled Ambience.' u'The hostess of this place (around 8 pm) was the rudest person I have encountered in a long time.We are staying at the Row hotel. So far we were having a good stay.First she denied a glass of tap water to our kids. Then she alienared my entire family. The bus boy was amazing and came to apologize to us.How can anyone be so rude? How can the management of the restaurant hire a woman with these horrible manners?.' u"I came here for dinner and the flatbread was really good - service was quick and friendly. Mornings are a whole different story. Staff was *beyond rude* to the point that even if the food was good I wouldn't come back. However the food was not good. Fruit was old and pastries were dried out. I won't be back." u'Came here several time in end of July 2016 for breakfast.Staff is very rude.Barista named Nigel has some serious anger issues.When asked to correct my order he said to me: "i suggest you take a walk..."' u'RUDE SERVICE! DO NOT RECCOMMENDWe were looking for a place for our group to eat before a broadway show and the hostess was extremely rude. I asked if it was possible to eat on the ground floor because the restaurant is extremely dark and her response was "we\'re going to put you where we are going to put you. You didn\'t have a reservation so this is where we are going to put you." I honeslty have been to hundreds of restaurants and her rude service was so appalling I walked out and will never return here.' u"Surprisingly good gourmet hand-stretched pizza and live entertainment certain nights.They've got a focused (read: small) menu and the kitchen's good at what they do. Their Mulberry Street ($18; credit accepted) was a crowd-pleaser full of spicy fennel sausage mozzarella and roasted bell peppers. The cheese was super stretchy and the whole shebang came out in a jiffy.Service isn't the fastest if you need a follow up on your initial order but in their defense there's usually only one or two folks supporting a mob of patrons (locals and people staying at the hotel - this is a hotel bar)." u'Friday night. Kickass DJ and killer bartenders!! Do yourself a personal service and come here for a bevvy!' u'District M at the ROW NYC was great! They had live music one night and a Dj the other two nights of our stay. \xa0Raphael our bartender was the best! He surprised us with one of a kind custom drinks and was over the top in customer service. \xa0Will definitely be back!' u"I only ever stopped here for breakfast because I was staying at the row but it was great! The bagels were warm and the cream cheese butter and strawberry jam(which was amazing) were all free. The ham and cheese croissant was nice and the coffee was extremely good. The guys working there were very friendly and helpful. If you're at the row don't forget to stop by!" u"One star because the food was okay. We are staying in the hotel which is in the same building so thought we would pop down for a meal as it looked nice. We sat down for our meal and the waitress named Shelvey came over after about 5 minutes and asked us for our drink order as well as handing us the food menu. We ordered our drinks straight away and she returned a while later placing them down and leaving quickly before we could ask for some food. We then waited some time she never returned. We went up to the bar and \xa0asked if we could order food and the barman said we had to wait for the waitress. Another 10 minutes passed and I saw the barman talk to the waitress so she would come over. We ordered our pizza and she walked off. We had finished our drinks a while before she took the order and she didn't ask if we wanted more or clear the glasses. She returned with the pizza and rushed off again. Once we finished the pizza we had to track her down to try and get a cheque. After receiving the cheque I noticed she added her own 18% tip to the bill. She of course ran off again so I went to the bar to ask why we can't chose the tip amount. The barman said he can't talk to me to talk to the waitress. I said can he just answer my question to which the waitress appeared. She said it is 'state law' to add the tip themselves. The barman then said it is the minimum required tip in New York. I said to her I am not having that choice taken away how can they pick their own tip. She left and came back with a new cheque without the tip and said its New York State law to add 18% tips. I have been in America for a month now and eaten at multiple restaurants in New York and no one has added their own tip. They tried to take advantage of us not being from America and that is deceitful and disgraceful. I cannot believe that people would do this. We have tipped over 20% for people that gave us amazing service and will continue to do so. Safe to say Shelvey didn't get a great tip." u'It is inside the Row NYC formerly known as the Milford. That is why it is called district M? and M on the curtain? They serve continental breakfast with croissant from Payard and other famous bakeries. Cool lounge at night. You can watch CNN and other sport events on the projected screen on the big wall.' u"Very nice looking place! \xa0Clean open floor plan with plenty of natural light. \xa0I stopped in on a Sunday early evening so the place was far from packed. \xa0Sat at the bar and got great service and the cocktails we tried were actually as good as they sounded on the menu! \xa0After my Fifty Shades of Green (I think that's what it was called) the bartender helped me choose a great beer La Chouffe. \xa0 This place is a bit pricey for me but not for this area and I'd definitely hit it again. \xa0If you're in the area or on the way to or from a show you can't go wrong." u"Great place for a glass of wine or craft beer. \xa0 Quiet and cool next to craziness. \xa0 I didn't eat. \xa0But I like the vibe." u"Great bar and awesome staff. Stayed at the hotel for thanksgiving with friends and the bar is a fun place to gather and drink before heading out for the night. Bar staff couldn't be more accommodating. The weekend we were there Rapheal and Jim were behind the bar and were awesome." u'I brought a large-ish group of friends here this past Sunday. \xa0I had emailed the event person about reserving tables and received a confirmation but when I arrived the staff had no knowledge of this. \xa0However since I had been told that Sunday evening was quiet for them they had no trouble setting us up in a private back area so good save by the staff! \xa0Cocktails were great and their specialty pizzas were also delicious although a bit pricey. \xa0I would definitely come back here with a large group in the future.' u'District M is the ideal hangout inside The Row NYC hotel. Sip on a cocktail and soak in the chic ambience of this restaurant/cocktail lounge. Aaron was our server/bartender & not only was he super helpful/friendly - but a true mixologist. Any drink you can think of he can make it. Loved the dim lighting high ceilings and projector-like backdrop that looped black and white photos of legendary celebrities. Wednesday night a sensational Frank Sinatra entertainer - Michael Dutra - sang hits like My Way New York New York that gave District M an all around Big City feel.' u'We came to District M for drinks on our last night in NYC and our bartender was AARON. Aaron was so welcoming and informative about the area. We enjoyed his company and we would definitely come back to District M just because he was awesome!' u"Live Music and no cover charge in their bar! \xa0Timatha & Her TKO R&B Band kept us grooving all night to songs from Earth Wind and Fire Michael Jackson Bruno Mars Tina Turner and more! \xa0A great place to go for cool nightlife in Times Square! Food is available too... Beautiful swanky bar with candles and large artistic slide show too. Update: St. Patrick's Day bar party with Live Music Thursday March 17 2016 8:30pm - 11:30pm with green drinks party favors and dancing!" u'Nice atmosphere.Service was pretty slow but managers were nice.No sense of urgency but my friend and I enjoyed our leisurely bar experience.' u'I was really jetlagged from flying in from London and staying at the Row (hotel which District M is situated within.) I was waiting for my husband to get into NYC so decided to pop down to District M for some early dinner and a drink.I went in and sat myself down. No menus anywhere and no one approached me. I managed to spot a menu dumped on a table across the room so walked over and grabbed it to take a look. I was sat down for over 10 minutes and still none of the staff approached me (there were about 6 people standing around not doing anything.)I finally got bored of waiting and went up to the counter. No smiles. No greeting. I ordered a pizza and a very over-priced cocktail and the guy behind the counter (looked a bit like a manager) said "if you take a seat then we take your order at the table" I replied that I had in fact been waiting for 10 minutes already. No apology just a look of distain.Saving grace was that the pizza was delicious (but it would have to be for $20.) I finished my cocktail and I had to literally flag down a waitress to get a refill. And even then it seemed like I was inconveniencing them just asking. For a $60 bill I expect way better service. Really ruined my first experiences of New York. So many other places to eat nearby so just don\'t bother.']
6.Bea,[u'I made an online reservation for a party of 5 a month prior to the actual date. When the time came we were certainly impressed. It was on a Saturday at around 12PM. Got seated straight away to a gorgeous corner away from the main dining area. My husband his parents aunt and I all enjoyed the bottomless brunch for a very reasonable price. Endless tapas style portions of delicious food and cocktails. Be sure to order the bacon. And definitely the pomegranate mimosa! The service was top notch and the location was in the midst of all the hustle. I loved Bea and highly recommend anyone that likes great food and drinks to go there!' u"Super cool vibe with black and white movies playing on whitewashed brick walls crystal doorknobs and old school lighting but let's get to that green pasta because damn that was the jam. \xa0The best thing I tasted in New York. \xa0I might just dream about that garlic cream sauce. \xa0Nommmmmm! \xa0Do yourself a favor and check it out - so so tasty!" u'Was in the area to see a play with my parents and needed a decent dinner spot within close proximity. Being that this area is crowded touristy and low-quality i googled "non touristy restaurants in Times Square" and saw I already had this bookmarked on Yelp probably from reading some other article. It was 5pm and was able to snag a 6:00pm reservation. It was cool they seated just my mom and I since my dad was rushing over fromMidtown. We ordered the English muffin burger salmon and Chilean sea bass. All were so delicious. We also ordered the chocolate flourless cake and lemon pie. My parents killed the lemon pie so I assume it was good but no one liked the chocolate cake. I ordered the Lavendar monk cocktail which was just right! The food took a long time to come out but I appreciate the 2 different servers that came to reassure us it was on our way and they were good to double check in the kitchen. Friendly service and they came around often enough to check on us.Ambience was antique and hip - you wouldn\'t even know you were in Hell\'s Kitchen which is the exact vibe I was looking for. Gotta come back \xa0with my husband sometime!' u"Wow what a great deal for brunch. We arrived and it seemed relatively empty but we were told they only had spots at the bar which actually turned out to be quite pleasant except for the fact that we were right in front of the live band. The band was great just being so close made it really loud and hard for conversation. We were originally going to just get a few dishes and maybe a drink each but the bartender convinced us to get the brunch deal--$45pp for unlimited drinks and food. We got almost everything and none of the food was disappointing. I preferred the mimosas over the mixed cocktails. Definitely stuffed ourselves which I don't know if is good or bad but definitely worth the money." u"Made a reservation a week before for the July 4th weekend for 4 ppl. At the last minute had to add an extra person and they were able to without hesitation. When we arrived there we saw the sunroof room to the side that was flooded with glorious sunlight. It was absolutely beautiful with a tree in there. Initially we were going to be seated there but the sun was unbearable so they were able to seat us inside the restaurant. I really liked how there was a live band playing music the entire time. We decided to order the bottomless brunch only for $30 which was a great deal. You can order anything on their brunch menu so we pretty much did that. The tuna tar guac was our favorite so we ordered 4 plates of those. They're small serving sizes but perfect for a group of 4-5 ppl. We weren't fond of the scrambled eggs or asparagus but I liked the spaghetti pork french toast and fruit cup. It was a bit confusing who to tell our order to because so many waiters came to our table to clear our plates so we basically just told any random waiter our orders. It was a bit difficult to flag them down though which was frustrating. So I guess waiting to get someone's attention was the worst part. You think you won't be full but 25 plates later we were stuffed and extremely satisfied. 2 hours is definitely enough time to eat. Bottomless brunch is the way to go and I'm coming back here for sure. The owner is also very nice and even helped us take group photos!" u"$45 for all you can drink AND eat for 2 hours?? Sign me up! We came here with out-of-town friends who were visiting over Memorial Day weekend. They were accommodating to our large party of 6 people and seated us in a garden area which was really nice. The ceiling is covered with glass so it's not open air but you feel like it is. When we were there they had live jazz music playing just inside the restaurant which made us feel classier than we actually are haha.We sampled pretty much all the dishes and liked everything a lot. I think my favorites were Brioche French toast pork shoulder and egg boat! All the food was really flavorful and was a good size for splitting among everyone at the table. The drinks were really good too and my favorites among those were the Blushing Mimosa and the Carpe Diem. They weren't overly strong but just what you'd want for a brunch. Staff was very attentive and the food came out quickly despite how busy they were on a Sunday afternoon. I highly recommend this place if you want good food drinks and 2 hours to sample everything. Yeah $45 sounds pricey for brunch but I've been to other places where I don't get nearly as much and pay the same price. Believe me it's worth it!" u"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a reservation for a party of 5. Originally we had the reservation for 4 but last minute on the day of we had that changed and they did so without any difficulty. We arrived 20 minutes early and was immediately seated. The restaurant had live music as well. There's a sunroof room within in the restaurant that's actually really nice but because it was too hot and sunny we decided to be seated indoors at the booth which was great as well. We ordered the bottomless brunch without drinks ($30) and with the 5 of us had 24 dishes. Their plates are pretty small so basically like tapas but it was pretty filling though. There's a 2 hour limit for the brunch. However it was difficult getting a waiter to come around for our next order and after a while our dishes began to come out at a slower pace. The service began to decline as we neared the 2 hour mark. The food was good but our favorite definitely was the tuna tar guac! Must order!Overall it a good brunch place and worth going to." u"Wowwwww... AMAZING SERVICE first of all (our waitress was Lara G. and she was literally the BEST EVER)! The food...I have no words... To find a place this late that serves this quality of food is amazing! We ordered the sea bass and green pasta and both were heavenly. Highly highly recommend both!We've been to Italy and the green pasta is right on the mark. Portion sizes are excellent! We'll definitely be coming back here when we visit on a late night!" u"Had a great dinner and drinks here with a couple friends from college. Cocktails were all delicious and our waiter was very friendly. I had the tuna guac and the lamb empanada and both were excellent. My friends really enjoyed their food too. Prices aren't cheap but for Manhattan they're nothing unreasonable: drinks $10 to $14 meals $25 to $45.We also all loved the ambiance. They have tons of old movie posters and had Casablanca projected on the back wall. We were seated in this awesome indoor patio with a tree and a glass roof - you get to feel like you're outside with the climate control and cleanliness of being indoors. Awesome!" u"Solid 5 stars. Outstanding service (the servers were so friendly and attentive) fun/quirky interior spacious seating area and most importantly amazing food:1) Tuna Tar Guac: one of the best tuna tartare appetizers I've had. The green wonton chips were interesting.2) Chilean Sea Bass: in love. The skin was perfectly crispy and it paired nicely with the side vegetables.3) Duck Turnover (my friend's order): even if you're not a fan of duck meat you'll love this empanada-style dish.Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time!" u"UPDATED REVIEW FOR BRUNCH: Previously I came to Bea for dinner but after revisiting the reviews I realized that I clearly should have gone for brunch instead. For $45 Bea offers a bottomless food and drinks brunch. Yes you've read correctly. For all the times that you've debated between getting a sweet vs. savory entree or a mimosa vs. cider fear no more because you can get as much as your stomach can fill at Bea's. Note that everything is also tapas size so a group of 3+ hungry people can easily work its way down the whole menu!I tried both the pomegranate and the pineapple mimosas and they were delicious! Out of the 10+ tapas that we ordered my favorites were the French toast with Nutella spaghetti and eggs (ordered 2x) candied bacon fruit bowl and ricotta cheese. Some of the other items like the asparagus and mushroom with white truffle oil and egg boat were a bit more forgettable. My friends and I showed up at 11 and easily snatched a booth but we noticed that the restaurant quickly started filling up at noon so try to make a reservation if you can!--Very hipster restaurant with a romantic twist! The place is great for couples. There are lots of 2-person tables and booths. I ordered the sea bass which was super fresh and had a great blend of citrus and butter flavor. I would highly recommend it! My friend who wasn't feeling particularly hungry ordered the tuna tar guac. She loved the chips which had a unique fried texture but she thought there was too much guac and not enough tuna." u'Omg was this a great find.... From the minute we walked in this place was amazing... Live music fabulous ambience and outstanding service.. we came for brunch unlimited drinks and tapas for 2hrs and we were never disappointed... Rachel and Mark were amazing... Very attentive and hospitable... Now the food that was by far the most delightful mouth watering tapas I have had in a long time... we already have told our friends and we will definitely be coming back...' u"* no happy hour specials here *I came here on a Monday night with a 7:30pm reservation. Even at prime dinner time the restaurant was pretty accessible and spacious. We were seated in their garden-esq room and I thought this area was so cute! Their tuna tar guac was delicious and my absolute favorite dish of the night; we had two orders because it was so good. It only comes with 5-7 pieces of wonton chips but you can always order more chips (they will charge you a penny each time you order more chips FYI). We also ordered the steak & tomatoes the green pasta the duck turnover and the mac & cheese. It was a perfect amount for four people. The duck turnover was a bit on the heavy side in my opinion the steak was cooked perfectly the green pasta had a shrimpy taste (if you're into that) and the mac and cheese was on the heavier side but lighter than the duck turnover which was surprising." u"A hidden gem in Hell's Kitchen! Came here on Sunday at 5pm and the restaurant started filling up immediately after we sat down. It has a divey hip vibe with old movies playing on the brick walls. The bar is situated in the middle with nice lights around it. The booths offer just the right amount of privacy. I loved everything we ordered. You can't go wrong with the beets & bleu cheese salad. The lamb meatballs were delicious! Pita bread toasted perfectly and paired well with the tomato dip.Tried their green pasta and marinated shrimp and the creamy sauce is delicious. Best of all it was only $19 cheaper than pasta entrees at pure Italian restaurants.Would definitely return one night for cocktails!" u"Love this energy service atmosphere music and the food! What a great casual bar restaurant that's hip and cool with a touch of old school. \xa0Vibrant bar seating in courtyard and and has small living room area at the back. A must go of your headed to or from the theatre or just out walking the city. \xa0Sliced filet with tomatoes and French fries was delicious as were the grilled Australian lamb chops over a spring freed salad with avocados and blue cheese. Yum! Oh...the flourless chocolate cake was to die for!" u"Bea is really a 3.5 stars kind of place. I love that there's a non-tourist non-traditional theater district restaurant that has good food. It's relatively close to Times Square but is thankfully lacking the gawkers. The atmosphere is fine it's pretty and quirky inside - my favorite space is the interior courtyard - and the staff is attentive and very friendly. I really like the bar - it's good looking and spacious with plenty of sitting. The cocktails are great - especially the gin cocktails. The Cagney was my favorite. The food is good and fine. I didn't find it to be ah-maz-zing as some other reviewers. \xa0Just fine. I had pork dumplings which were serviceable; beet salad which was good but predictable; and the famous green pasta. I have to say I don't get the fuss. It's spinach linguine in a creamy garlic sauce with shrimp. Again tasty and good but not out of this world. I feel like I've had a variation of that dish at Italian restaurants many times before. \xa0Dessert - a slice of chocolate fudge cake - was very rich. My end of meal cappuccino was fantastic and beautifully presented. I would come back here for drinks and nibbles at the bar on a Monday or Tuesday. Otherwise the noise level is uncomfortable. I was there on a Thursday night for dinner and it was too too loud. Upshot is this is a good restaurant to eat with friends in the Theater District that offers a nice alternative to more touristy options. However it is very noisy and you're better off hanging out at the bar or interior courtyard earlier in the week." u'Excellent venue with dim lighting fun music and old school decorations. The food was great- I ordered the uncle toms pie and the shrimp toast flatbread. My partner ordered the salmon and it was delicious as well. The service was excellent as the waiter was very personable. The also have a collection of fun cocktails that I will have to try sometime. $80 total for three great dishes and a cocktail.' u'Good but if they could figure out their timing it would be perfect! The food took FOREVER to come out (both appetizers and main course). Getting our check also took way too long. For a place where people are trying to make a show they need to be more efficient.They take reservations and it\'s a lot more "hip" than many of the restaurants in the area and clientele skews younger. Focused menu with American food and well crafted cocktails. Beautiful back area for larger groups. Very kind service. We shared several apps- lamb meatballs dumplings ricotta toast and an entree: lamb chops. Lamb was delicious and my favorite bite of the night was the ricotta and honey toast. Food was great both in taste and presentation. Portions were very generous for the price.' u"Came here with a big group and the overall experience was great. They allowed us to be seated before the whole group was present which was a huge plus in my book. They didn't pressure us to order and food came out around the same time so we didn't have to wait too long for everyone to start eating. I do have to say that their menu was varied enough but did not have too big a selection. A few people ended up ordering the same thing. It's not a problem that people are trying the same thing but it does say something about the options that the restaurant is offering. We didn't get any drinks so I can't comment on that. Their fries were amazing but had wayyyyy too much salt on it. It's like they just threw a clump of salt in and hoped we didn't die of thirst. I had the mushroom pizza and I can't complain it wasn't amazing but it was still good. I think we all felt that the food was good but mindblowingly good.I wish that we were seated in the atrium but I was still feeling the overall vibe of the restaurant. It's a rustic western type feel. They had some old western cowboy movies being projected around the restaurant which really added to the atmosphere. I do have to dock a few points because we had a cake with us (they charge a cutting fee!) but they didn't use the candles that came with the cake. It's not a huge thing but those candle are designed to burn slower. Instead they used their own candles and we ended up some wax on the cake." u"Not feeling the hype here. Very cute inside but a bit loud. Great service. Appetizer menu is on fleek dinner menu is on weak. Don't bring the picky eater here because there's only about 5 entrees to choose from. Come here for apps and wine with a group of four or two. Enjoy the ambiance. Sip on expensive cocktails and then walk to schmackerys next door and get some cookies."]
189.The New York Beer Company,[u"Used to work here. Now I basically live here. Shout out to Mike Fran Manny and Rob. Best bartenders in the world! Remember: Happy hour Mon-Fri 12-8 ($5 specials!!) Lunch deals Mon-Fri!!!Daily specials like 2:1 Stella's on Mondays!Try NYBC and you'll never want to leave!" u"Ordered delivery showed up in 30 minutes. Sweet.The buffalo chicken pizza was really good. Not too salty no ingredients missing. Just a perfectly balanced slice with plenty of chicken and sauce on top. It's really hit or miss in this area with pizza spots and this place is definitely worth a shot." u"Great food! Our group got pizza Maxed out burger turkey burger and truffle fries. The truffle fries were amazing! But the crowning jewel was the maxed out burger. I thought my friend was literally going to cry because if the deliciousness. He just kept staring at his burger and closing his eyes. He said it was the best burger he's ever had. Nothing special about the decor and feel of the place. Decent bathrooms. Wide open spaces around tables and not too loud. Service was ok. 4 stars based off the quality of the food." u'I stumbled across NYBC while I had a few hours to kill before my bus home. I sat at the bar and they put the game on for me. My end of the bar and the rest of the restaurant was relatively quiet. I ordered two Moscow mules and a classic burger (medium rare plus cheese and avocado with a side salad). I should know better than to order a burger that rare but it still tasted ok and was actually a pretty good burger. It was a good size and I probably would\'ve finished every bite if not for making myself nervous about the amount of "pink" (totally my fault though).My drinks were pretty good (just a little too much lime juice) and the bartender I had was very friendly. I believe her name was Fran? She was very sweet and conversational and seemed to know many of her customers. If I am back in that neighborhood I will definitely be back!' u"Loved loved loved this place! I came here for brunch before a Broadway show and I was soooo satisfied. The tv screens are so big you can't miss a move while the game is on and staff is super nice. The steak and eggs and eggs Benedict were yummy oh and bottomless mimosas ... Say word!!!" u"I was invited by a friend we decided to stop by after work . Came in no problems being seated. Waitress did take a bit of time to come around this was pretty much the case for the entire time we were here. Nice to know they offer happy hour specials  I decided to give the Pomegranate margarita A try  ahh it wasn't that great taste like lime juice. My friend had a Stella  can't go wrong. Since my drink wasn't that great I decide to go with a Blue Point beer from the happy hour menu not bad decent beer. Appetizers we went with an order of the Truffle Fries  good fries great dipping sauce. Main dish I went with the Avocado turkey burger my friend had the Classic Burger both with Salads.My avocado turkey burger was really good  good tasting meat nice flavor topped with the avocado it was just right.The side salad was pretty good as well good dressing. The classic burger was also good.As for the place it self it's pretty big which u don't realize till u take a walk to bathroom  good size bar plus another seating area. Fun decor  service was good but slow & price wise it was decent." u'We were coming back from a day of touring and decided to check this place out since Sunday Night Football was playing. \xa0It was a mixed experience.First for the good. \xa0It is very inviting and has a nice atmosphere \xa0(where workers were in football jerseys). \xa0The beer menu was great and I found a couple of super ones to drink. \xa0The hummus appetizer was delicious (crispy pita and just the right garlic in hummus). \xa0My arugula salad was nice also (I know odd thing to get in bar but I needed something healthy).Unfortunately nobody else liked their food. \xa0My nephew got the Phillies cheesesteak and could not eat two bites \xa0(it did taste odd). \xa0My sister -in-law got the veggie burger and also could not eat it. \xa0Then my other nephew did not like his burger.It was really busy and maybe a bad night but not a great experience overall.' u"You'll find me here for almost every UFC PPV fight night because there's NO COVER CHARGE. And good beer. And good company. The staff is friendly and easy to talk to and the place itself is really nice. Good for group hangouts or dinner with family or just to go to for no reason. :)" u"Met a friend here for post brunch drinks on Saturday. \xa0I joined him at the end of the bar and while we were sitting right in front of servers/bartenders I was ignored. \xa0So I grabbed a menu off one of the dining tables and got the bartenders attention. \xa0They most likely picked up on the fact that I did not appreciate being ignored. \xa0Service after that was fine. \xa0I stuck to my go-to German beer while my friend enjoyed his whiskey. \xa0Tried their hummus plate which was just OK.When I asked one of the bartenders what type of whiskey and scotch they have she directed me to the section of the bar where they were displayed so I'd have to get up leave my friend to take a look. \xa0Really? \xa0She should've either handed me a menu listing their spirits (they don't have one) or simply told me what they have. \xa0This is customer service 101 people. \xa0Maybe they're used to handling tourists in such a manner given it is the theater district but that doesn't fly with me!" u"I'm not sure what was going on today. It was terrible! So I was there just to meet up with some friends who were in town for a wedding. It's a huge space and it's located right in the prime tourist area.So I sit down at the long communal table near the back and things were fine. Then water started dripping on my friend from the A/C vent above her. She's the kind of girl that didn't care but it was kind of gross watching it drip on her hair and food for an hour.When the food came out the server (not our waitress) placed plates randomly in front of people without caring. It was insane. We all were stunned then played musical chairs with the plates. The waitress was apologetic but this was such a bizarre thing.Then I ordered diet coke which was complete flat. Seriously 0% carbonation. It tasted like very stale coke that's been sitting there for a week. I told them about this and they gave me another glass that had a little bit of carbonation but clearly not normal. I should have not had them charge this at all because I couldn't even have any but I didn't.I will not be back here." u"So here I was on a Saturday during the holidays coincidentally enough during SantaCon and I was hungry. My boyfriend and I were in the city celebrating our 7 month and we wound up in the Hell's Kitchen/Midtown area. You can only imagine how packed the city must've been with everything I just mentioned. As two very hungry boys we needed ASAP. After hearing long waits at different restaurants we went to our hope was starting to fade away. But lo and behold we found a side street with The New York Beer Company taking up residency there.Walking in there it looked like a typical sports bar. TV's playing games a lot of beer and numerous people there conversing with drinks in hand. But shockingly enough there wasn't a sign of anyone there wearing SantaCon apparel. We found a safe haven.After sitting down at our table we both ordered a Magic Hat #9 from their extensive list of beers. I was beyond happy to see so many craft beers there as I'm starting to have more and more in my palette. We ordered a plate of Mozzarella Sticks for an appetizer and I decided to order their Spicy BeerBQ Cheeseburger with Truffle Fries. The fries were absolutely delicious as you can taste the truffle in them which them gave them a particular bite. The burger itself had red hot cherry peppers on top with a beer-infused BBQ sauce and a blend of bleu mozzarella and cheddar cheese. I typically don't get burgers but theirs was beyond juicy and tender. Thank you for turning me back onto burgers New York Beer Company.Overall the place had an amazing vibe to it. I was even more surprised that it wasn't crowded with everything that was going on in the city that evening. Definitely a hidden gem that you need to try." u'5 stars for the fact that they air UFC PPV fights. 5 stars for the fact that they take reservations. 4 stars for the beer draft selections and 3 stars for how crowded it can get. This is my friends and i go to spot to catch the UFC PPV in Manhattan. It can get pretty busy but the drinks are okay and the food seems to be solid.' u'Great pub food and enjoyable welcoming atmosphere. A great place to sample and fulfill your hankering for various craft beers.' u'I typically hate locations like these but once I tried their truffle fries I feel in love. Delicious truffle fries that I can have again and again. A little bit too large of a venue for my taste but whatever. Tons of craft. Nice crowd despite its location.' u"Bar with a decent beer selection though not as great as some others. \xa0They serve the Founders Oatmeal Stout and that was enough to keep me happy. \xa0It's a nice place to watch sports games as they have a fair amount of large televisions around the space and one particularly large one (don't recall if it was a projector screen). \xa0Can't really say much about the food here as I didn't have any but looking around other people's it looked at least alright." u"Still one of my favorite places. Stopped in tonight to have a salad and slider with a cold cold cold Budweiser. As usual attentive and kind service from the bar staff. She is delightful and willing to go the extra mile. Didn't see Patrick tonight as I hear he is the GM now! I met him when they first opened. I'm sure my food will be great and so will this beer! Cheers to those who choose to eat at NY Beer Co. It's literally my neighbor and always nice to hang out at the bar." u'"For when you need a break from Times Square"My craft beer club had met here a few times and I love this place. Like many NYCers I want to avoid Times Square like the plague unless I absolutely have to go there. But this place calms my anxiety of going to Times Square. Perhaps it could be the large selection of beers. The space is Huge and it has several TVs with sports. I have not try the food but people in my beer club love the sliders and wings. The beer ticker is kind of cool. Warning this place is very loud but if you are in the Times Square area then probably you are used to it. So check it out.' u'Great food great service and good beer selection all at very reasonable price. Would definitely visit again.' u"I thought the concept of this place is so cool because they have a beer stock exchange going on and it makes the experience of eating here fun and there's TV everywhere so you can't go wrong with that. They also have a great selection of beers but ask what they don't have before you get excited about any beers because they were out of a bunch of beers when we were there.We each got food and some beers. I got the classic burger medium-well because I guessed you couldn't go wrong with a simple burger and I was starving. The burger was over cooked and it was dry so not my favorite but I have to say the fries were amazing so definitely get fries! My coworker also got a burger and he also thought that his was dry and overcooked.Our server was attentive and came back to check on us as needed so that's good." u"Fab food n service. \xa0It's a great bar to kick back with your friend and have beer plus a lite meal at the bar."]
80.Le Bernardin,[u"This is the 2nd time I have been here. Loved it the first time and the 2nd did not disappoint.Using my 5 star rating (1 star for each category): Atmosphere (1) - so pretty inside.Food (1) - got the chefs tasting menu. Caviar was sublime perfectly salty and the cr\xe8me fresh added the brightness it needed. Lobster was perfectly cooked and the consume with it was so flavorful that I made sure I ate every drop in the bowl. Same w the langoustine w foie perfectly cooked and the sauce was so different than anything we ate. Salmon we both agreed was our least favorite dish. Everything else was ridiculous good. Kobe and tuna were both melt in your mouth and the dessert was fabulous.Service (.5) - first let me say our servers at dinner were so great - fun and professional (I would give them 10 stars). BUT when we made the reservation we were told you have to be out by 8 pm because they have another reservation. I HATE that. Some people don't mind I get that but for me you are airing your dirty laundry and if I am paying $400 (including tip and wine) for a meal I don't want to feel rushed. When you tell me I need to leave by 8 and there is a huge gap between courses I start to worry. I finally said something to our server that we were told we have to leave by 8 and of course he was great and said not to worry but the fact I felt compelled to say something to him says everything. Would I go back (1) - yes! Whenever I am in New York.Would I recommend (1) - yes4.5 stars" u"Places like this are reserved for special occasions. Which is why the only time I've eaten here which was for a birthday a few years back. It was fabulous.The service at Le Bernardin is impeccable and they love people who clearly have fun and get excited about beautiful food. The chefs and staff here are craftsman. Each dish is exquisitely constructed and they all tasted as good as they were presented. It was over a 3 hour dining experience. I think we got about four rounds of desserts with our meal. None of us could eat another bite by the second dessert but we desperately tried to make it through all the desserts as they were too stunning to leave untouched. A meal I will not forget. We also asked for a tour of the kitchen which was very nice of the staff to let us behind the scenes. If you would like to know Eric keeps a clean kitchen." u"My wife and I have traveled extensively and have dined at some of the world's finest restaurants. So it is from this very experienced viewpoint that I offer this review. \xa0The restaurant is nicely furnished and conveniently located. \xa0The service is good and the atmosphere is what you'd expect at \xa0 Micheline star rated restaurant. \xa0Now the food. Again I'm comparing this restaurant to ones on the same level - eg PerSe Stone Barnes etc. At best I'd say the food was okay certainly not worth money but better than an average restaurant. \xa0I was prepared to be amazed as one would expect of a restaurant of that caliber but I was only mildly amused. I also had the unfortunate experience of having a glass break in my hand and contents spill all over me. \xa0The crew were very quick to respond - changed everything on the table while we waited in the lounge. \xa0Typically when this sort of thing happens you'd expect the restaurant to offer to pay for the dry cleaning. No such thing here. \xa0To add insult to injury not only did the argue with my wife as to the cause of the incident claiming that I somehow caused but also charged us for the drink. \xa0This was a huge treat for us as we can afford but once a year to spend $200 per plate on dinner. And overall I'd say it was disappointment." u"Before this meal I have never been to a 2 or 3 star Michelin place. I opted for the alcohol pairing which was also my first time. Attire is dressy and jackets are mandatory. The pre-meal starter was a chimichurri tuna tartare and avocado vegetable roll. Excellent way to begin the meal. King fish caviar - sake pairing. Sake really enhanced the fish flavor and the fish itself was fantastic. Caviar flavor is very settle and hard to taste. Lobster - This sauce is amazing and best lobster I've ever had. The champagne really brought out the flavor in the lobster. 5/5Langostine and foie gras paired very well with the Riesling. Langostine and foie gras were very soft. I tried each one individually and then together and it tasted fantastic. Riesling brought out the flavor in both. 5/5Salmon was slightly fatty and very tasty although the Chardonnay didn't pair very well 4/5.Halibut was so soft and moist throughout. The mushroom soup paired very well with the halibut. 5/5Pinot noir pairing was odd. Didn't think they would pair a red wine with a fish. Wagyu beef and white tuna was very tasty. Wagyu was pretty fatty and the White tuna was medium soft. Barolo paired alright Roasted pineapple guava jam Yuzu coconut sorbet was so airy and very light. This dessert paired quite well with the wine. 5/5Coffee caramel almond mousse had a wafer that was so tasty. Almond mousse wasn't too sweet which is just the way I like it. The highlight of this course was the dessert wine that was paired with the meal. Service here is top notch and didn't expect any less. They even bring out little stools for holding bags and purses. Overall very enjoyable meal. Excellent food with great company is always a recipe for a fantastic time." u'My first Michelin starred dining experience! It\'s also #24 on The World\'s 50 Best Restaurants list. I was super excited to be dining here even though our reservations were at 10:45- the last time slot. My friend and I came here after watching a play that ran a little long and practically ran here before they closed at 11:00. We ordered from the prix-fixe menu- 4 courses for $147. At the beginning of the meal we were served bread. I know I shouldn\'t fill up on bread but the rosemary olive focaccia was really good with the soft butter. Then we were given three different amuse-bouches. For my courses I had tuna scallop white tuna-Japanese wagyu and matcha (dessert). My favorite was the tuna. At the end we had petit fours. Even though it was four courses+ it was a light meal. Service was great from beginning to end. We were well taken care of and were also given an extra dessert. I also love that the restaurant offer a variety of menus in the dining room and lounge so more people can get the opportunity to dine here without breaking the bank.*Seven James Beard Awards since 1998 including "Outstanding Restaurant of the Year" "Top Chef in New York City" "Outstanding Service" "Outstanding Chef in the United States" "Outstanding Pastry Chef" "Outstanding Wine Service" and "Best Restaurant Design." [As Seen on Best Thing I Ever Ate and No Reservations]' u'I had a 1045pm reservation but there was still a lot of people here just about to or just started eating as well. It\'s one big open space with the dining area and bar lounge area so it\'s loud. I\'m sure you can make this an intimate night but don\'t count on it.Either way I still had a great time here. I did the tasting menu and it was fabulous. My favorite was the halibut with mushroom and the "Apple" dessert.Le Bernardin really lives up to their reputation. Even dining by myself at 1045pm I didn\'t feel rushed or anything. There was no feeling of I can\'t wait to go home kind of feeling from the staff...especially when it\'s past 1am. And as for the bar...they have some really top shelf stuff. You can get fancy drunk here.' u"Came here spontaneously with a friend one night. We weren't sure if we were going to get seated since we were dressed down and after all this is a 3 star Michelin restaurant. We wanted to sit in the lounge area and lucky for us it was not a problem :) \xa0I was super excited I never been to LB before. Upon walking in the restaurant is beautiful spacious and intimate.. let's just say we were really under dressed especially for the dining area.The service was exceptional definitely one of the best experiences I've had in a really long time (I need to fine dine more). They really make you feel special here and everything is timed perfectly (when the food comes out when they take your plate and etc). We ordered a few items off the menu - the Lobster Cappuccino Peruvian Style Scallop Ceviche Kanpachi Tartare Apricot dessert and the Tres Leches dessert. Everything was unique flavorful and presented beautifully. Each plate really brought out all the flavors in every ingredient and dining here really expanded my palate. The Apricot dessert had roasted apricot caramelized honey cremeux and osmanthus blossom sorbet. The Tres Leches was my favorite dessert - crisp cashew sponge cake sphere caramelized goat's milk mouse and clementine sorbet.The Lobster Cappucino was earthy tasting but in a good way and it really was like drinking a cappuccino with Celeriac Soup and Perigord Truffle topped with Lobster foam. I had to order the scallop ceviche because I love scallops and I never had it in a ceviche and was probably my favorite food item of the night. Served in a beautiful shell it was really refreshing and light. My friend and I have actually tried to replicating this recipe at home since dining here since we loved it so much. The Kanpachi was topped with wasabi tobiko with an emulsion of ginger and coriander was very enjoyable as well.What I love about this Le Bernardin is they switch up the menu so it gives me all the reason to come back to try new items. If you love seafood you absolutely need to visit Le Bernardin. \xa0Every bite tastes better than the last and you want to eat it very slowly to enjoy it for as long as possible. Definitely expensive but it's about the quality here not the quantity and places like LB just makes me appreciate food so much more. Can't wait to come back and next time I'll be checking out the dining area." u'Summary: Likely the best restaurant that I\'ve been to so far in my life. There\'s a reason this place tops many best restaurant lists every year. Without a doubt the best seafood that I\'ve had.Went here for dinner while visiting NYC. Of all the meals I had in NYC and across the globe this place is probably the best. Seafood prepared with the highest quality ingredients and executed perfectly. The food:We did the three course price fixe menu. Everything we had was absolutely delicious. I won\'t mention everything we ate because it was a lot but I will point out the things that you must try.SEAFOOD TRUFFLE PASTA - order this without hesitation. This is probably the single most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my life. Fresh pasta perfectly al dente with generous portions of crab scallop lobster and black truffle. They finished it off with some black truffle butter. So rich so delicious. Impossible to convey how good this was. Black bass "surf and turf" - Crispy black bass with braised cheek. Perfectly crispy fish skin seasoned to perfection. The smokiness of the braised veal cheek gave a great balance to the dish.All the desserts - So we ordered three desserts and they brought out five. Awesome. They said the other ones were on the house. If memory serves correct we had:PERUVIAN CHOCOLATE - Warm Chocolate Cake Caramelized Fig Spiced Chocolate Ice CreamMANGO - Mango Parfait Hazelnut Dacquoise Thai Basil-Mango EmulsionMATCHA - Green Tea Custard Preserved Lychee Jasmine Ice CreamEXOTIC FRUIT "PAVLOVA" - Roasted Pineapple Guava Jam Yuzu-Coconut SorbetWe were also served a chocolate bourbon box dessert that was not on the menu. In addition they serve petit fours at the end. Everything was so incredible and it was so nice of them to give us all of these desserts to try. The service: exactly what you would expect from a three michelin star restaurant. Service was impeccable and absolutely top notch in every way. Overall: possibly the best restaurant that I\'ve been to. Can\'t wait to go back. If you go you must order the seafood truffle pasta. It\'s the real deal.' u"Five Stars for service Five stars for taste five stars for making us feel welcome and special. Portion size five stars and selections five stars. It is hard to find anything wrong with tonight's meal. I won't sleep tonight I'm so full! \xa0I've got a couple more photos on my daughters camera. There were so many courses I can't remember all the names. They asked up front about my allergies. I feel comfortable knowing my food was prepared with my health in mind. They even have a little stool to put your handbag on instead of on the floor! Lovely atmosphere not overly gaudy. I'm definitely not a food review writer. This was a once in a lifetime experience for me!!Thanks to everyone involved for a memorable evening. My photos will have to tell the story....." u"If you're a college student like I am - GET THE CITY HARVEST LUNCH PRIX FIXE!Such a great deal at $49 for 3 courses.The service was exceptional and the flavors and textures were delicate. I'm not usually a seafood fan but I enjoyed my lobster carrot soup and even my friends' scallops. I got the sea bass for my main and tried the Merluza as well. Larger pieces of fish than I expected and the sauces were exquisite. Can't wait to come back again to try the full tasting menu" u"This was simply the best meal of my life. I had long desired to go to a 3 Michelin starred restaurant and when my wife and I came to NYC for our fifth anniversary Le Bernardin was definitely on our list. We ordered the Le Bernardin tasting menu with wine pairing. It was worth every last penny. The food was phenomenal and each dish surprised you with something - not something lavish or out of the ordinary even but with how profoundly good it was. One of the big shocks for me was how extraordinarily well each wine paired with the meal. Aldo Sohm is a genius. This took what was already an excellent meal and made it simply phenomenal. I can't afford to eat at Le Bernardin often but when I do have the spare money it is going to be high on my list - even before trying other restaurants. I enjoyed it that much. As a final note I am not a seafood person. I almost didn't go to Le Bernardin precisely because I am a serious meat eater. This would have been a tragic mistake. Try Le Bernardin - I challenge anyone to eat that crusted snapper and not fall in love." u"KenScale: 9.0/10After checking out countless fine dining establishments throughout New York and beyond there were moments that I would tire of haute cuisine. Sometimes simplicity pays off way better with faithfulness to freshness of ingredients and solid execution when I visit restaurants. All this use of emulsion exotic ingredients and fancy cooking techniques may look great in picture but not all restaurants delivered quite the way that I had anticipated. One exception to this evolution of my taste is Le Bernardin and it shows why this perennially famous and rightfully acclaimed restaurant has been in the ultra-competitive New York dining scene for the past 30 years. Chef Eric Ripert doesn't play safe; he surveys the world for more inspiration (last year's NY Times article about his visit to a tiny Buddhist temple in Korea to learn more about the temple cooking from a female monk there is Exhibit A) and brings what he has observed to the table. While the seafood-oriented dishes at Le Bernardin are ostensibly French they draw influences from all over the world. On my last visit for lunch with summer interns at my firm I learned yet again the boundary that the kitchen is willing to push for another spectacular meal.In Le Bernardin's cooking emulsion is the central part of most dishes but that doesn't mean that the kitchen pays less attention to the main seafood. They care deeply about the quality of ingredients and make sure that the texture of seafood combined with the surrounding emulsion work together harmoniously. The barely cooked scallop had one of the most memorable textures in scallop as far as I can remember and combined with roasted bone marrow and calamansi-butter emulsion had impeccable elegance to flavor. As I tried bite after bite there was always something new to my taste bud that I couldn't quite pinpoint but was nevertheless stupendously wonderful. When you see seared cod coming from the kitchen you see all these cute little pieces of daikon-green papaya salad followed by Japanese nori-hijiki emulsion that may distract your attention. Yes the dish looks absolutely beautiful but better yet the cod was just cooked to perfection and again the balance of flavor and texture was something that I would not forget for a long time. After capping the meal with mango parfait accompanied by Thai basil-mango emulsion a delightful treat that had the right amount of sweetness to it without overpowering my palate I walked out of the restaurant an extremely happy man. The three-course prix fixe at Le Bernardin which has now gone up from the $70s per person from my previous visits to $85 per person is still one of the best lunch bargains in town if you want to explore the depth of chef Ripert's philosophy to his cooking. Getting the reservation at Le Bernardin is still extremely challenging for dinner but the lunch reservations tend to come by more easily. Too bad it was lunchtime for work functions so I couldn't get a glass of wine to complement this wonderful meal. The dining room still oozed the classical beauty that I remembered on my previous visits. I'm so glad that Le Bernardin is still going as strong as ever; with the passage of time the quality of food at a restaurant tends to suffer as the head chef expands his or her businesses or the insanely fickle New York diners move on to the next hot places. There is a reason that this place remains one of the best dining destinations in the greatest food city of the world." u'Started good and went downhill from there.I opted for the Chefs Tasting menuThe initial dishes of Salmon Tartar of a caviar and seafood parfait was excellent and full of flavor. Then everything went downhill. Dish after dish of bland nearly flavorless food. The salmon and peas tasted more like not quite ripe peas than the large piece of fish that it surrounded. The lobster was extremely tough and took a lot of work to cut through. The Foie Gras had a stringiness that I didn\'t think was possible. Also hard to cut through another thing I didn\'t think was possible. The final dish included a piece of wagyu beef that was both the saltiest toughest and most overcooked piece of wagyu I\'ve ever experienced.The deserts were boring the "coffee" dish tasted nothing like coffee and had a bizarre grainy texture.The alcohol markups are the highest I\'ve ever seen for a restaurant it makes Las Vegas look cheap. The coffee and sparkling water are an additional charge of $7 for a mediocre cappuccino and $9 for 1 liter of pellegrino and gratuity isn\'t included in the price. Checking other reviews from the past week there seems to be a lot of similar sentiment.On the plus side they gave me a copy of NYC Zagat 2016 so I can find a place where I should have gone instead.' u'Le Bernardin had been on our list for a while and last my girlfriend brought me here to check this one off the list and taste some delicious delicious seafood.Before jumping into the food I have to say the plates Le Bernardin uses with the little bubble accents are a nice touch. Would love to buy a few for the house - I\'m guessing they don\'t sell these at IKEA.We opted for the Chef\'s Tasting which currently runs $215 per person. The meal starts with a a trio of amuses (on said bubble plates) - ours featured smoked salmon lobster and watermelon soup. Nice and refreshing and probably meant to foreshadow the seafood-forward plates to come.- Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio; Iberico Ham "Chutney" Sea Beans Lemon-Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Comes out as a circular disk of pounded carpaccio in olive oil. Tuna is delicate and melts in your mouth - the dish is really much smaller than it looks. Good thing there are plenty of courses after this one.- Warm King Fish "Sashimi;" Osetra Caviar Light Marini\xe8re Broth - I think this is one of the restaurant\'s signature dishes and would guess it\'s been on the menu for a while. Flavors are excellent here - I imagine this is what eating straight from the ocean is like. The salty/brininess from the broth and caviar work well with the king fish.- Pan Roasted Langoustine; Foie Gras Soubise Aged Sherry-Verjus Vinaigrette - absolutely one of the best bites of food I\'ve had in my life. The langoustine is absolutely the star and is cooked perfectly. Whether or not you\'ve had langoustine before this dish will make you love it.- Lacquered Lobster Tail; Herb Spring Roll Lemongrass Consomm\xe9 - clever play on the "lobster roll" - you get lobster two ways in this dish: a lobster tail and a sort of lobster sushi roll both sitting in lemongrass broth.- White Tuna Grilled Escolar and Seared Wagyu Beef; Fresh Kimchi Asian Pear Soy-Citrus Emulsion - their form of surf and turf I suppose? Much preferred the beef side of the plate but both were excellent.- Green Tea Custard Preserved Lychee Jasmine Ice Cream - classic Asian-inspired flavors. Very refreshing though - comes topped with these crispy green tea noodles.. best way I can describe them.- Marinated "Golden Blueberries" Frozen Sweet Corn Meringue Blueberry Sorbet - visually this dish looks like the contrast was turned up on the plate with the white sorbet and almost black blueberries some coated in gold coloring.- Semifreddo with chocolate as their version of a birthday cake and a few petits fours to end the meal. I don\'t remember these being too out of the ordinary but I was more than satisfied already at this point.There was a lot of hype surrounding Le Bernardin and expectations were high going in but I\'m happy to say that it lives up to it all. One of my top meals of all time for sure.' u"Let me start the review by saying that this is the nicest restaurant I have ever been to. When I first walked in I was blown away the decor; it feels as if you are in another world when you step into the restaurant off of the street. My favorite feature is the wall length picture of waves which really sets the tone for the meal. The service was outstanding from start to finish. For each dish the waiters swoop in and deliver everything at once applying whatever sauce the dish comes with. Almost every dish if not all of them involve seafood with a large portion of it served raw or close to raw; so if that's not what your into this isn't the spot for you. When we first arrived the waiter brought the table salmon rillete and bread which was a great way to start the meal. For an appetizer I got the crab filled calamari and followed that up with the crusted red snapper. The red snapper was my favorite dish and by far the best fish that I've had in a long time. No dish was less than excellent.At $85 for the lunch prix fixe menu it is rather expensive but if you are willing to pay that you won't be let down." u'Sorry that I could only choose three stars "A-OK" instead of four "a fan" at Yelp.My friend and I tried the brunch there and chose the 85 three-course prix fixe. My friend followed one of the waiters\' recommendation by ordering a black bass tartare a grilled black bass and a strawberry puree (the waiter said the first and second black bass would be different well yes...) and I chose truffle seafood pasta seared cod and exotic fruit dessert.Overall impression of the courses is salty and lack of aesthetic values. Both the black bass tartare and the cod were very salty. The grilled sea bass was nothing more than a piece of grilled bass with some broth. Pasta and desserts were fine. Four stars: truffle seafood pasta. The quantity of truffle and seafood was huge in comparison with the portion of pasta (cuz it is a starter). Taste was good. \xa0Two stars: seared cod. Very salty and do you think it is qualified as a three-star course from the picture? Three stars: exotic fruit dessert. Ok.We were guessing the chef was away during the brunch time but later we saw him in the dining room. Maybe the dinner will be better than the brunch.' u"AHHH possibly the best seafood restaurant I've ever been to. The food was so delicious so pleasing to the eye and the palate! We were expecting a lot from this place based on all the reviews and it being a Michelin Star recipient and we were not disappointed. As soon as we entered we were aware of our ages as the crowd seemed to be a bit on the older side lol. More of a reason for us to feel and act a little immature. Nonetheless after a drink (strong one) we seemed to fit right in (or so we thought). It was a group of 4 so we ordered different drinks from the menu and they all were pretty good. Our food didn't take long to be prepared and served. Every single thing we ate from the beginning to the end was immaculately prepared and exquisite! This is sort of a late review and I'm sure the menu has changed from when we had it about a month ago. I specifically remember all the dishes and the way they tasted it was quite a memorable experience. One thing we were not a fan of were the desserts! We ordered 4 different kinds and none tasted as great as they sounded. The complimentary dessert they give you towards the end (Bonbon Macaroon and this sugar candy) was AMAZING!!! AH I was such a fan of the macaroon!! I could have a bunch of them even after all that dinner! Service & ambiance were great. I've read the previous reviews regarding service being not up to par with the restaurant's standards but I guess they worked on that and we were left with no complaints! Definitely worth going to and worth the money!" u"The Quick: The epitome of classy sophisticated borderline stuffy French restaurants. The food is phenomenal and the service is top notch treating you as if you are the most important customer of the night. Oh... And the price is crazy extravagant. The Details: I cannot say enough about the service and feel about this place. The men had to wear suits and every single woman in the restaurant wore a little black dress. I was wearing a red slinky dress... Oh I got some looks. We did the chefs tasting menu with the wine pairing. Each course was brought out on a unique beautiful plate. Every last detail was elegant. The food was phenomenal as to be expected. The portions were small but we left satisfied. The different breads were delicious but I would recommend only trying one as I was told 'to go' bags are not allowed. The Damage: The chef tasting menu for two with the wine pairing and then additional glasses of cava ~ $800 pre tip... As I said do not go unless you're prepared" u'Great food great service. Expensive. I had the chef tasting. Everything was very good.The stand out dishes were:The lobster in the lemon grass consomme the lobster and consomme were outstanding.The langoustine and fois gras also amazing. The langoustine tasted so good. The white tuna was amazing. I took the servers advice and traded the salmon for a scallop/ langoustine/ pasta truffle dish. It was ok. It was my first time having truffle. I told the waiter it was just ok and they brought me out an additional dish. Amazing service.The halibut texture was also just ok. Would definitely return maybe once a year type place because of the cost.And there is a dress code jacket required. I was not sure about wearing sneakers but I saw someone wearing the.' u"I try not to get political in my Yelp reviews (because that would be pretty weird) but I'll admit it:I'm feeling Le Bern. This place is straight class. For gods' sakes the coat check ticket is metal. They are lucky I didn't steal that thing and melt it down to pay my rent after eating here. Do you think there's a tip jar out for the coat check staff? Absolutely not. This isn't Brooklyn. Here in Midtown there's a wooden slot where I'm pretty sure you're only allowed to drop bills larger than fifties. I didn't jam my hand down it but maybe I should've because this was the fanciest (and most expensive) lunch of my life. And it was good. From the salmon canap\xe9 we started with to the beautiful bottle of wine we settled on (with the help of a lovely sommelier) to the barely touched tuna and the surf and turf of black bass and braised veal cheeks...I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The service is actually perfect. Everyone is warm and so very very competent. As our first courses were delivered I jokingly complained that everyone else had a sauce poured onto their dish but me. Well I'll be damned if some guy didn't appear with a yuzu dashi out of nowhere just for me. I'm pretty sure that sauce was supposed to be on my plate already and was just a step behind but the point is that the staff at Le Bernardin is basically a bunch of seafood fairies floating around and making sure life is delicious. You might be asking yourself why is this glowing review only four stars? [Well stop talking to yourself. It creeps the rest of us out.]The answer is that while everything was quite nice at this price point I essentially expect perfection. I expect to be staggered by my meal. I have been spoiled by the fact that for a third of the cost I can eat a meal at least as delicious at dozens of restaurants around this fine city. Granted the service may not be impeccable and the room may not be as grand but the food matters more to me anyway. Perhaps it's just that the level of cooking elsewhere has risen dramatically but the only bites that truly blew me away at Le Bernardin were dessert (and I'm not even really into dessert). I'm not sure who their pastry chef is but the orb of white chocolate that when cracked gave way to a burst of apple gelee...that was genius. It wasn't the best dessert I've ever tasted flavor-wise but it was certainly pushing boundaries and giving me something I've never had. Equally stellar was the salted caramel custard served in an eggshell a bit of lagniappe that surpassed most of the meal in quality.Is Le Bernardin an outstanding restaurant? Absolutely. Did I enjoy myself immensely? Of course. Will I be returning anytime soon? Probably not because this price point is too high for a peasant like me...unless it's a life-changing meal. And this wasn't. But it was damn good."]
199.Kiss My Slice,[u'I\'ve found myself going here almost involuntarily. \xa0It\'s not the pizza but rather the locale that keeps me coming back - it\'s got to be one of the top 10 best people-watching lookouts in NYC. \xa0A tiny open-air stall and standing-room only Kiss My Slice is next to one of the busiest intersections in the city and in front of a Times Square subway entrance. \xa0They\'ve got a few long narrow standing-only tables that jut out into the street allowing people to grab a slice chomp and leave within minutes. \xa0A nice by-product of convenience is high slice-turnover which in turn keeps them fairly fresh. \xa0The prices are completely reasonable for Times Square especially the standard "2 cheese + drink = $5" deal (the premium slices are $4).' u'I love their pizza! I worked by the Canal Street location and couldn\'t thank them any more for allowing me to have lunch that wasn\'t Chinese in the area. Unfortunately I recently found out that they are no longer here and have stuck with this location instead which makes a lot of sense. This is your typical "dollar" pizza location. Friendly staff and good food. However the joint isn\'t open late which sucks for late night drunken munchies and the pizza is also not a dollar unlike many other places in the area. Nevertheless it is a solid pizza place in the area and conveniently located outside Port Authority when you want to sneak a slice in before you head back to wherever you\'re coming from.' u"Ok yes. \xa0Definitely Ok. \xa0This place is grab and go and located in Times Square so it's convenient for us tourisits. I got a spinach ricotta the man got the pepperoni and jalapeno. \xa0I wasn't wowed by my slice. \xa0It was a tad cooler than I like it and didn't have much taste to it. \xa0Compared to my slice of white at another place yesterday this paled in comparison. \xa0The hubby's pepperoni and jalapeno was just ok as well. \xa0I didn't taste anything but the jalapeno. \xa0Service was great though. Super efficient and nice. \xa0They do take credit card but we paid with cash to make things easier." u"Yelp doesn't lead me astray that often but it did w/ Kiss my slice. Average margherita slice. Proximity to Port Authority makes this place tempting but it's not the 4star+ yelp makes it out to be." u"Pretty good pizza for a late night snack. They had a lot of selections to choose from and they were pretty busy. It was certainly more selections than the 99 cent pizza places I walked by that had nobody inside. I got the buffalo sauce with chicken as well as a pepperoni. I think the pizza was pretty good and wasn't too oily. I think that's key to a good pizza. I came after going to an event at skylark lounge which is nearby." u"Good place to get a slice of NYC style pizza. Had some good flavor to it. Crust sauce and cheese came together nicely. Yes it's kinda near time square and I don't feel it's a tourist trap. Check them out if in the area." u"Thank God I got a slice b4 heading out to Tarjays Black Friday sale in Brooklyn!! \xa0There's a half off Philips electric toothbrush wif my name on it! \xa0Yes it says Monica T. right on the box. This was the best NY slice I've had in a while!! \xa0Better than Prince St Pizza actually but not better than Difaras unmatched and still victorious. \xa0Hai truth's truth! \xa0This is huge. \xa0This is a game changer. That pepperoni pizza looked awesome from the start and was still delicious even after I got home from Bk 4. Hours. Later....Yeah I kept it for that long I know. \xa0I know. \xa0Karazy! \xa0The paper bag it was in had been gettin pretty greazy all the while but I see that as a good thing since I'm savin on a buncha calories. \xa0Go vanity!Their slices are incredibly wide and just perfectly thin at the same time. \xa0A big slice of deliciousness that is the essence of what NY is all about summed up in one slice. \xa0Genius. \xa0Oh and they've gotta really good sauce recipe with a quality crust cuz it tasted like a great cold slice with bread that was still really chewy. 4. Hours. Later.Most slices in NY taste gross when you eat it cold later but this one held up beautifully. \xa0I'm impressed and convinced.  \xa0Man was this slice awesome!!! \xa0The people runnin this joint were super sweet as well. \xa0It was that dude in one of their 17 pics. \xa0I think his gf was there and she was totally sweet as well! \xa0It's probly cuz they know they have sucha great pizza and they are just happy and nice people. \xa0I got take out from The Hummus co next door right b4 and they were kinda dicks there calling me mam a buncha times even though he was prob just a couple yrs younger AND being absent minded bout customer service so it's refreshing how nice they were at Kiss My Pizza.That slice really hit da spot!!! \xa0I can't wait to go back and I'm feeling lucky cuz there's a branch by my apt downtown. \xa0Yay!!! \xa0Yet you should all know \xa0that although they're in the same name game I much prefer the uptown KMS with their thinner n more saucy style but who am I to tell you what to eat. \xa0Oh right this IS Yelp." u"The slices were so good we ordered a whole medium pie to be delivered to the hotel waiting for us after we hit the club! Ask for Dano he's the owner and the man for any pizza pie questions!" u'Best pizza I had while in NYC. Ended up coming here like 4 times. Highly recommend Kiss My Slice over Rays Pizza.' u'Our favorite pizza delivery. We always order the everything on it pizza - and never were disappointed.' u"Had a pepperoni and jalape\xf1o and it may have been the best Pizza I have ever tasted. It was fresh the crust held together perfectly the cheese was balanced perfectly with the toppings and the value is awesome. I'd absolutely recommend this friendly place to anyone and everyone." u'This established has amazing pizza! The prices are extremely affordable and I will be returning! The location does not having seating so be prepared to stand or take it to go but you will not be disappointment by the taste the fresh ingredients and the assistance provided to us!' u'Amazing amazing pizza!! The marghetta pizza is exceptionally! Cheap eat!! I would not go to expensive diner in nyc. This pizza is worth every cent!!' u'This is the place where my mother purchase the pizzas. I came here several times to buy pizza. Last year after wanting to a job interview I came here to buy pizza myself. The pizza here are usually $1 except for special and premium ones.' u'Loved Kiss my Slice! Their cheese pizza was delicious. We stopped by twice- awesome NYC pizza!' u"I live near the .99 cent pizza place up the block (in actuality around $1.07 since they charge you tax WTF) and I would rather walk the three blocks to this place since this pizza is actually good and the slices are huge! I'm establishing this place as my neighborhood slice-to-go pizza joint!" u"I thought the pizza was delicious-- the specialty slices especially. The pesto and margarita slices were awesome.... It has a good deal for two slices and a can for $5 but I went with specialty slices so with two slices and a can it came out to $9.. I don't mind for some good pizza. He also gave some extra marinara sauce for the crust.They are friendly guys with some good pizza in the hub of midtown... definitely stop in." u"Kiss My Slice \xa0Pizza UNRELIABLE. Pamphlet said they were open until 12 am Ordered a pizza at 11:08 pm. Girl on phone said it would arrive in 30 mins. (11:45)Guy at front desk of Hampton hotel said they were reliable. At 11:59pm \xa0called them back said my order was on the way. Called again at 12:15am no answer. 12:22 still no pizza over an hour wait. Myself my wife and my two young kids go to bed hungry. Don't even bother with Kiss My Slice Pizza. UNRELIABLE \xa0 UNRELIABLE UNRELIABLE." u'Very good pizza timely and tasteful. Pizza done the way it should be!! A big taste for the right price! We even got played napkins crushed red pizza Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning along with it. We will definitely visit the next time aware out and about or just being lazy at home.' u'Best Buffalo Slice ever!!!! And washed it down with a plain slice. Amazing! And the owner Dan was a sweetheart. We will be back for sure.']
101.Tabata,[u"Amazing ramen on a cold day. Place is a little small but you come for the ramen. The sutamina ramen will really hit the spot on a cold day or if you're sick. One complaint: take-out doesn't really work." u'I love this ramen shop it is small and maybe not really original Japanese ramen style but somehow I find it super tasty. My fav is the tan tan men love itMiso ramen and shoyu is ok but tan tan men is their bestI also eat in their second location and the taste can change a little but but not too much' u"One of the better ramen shops that I like in the city. This one also isn't over-hyped and over-priced. I've only been here a handful of times and every time we go my boyfriend and I always order the karaage (Japanese fried chicken). IT IS AMAZING. We usually get the regular ones because spicy food is not a strength of mine.For the ramen I've had the Tabatta ramen tonkatsu ramen and the vegetable ramen. Do not get the vegetable ramen. It's PLAIN. No flavor type of plain. Tabatta ramen is a safe choice though!" u"Total Yum. Delicious Ramen. Well priced. Accommodates vegetarians who don't eat fish - which is not always the case with authentic ramen. Not listed on their online menu but I ordered a ramen with a mushroom based broth with vegetables. It was complete umami goodness. Since I was only here once and on a Saturday I give 4 stars rumor is it can be pretty packed on weekdays especially lunch time. On my visit there were a number of open tables but not empty. The other reason for 4 stars they were out of vegetable dumplings. I substituted with vegetable spring rolls - fresher than I have had before. Finally the music was really loud (and mostly power ballads!)." u'My friend and I went to Tabata on a Sunday evening. \xa0We were seated immediately; the restaurant wasn\'t packed but it wasn\'t empty either. \xa0The place is pretty dive-y. \xa0The people who work at Tabata are SO nice. \xa0Everyone greets you on your way in and says goodbye on the way out. \xa0We really liked our server and everyone else who stopped by our table for one reason or another. \xa0You could tell that they really cared about providing good service. \xa0We ordered two appetizers to split and then we each ordered our own entree. APPETIZERS: SPICY CHICKEN WINGS ($6): 4 relatively large wings. \xa0Not great but not bad either. \xa0The chicken itself is good although a little oily. \xa0The spicy sauce definitely had a kick to it. \xa0The outside of the wings were crispy. \xa0GYOZA ($6): 6 pieces of "pork dumplings". \xa0Was very confused/disappointed by these. \xa0I\'m pretty sure we ended up with some sort of veggie dumpling because the inside was green. \xa0Not sure what exactly happened there. ENTREES: TONKOTSU RAMEN ($10.50): My friend ordered the tonkotsu ramen which had two large pieces of pork sprouts scallions and an egg. \xa0The broth was plain; this was a simple ramen dish. \xa0Not outstanding but not bad either. \xa0Just normal standard ramen.TAN TAN RAMEN ($10.50): I ordered the tan tan ramen which I really enjoyed. \xa0Another simple dish. \xa0I added an egg to it. \xa0It came with ground pork. \xa0I liked this soup. \xa0Overall for the PRICE I think that this is a great value. \xa0Also they will let you take the ramen you don\'t eat to go unlike Ippudo which made me super happy. \xa0Our total bill came to under $40. \xa0 Tabata is a good restaurant for a solid meal that will not blow you out of the water but will definitely leave you feeling full and satisfied - and as an added bonus you probably won\'t max out your credit card here. \xa0I would come back.' u'This place isnt bad at all! I very much enjoyed how we were the first at around 6:30pm then ofcourse after few minutes it started to get crowded!Must try is their fried tofu! Ramen was good too.. but enjoyed the Fried Tofu much more!!BTW... They DO NOT take AMEX!' u'Misleading ratings. Had Miso Ramen super salty as if they had too much miso paste in the broth. The chashu was dried & tasted "old". Ambience was terrible service not there kitchen crew just keep staring at customers...rude. Will not recommend this place for ramen for sure. Disappointed! Spend few more bucks go to Ippudo instead.' u'The inside is not very large as soon as you walk in there is \xa0a counter seating to the right where you can see the kitchen and just a few small table seating to the left. I always like those restaurants that let customers to look into the kitchen. I think that makes them more honest and also they have to keep it rather clean. There is more table seating at the back after you pass the counter with larger tables. Even with all the available seating it is not very big and the space is narrow from front to the back. I believe there was not a single Japanese staff here which is always a bit disappointing at a Japanese restaurant.We started off with hot Green Tea and our waitress told us that the tea is $2 each. Some Japanese restaurants offers green tea for free so it is good to be warned that the green tea is not free here. Their food is pretty good tasty and reasonably priced.At the end of our meal we finished our food content with everything other than service or lack of. We had to ask for refill on water and hot tea a few times and also for the bill. No one really came to check on us while we were there. Then when we tried to pay with credit card we were told "our credit card machine is broken today can you pay (with) cash?" We were so shocked to hear this I mean if they know that their credit card machine is broken shouldn\'t they inform their customers when they come in so that they are prepare at the end of the meal??? We don\'t really carry cash around so we didn\'t have enough cash to pay for the lunch. The waitress simply told us to go an ATM machine. And it happens that it was one of the freezing cold day... My husband had to walk in a cold for like 10 min one way to get cash from our bank ATM which was not pleasant. While I was waiting for him to come back another customer came in and placed a to-go order. As she waited for her food the same waitress brought her a bill. When the lady handed her a credit card once again the waitress told her about their credit card problem and that she needs to pay in cash. The lady was of course shocked told the waitress "ok" and left and never came back. She probably didn\'t want to bother going to find an ATM and walk all the way back in the cold.Very disappointed with the service. Food is still good but not sure if it is worth the negative feeling you are left with after the meal Read my full review of the restaurant and food on my food blog foodlovergirl.' u'Hidden spot near Port Authority. \xa0Their service is fast and there is rarely a wait. \xa0My favorites to get are the Tan Tan Men and agedashi tofu. \xa0The ramen has a large heaping of noodles so I always leave stuffed.' u"Let's me be clear that my two stars are for bad service. The service issue was that the staff did not inform us (their customers or anyone else) that credit cards were not being taken when we arrived until the end of the meal. Normally I love CASH ONLY places because they have some of the best food in NYC but other restaurants would have it posted and you can prepare yourself accordingly.The food and overall experience was four stars if you do not count the service issue and not refilling our waters the entire meal. Tabata has reasonable ramen prices with most items being around $10 or so. To start we ordered green tea ($2) which is reasonable and really hit the spot on a cold day. There was a special for sweet potato tempura which was very delicious. They had a lot of creative takes on ramen which I have not seen at other ramen restaurants. We had the Tabata ramen which has soybean powder and coconut flavored noodle soup and the second ramen was the Dark Men which has black sesame soup including spicy ground pork and scallions. Tabata's owner is originally from Myanmar but he worked in a Japanese Ramen shop in Tokyo. \xa0He worked in the Tabata neighborhood in Tokyo so this is why he calls his restaurant Tabata.Along with the ramen we had some side dishes which were only $5. The fried rice and curry rice were both very tasty. The fried rice tasted exactly like the Japanese-style fried rice that I have had in Tokyo so I would say the owner has done a great job translating the dishes from Tokyo to New York City.I would like to this give this place another try in the future and hope that I have better luck with the service. If you are in Midtown and would like ramen I would try Tabata Ramen with low expectations on service side." u"There are very VERY few reasons why I would ever want to be in Midtown (or even worse near Port Authority) most days but Tabata may be one of the reasons to come back.In a city where ramen is slowly creeping up to prices of $15+ a bowl Tabata is a refreshing cheap and cheerful venue for all your noodle needs. While their classic ramens (shoyu miso tonkotsu etc.) are all very solid you really should come here for their namesake Tabata ramen.It's a mixture of Japanese and southeast Asian flavors with a delicious and creamy coconut milk broth raw red onions and cilantro. It's topped with chunks of a chicken stew instead of traditional pork belly and a soft boiled egg. Everything was perfectly balanced and the noodles had the perfect bit of chewiness to them which is exactly how I like them.They have a $15 credit card minimum which is annoying because most of their meals are $10-$12 but I'm willing to deal for another bowl." u"For starters we got an order of their sweet potato tempura which was made with purple sweet potato. It was nice and piping hot fresh from the fryer and came with a slightly tangy daikon dipping sauce.I ordered the Lava Men and the spiciness was a pleasant surprise because I'd never had ramen that spicy (without having to put in chili powder/oil myself). As expected of a Burmese-run restaurant :) When I was placing my order the waitress asked if I wanted to tone down the heat and I said no. The burn was decent but tolerable. I'd rate the spiciness level a 6/10 and I have pretty good tolerance.Wasn't a huge fan of their soft-boiled egg; while I liked the runniness of the yolk the egg itself had a very slight soapy/chemically taste. Loved the pork - it was tender and fatty and everything I could ask of ramen pork. I had also gotten a small curry rice on the side which was decent but I regretted ordering it because the appetizer + ramen was enough to fill me up. There were some items posted on the walls that weren't in their menus (I think) so be on the look out for those." u"My go-to ramen place! I've never had to wait for a table here and the ramens come out really fast.For appetizers the gyozas are really good because of the paired dipping sauce. I also liked the agedashi tofu. I've tried most of the ramens on the menu and tonkatsu is still my favorite (to be honest I'm not a big fan of the coconut milk tabata ramen). The prices are great ($10-12) and almost every order comes with a flavored egg! I highly recommend the mini gyu-don bowl add-on - it's only $5 and delicious. Make sure to sprinkle the red chili flakes mix condiment they have on the table. It makes all the difference!And if you're in the mood for dessert definitely try the ginger ice cream. It's got candied ginger bits and you get 2 scoops for just $3.Come here for great value fast service and best of all no lines." u'Came here twice with the coworkers for Friday lunches. Their ramen come in decent size bowls and are very flavorful. A tad bit saltier than my usual ramen place on the Upper East Size though.I love their Fried Octopus! Good starter before the steaming Ramen!Please note the restaurant can get crowded and really warm during business lunch hours.' u"We came here for a quick dinner before a show. Service was pleasant and the food was ready in a jiffy. That's all I really ask for in a ramen joint when it comes to service. It was hot and humid out so they had air conditioning on. Thank goodness! I usually don't have ramen in the summer but this was the closest and speediest full service restaurant near the theatre.We had the Tonkotsu and Tabata ramen. When you order a ramen you can order a smaller version of their Gyuu Don ($5) or fried rice ($4) alongside your ramen so we tried both. You cannot order the mini versions on their own it has to be ordered with a ramen. The portion is not as mini as I thought......awesome!!! hahhaha. I had lunch the next day! The portions are nice for the price. The ramen was tasty without being too salty. Some of the more popular ramen joints make their soups unbearably salty. Thank goodnesa it's not like that at Tabata. I thought the seasoning was well done. We really liked Tabata and would in a heartbeat come back if we were in the neighborhood again...even in the summertime! Next time I'll try their cold ramens. I hate 80 temps! It's difficult to have hot ramen when it's over 80 degrees!" u"Low key and no hype; really good price for quality here. A coworker told us the story behind this place - the owner is from Myanmar and learned to make ramen in Japan. Which makes sense as to why some ramen bowls are seem a little less traditional.The restaurant is pretty small but bigger than their 8th ave location. They have bar seating and then a couple tables in the back. We came around 1pm and luckily they had a table open for us.We all got the Sutamina as suggested by a coworker who frequents this place and it was really delicious with a nice kick! I would recommend this over shoyu which I've had at the 8th ave location. We also ordered wings to share - they reminded me of korean style wings which have a harder sweeter shell and very tender meat. Service was good extra points because they were willing to split the bill on three cards for us!I would come back to try the Tabata and the tonkatsu ramen!" u"Came here right after NYCC 2015! WOOT WOOT! This place was pretty good. Had the Tan Tan Men Their wings and fried squid! With good o pitcher of beer! I simply love how they fried their chicken wings! It's nothing really special. But! it's something I appreciate cause not many places fry it like that. As for the squid. I was a little disappointed that it was just mostly tempura batter then squid. Onto the main course! The ramen was good. Broth was just right. Wasn't overly salty at all. The egg was cooked just perfectly where the yolk was Al Dente. I knocked a star down for poor parking area. I would come back again to try their other ramens!" u"Came here for a work lunch friendly staff above average service no frills but convenient for being in the area. I'll come back when I get the ramen craving during lunch." u'Ramen place from down the street of my hotel. Small yet decent. We had the spicy wings shumai and I had Takata Ramen which is their best seller. Highly recommend it' u'Consistently one of my favorite places in midtown west to eat at. Ok maybe not as spectacular as the nearby Ippudo and the like but the lack of wait and crowds makes up for it. Interesting variety of ramen the broth still hits the spot! Kid friendly places we sometimes have our son with us and the waitresses are helpful with a small sip cup and a second bowl to split ramen with him.']
156.Guy’s American Kitchen and Bar,[u"Service was exceptional. Our waiter Jerry was charming and fun. I ordered the Bacon Mac and Cheeseburger expecting a gimmicky mishmash of clashing flavours but was pleasantly surprised by how well it all worked together. The fries were decent but left something to be desired. Portions were plenty big enough so I didn't try an app or dessert. Even at 6pm we got a table for 3 without reservation. Great location fun theme exceptional quality for a decent price." u"Being on a solo work trip I came here by myself to sit at the bar to eat dinner and have a few drinks. AWFUL EXPERIENCE. The bartender seemed to be by himself with having to serve about 25 ppl at the bar on top of taking drink orders from the demanding waiters for their tables. He came up to me not once not twice but THREE separate times to say 'he would be right with me'. Just take my damn order already! I obviously am not invisible and I'm just one person for christ sake. Even the ppl sitting next to me turned and commented how I hadn't been served yet...So then FINALLY the guy takes my order. I order one entree and one drink. Nothing on the side no frills no extras... 10 min later (already about 25 min in) I again get asked my drink order because he couldn't remember. I repeat it - I have been nothing but sweet and nice this whole time (no jerk commentary). Another ten minutes go by and I see nothing but the guy continue to make other people's drinks... Needless to say I ended up walking out. Said goodbye to the nice couple next me. How can you have one person serving at a filled bar on an evening in the theater district?! You nuts!?Also the menu didn't look to extensive as I would have expected from a Food Network star's restaurant ...." u'NOTE: This is a rating based on the happy hour alone! I would never set foot inside this place if I hadn\'t noticed the happy hour sign. It is exactly what some reviews say an obvious tourist trap designed to lure unsuspecting foreigners with an "oh look there\'s the crazy tv guy with the hair let\'s go eat here."With that in mind the happy hour selections are limited but you get a lot for your money. I expected that along with a brand like Guy Fieri would come elevated flavors and it didn\'t disappoint. The basic Buffalo wings wings were some of the best I\'ve ever had and plentiful for the price. The flavored margaritas were great. Removing one star for the mere fact that my gf doesn\'t eat pork I asked if there were any pork products on the nachos they said pepperoni and something I forgot... but they said they could not remove those items from the nachos! Say whaaaa??' u"Service was super fast all 3 times I have been here and they were packed!!!! The garlic/parm French fries are addicting. Amazing and I think I could eat my weight in them. I also love the bbq sliders. Hard to find good bbq in NYC and this is pretty good considering I'm from the south and there is tons of bbq locations at home. Worth the stop. Staff has always also been really quick and friendly." u'31/2 stars and better than I thought it would be. YesI knew this place was a tourist trap. But my 11 year old aspiring chef is obsessed with Guy. We walked by during our last NYC trip and 11 year old has wanted to come here ever since. So in need of a restaurant in the theater district before Hamilton....We had reservations but the place was pretty empty when we arrived at 5. \xa0By the time we left after 6 it was packed. This restaurant is huge encompassing three levels. In between the ground and 1st floor levels you can peek into the open kitchen. The night we went the ground floor was being set up for a huge private event. We sat on the second floor in "the Studio" which had an interesting rock & roll decor. Husband and I started with some cocktails ($13.50 each). My Guy\'s House Margarita was perfect. It went well with the Guy-Italian Nachos. Not a dish I would normally order it was free with Yelp check in. This is an Italian twist on nachos with Italian sausage salami pepperoni piquante peppers ricotta crema. Definitely over the top but will surely fulfill any junk food craving! For an appetizer we also had Bourbon Brown Sugar Wings-sweet ooey gooey. Not the best wings have ever had but pretty good!For my main I had the Sashimi Tacos: \xa0Four crispy wontons stuffed with ahi tuna mango jicama salsa wasabi and sweet soy. Each was a refreshing delicious morsel. This dish is is an appetizer and on the lighter side but perfect after the other heavy apps. Definitely recommend them!11 year old ordered the Bacon Wrapped BBQ Shrimp. \xa0The shrimp was way over cooked and somewhat dry. 11 year old still loved the flavor but I thought the flavor of the BBQ sauce was somewhat pedestrian. 12 year old ordered the Bacon & Chicken Mac & Cheese: Very cheesy Mac & Cheese with diced rotisserie chicken crumbled bacon Parmesan cheese & cheese crackers (yes Goldfish!) Can you say rich? There was not a lot of chicken in this dish and it was a bit dry but the Mac & Cheese was good. Just tasting it I felt like I was eating a million calories. Keeping with the same theme Husband had the Bacon Mac & Cheese Burger. For me there was too much "stuff" on this burger. Maybe all of it was to hide that the burger itself did not have much flavor. Our server was perky and friendly although she seemed a bit green. \xa0To her credit if she did not know something she went to ask. The food came out at a nice pace...with plenty of time to get to the main event Hamilton!!!' u"The food was good figured we would try the place because of the name. The place wasn't busy for a Friday night we got sat right away. The server was awful! She took our order then we didn't see her until well after the food came. Which was bad because I needed dressing for my dish and by the time she came around my food was cold. Then we were ready for a check and she didn't come by. She looked at our table a few times but walked by. I had to go get someone. I expressed how unimpressed we were with her. The host told her and in our line of vision bitched about us and rolled he eyes. She noticed I saw it all then gave me a look and walked away. We are usually great tippers but not this night. Guy might want to hire better staff" u"So it went like this. Apparently my cousin had a good experience here when she came last and wanted me to try the restaurant. BIG MISTAKE! I was quite surprised given that this restaurant was in Times Square and we all know what tourist trap most touristy restaurants are. Well this one turned out just as I expected - maybe my cousin got lucky because looking at the other reviews it seems like our experience was quite similar to most other diners...We got seated and ordered fries for my cousin's baby. A big bowl of a day old fries come before us. We taste them and return. Unfortunately the baby didn't quite agree with our decision and started crying. Babies ya know. So we asked them if they can make the fries fresh and if they can come in a kid's size. The waitress tells us that is the only size they have and yes they could make it fresh. The fries come out much hotter next time but still taste the same...hmmm. Guess they fail at making fries which makes me doubtful of the rest of the stuff. I mean how hard is it to get potatoes right? Yup moving on to the food. We order volcano chicken and Alfredo chicken pasta. The waitress brings the volcano chicken (for moi) first and it's quite average tasting. Chicken is decent so are the mashed potatoes but nothing blows me away or even makes me want to order it again ($22 down the drain). Anyhow my cousin's entree comes and it's not the dish we ordered. The noodles are whole wheat and just like my entree don't taste great. We decided to be smart and cancel our order instead of getting the Alfredo chicken pasta. We also got a plateful of nachos with a Yelp check-in and although we don't care much about nachos we were excited about these cuz of the various pictures and cuz we always welcome free food. The nachos were skimping on everything except for the nacho chips itself. Tiny amount of sour cream cheese and turkey...I mean we get they are free but at least you can make em taste good. What a disappointment! Guy Fieri either doesn't care cuz he's making bank anyways or this restaurant is just another tourist trap giving American food a bad name - and GF for that matter too." u'My friends and I were in town celebrating my birthday and decided to stop by before the Broadway show. This place is amazing! Great food and customer service! No complaints!' u'Gluten Free Review+Gf Patrons look elsewhere unless you love guyNo gluten free menu to start the day off with that at a chef who boasts about the American people but doesn\'t really accommodate patrons with allergies in his own restaurant is a complete let down. They also were out of the gluten-free beer they so provide and get this it was "gluten-reduced" I mean who the heck drinks gluten reduced beer? It has to be gluten free guy hello.Anyways got some truffle fries a super dry chicken that had little to no flavor and a waiter who was decent and got most of the job done but had to check 3 or 4 times with the chef to know what was gluten free. The atmosphere and service and truffle fries were for the 1 star.Not having a gluten-free/allergen menu in NYC is appalling and I\'m quite ashamed this high level of a host/restaurant owner screws us. Will def spread the word to my gluten-free patrons.Get with the program.' u"Oh. My. Goodness. I had the steak diane filet & the bf got guy's cajun chicken alfredo. It was amazing! We both were very pleased. The drinks we got were so good too! Strong just like we like it. He got crazy cab driver and I got the lady liberty cosmo. The bartender was really nice. We stopped by at first for a drink at the bar...looked at the menu and just knew we had to go back for dinner later on that night.My entree.......the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. The potatoes were creamy. The gravy was the icing on the cake for me. I love smothering everything in gravy so I was so happy when my food came out. The cajun chicken alfredo is the best my bf ever had! Def recommend this place!" u"This place is a total tourist trap but the food is good and the beer is better. We had the ahi tuna tacos and the shrimp po'boy. I love how they butterflied the shrimp so it sat nicely on the bread. The ahi tacos had three different sauces and holy crepes! \xa0They were all very tasty. I had Morgan's Red Ale with my sandwich." u"I wasn't completely satisfied with this restaurant. It was a disappointment especially coming into a restaurant from Guy...seriously!! We were seated right away on a Tuesday at 5:00. Our waitress spoke so quietly you had to lean in to hear her! We didn't understand a thing. My dad was excited to see a shrimp po' boy on the menu and quickly decided he was having that. I ordered a signature dish the Huli Huli Chicken Dinner. When our food arrived we dug in. Both my dad and I were very disappointed in the sandwich. It was terrible! Shrimp was too fried not enough sauce and we were hoping for a sloppy mess. The chicken was okay but the presentation made it look better than it was. Good sweet bbq sauce though. Probably not coming back. Such a let down." u'Place was empty but they keep trying to seat us in corners of the restaurant. \xa0Then the Olympics were on TV and then stopped. \xa0The bartender told us Premier League soccer is the Olympics and that is all they will show (not even an American sports league!!). \xa0The best part was the hair in the ice cream of the dessert. \xa0This is NYC - go elsewhere!' u'With all the uber-trendy restaurants in NYC...why you ask did we land at Guy\'s two times in almost two weekends? \xa0Welp I\'ll tell you. \xa0Our "out-of-town" friend says "Let\'s go to Guy\'s! \xa0I love his tv show food and recipes!." \xa0OK not one to crush another foodie or her enthusiasm so we went for it and our experience was so incredible we had to come back with a whole different crew two weekends later.It\'s a pretty big restaurant and can accommodate a ton of peeps so immediately you\'re thinking "oh crap" service is gonna be slow. \xa0Wrong...even when they\'re super slammed (which they were on both occasions) the service was quick friendly and the food and portions were quite adequate and delicious! They\'ve got an extensive "something for everyone" menu drinks are great and while it can get a little too loud the atmosphere is always exciting and vibin\'! \xa0Hey it\'s New York!TIP: \xa0If you\'re a Guy Fieri fan like my friend (and now me!) you\'re probably on to this...he sells his ah-mazing salsa\'s at the grocery store...my fav is the Chipotle!' u"If you like Guy Fieri you will probably like this place because his face and merchandise are plastered all over it. \xa0You are greeted by a wall of merchandise at the entrance. \xa0There are TVs everywhere streaming his shows. Guy! GUY! \xa0buy a frying pan on your way out and hit yourself over the head with it.I went with some coworkers because we work three blocks away and wanted to get inside and see what this place is all about and get some stories to share. \xa0It's about two things: \xa01. \xa0GUY! and 2. tourists who like GUY!Some stories:The menu at least at lunchtime is very underwhelming. \xa0Entrees are chicken chicken chicken ribs steak and a burger that has mac and cheese on it. \xa0I opted for the big dipper which is a french dip type of sandwich. \xa0It was terrible. \xa0Pretty sure that it's deli meat that was heated up and therefore overcooked and chewy. \xa0It has fried onions on it and a yet-to-be-named horseradish sauce. \xa0Guy is probably at home cursing Arby's for trademarking Horsey sauce right now. \xa0I ate less than half of it. \xa0The fries were incredibly greasy. I was so very wrong thinking this was a safe bet. This was $17 and I'd rather have a hero from Subway and pay $17 for it.Service was fine but that's expected when the restaurant is at 25% capacity during the prime lunch rush.Good luck if you want something that doesn't have meat. \xa0There are two things on the menu without meat. \xa0My coworker got a salad sans meat and they didn't increase the portion size for her. \xa0There is a cocktail named after Sammy Hagar.In summary there is a cocktail named after Sammy Hagar." u"The Quick: Definition tourist trap in the Theatre District. The Details: Nothing was awful yet nothing was overly tasty. Overpriced. Not what I'd expect from the guy behind Triple D with usually fantastic hole in the wall recommendations. Small menu. Overall do not recommend. Please note this was not by any means the worst meal I've had it was just mediocre and not worth returning.Damage: Time Square prices." u"So I don't like giving 5 stars but I had no choice. I had the ribs... My wife had the bacon wrapped shrimp with a BBQ sauce glaze. They ribs were perfectly cooked with guys BBQ sauce you could taste the meat not just BBQ sauce. The French fries \xa0were \xa0fresh cut and crispy. If I had one bad thing to say they could have caramelized the sauce on the ribs. Wife loved her shrimp they wrapped it with a very thin peace of bacon in order not to over power the flavor they dipped them in BBQ sauce. The only bad thing but I understand the presentation part to much of the BBQ sauce got on the vegetables. Overall for all the great restaurants in NYC I will definitely be going back and hope they open one in fortlauderdale or Naples Florida." u'We happened to stumble upon this place looking for food as this area has many food options. This is a must visit location. The ambiance is amazing and they are very welcoming. You can sit at the bar area on the first level or the second bar/restaurant area up the stairs. The beers are really good and they have a lot of selections. The food amazing! Great taste and fairly priced for the area. We will be back here on the next NY visit. Also make sure to check in as they have YELP offers.' u'I ironically love Guy Fieri (the man is living his best life) which is why this place gets 3 stars when it really should be 2. The food is overpriced and not good at all. The free nachos you get if you check in on Yelp is probably the best thing. Have tried the huli huli chicken which was just slathered in some sweet sauce and the pork sliders which were again slathered in some sweet sauce. Will I stop watching Diners Drive-Ins & Dives? No. Will I not eat here again? Yes.' u"What was I thinking? My only excuse was I was starving after seeing Beautiful- the Carol King Story. Plain and simple the thought was there but this is a stab at TGI Friday's bar food. Service was horrendous over priced beer even for NYC I seriously can't think of anything positive to say except the play was exceptional!"]
61.The Catalina,[u'Great service! NOTE FOR YELP ORDERS: The order-notification system through Yelp isn\'t quite "prime time" yet. It would be a good idea to call to confirm that your order has been received after placing your order.The standard pizzas are 10 inches. Absolutely delicious! Salad beer dessert also amazing!!A big "thank-you" to the staff tonight!! It was slow (Sunday late night) but all staff were a pleasure to chat it up with especially the bartender from Brazil!!' u'Great sangria tiny yet not cramped excellent "snack" options on their happy hour menu. \xa0My friends and I ordered the margherita pizza and the meatballs and although not incredible still pretty good & worth it for only $7.Giving 3 stars because our service was slow. \xa0Our waiter was super friendly but we only saw him once every 45 minutes or so it seemed. :( I would probably still go back for the sangria pitchers though!' u"After many attempts to try this neighborhood spot my roommate friends and I were finally able to secure a table on a busy Friday night. We were seated in the back and mulled over the drink menu. HH goes from 4-7 so definitely try to make it then. We just missed it so we ordered the specialty summer drinks. About $12 a pop but interesting and refreshing. Each of us ordered a pizza as well (Mushroom Truffle Eggplant and Prosciutto/Sausage). The size is perfect and they came out at the just the right temperature. The staff was friendly and attentive. They promptly came by to take our orders and make sure we were satisfied. The ambiance is cute too. It's tiny like most places in Hell's Kitchen but not so loud that you can't carry on a conversation. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a wood-fire pizza and libations in the area. Can't wait to pop back in for HH." u"I randomly passed by The Catalina one day and thought it looked like a cute neighborhood spot so I came back a few months later to check it out. My three friends and I arrived on a Saturday night for dinner around 6:30 and there happened to be one table left in the back.My friend and I split an eggplant pizza and the penne alla vodka. The pizzas are all personal size and the eggplant pizza also came with mushrooms on top. It was tasty but the crust was a bit too soft for the weight of all the toppings which made the pizza fall apart pretty easily. I really liked the penne alla vodka which came in a little skillet after being baked in their wood oven.The ambiance of The Catalina at dinnertime is dim cozy and not too loud. There are lots of candles on the walls too so it's perfect for a date or intimate dinner! It's a small restaurant and their biggest tables seat four people so I wouldn't come with a bigger group than that. The prices were very affordable for a nice dinner out." u"I am a fan! \xa0 I'm just not even sure where to start. \xa0 This has to be the most inviting staff in the area. \xa0Sat at the bar because I was solo and was not disappointed. \xa0Mario was super attentive and on it! \xa0 Stuck with the basic margarita and a half bottle of Pinot. \xa0Ordered and had my food within 10 minutes. \xa0This pizza was delicious. \xa0Dough was perfectly cooked and chewy but soft. \xa0The tomato sauce was spot on delicious. \xa0Amount of cheese was just right. \xa0 \xa0 This place was great!" u"The Catalina is a super cute place. It's a little on the smaller side as far as space. There's really never a problem getting seats as it never gets crowded. Not the times I've came here at least.  \xa0 \xa0 For me the food is mediocre at best. I've ordered the charcuterie board and I really wasn't pleased with the selections. I've also ordered the 3 dip with their homemade bread. The dips were average as well. Nothing I would come back for. The bread however was really good. Maybe I'll come back to try a flatbread or pizza since I do enjoy their ambience and service. The drinks or good but what I love about this place is the experience. The bartender server and manager are extremely attentive nice and personable people. They really know how to keep their customers happy." u"We were walking up 9th and saw this place checked out the menu outside and decided to try it out. We got the Mediterranean dips-- I liked the hummus but the baba ghanoush wasn't the best. I got the spring salad with chicken the salad the great but the chicken was a little rubbery. My friend got the penne with ricotta he loved it!! Our wine (rose) was delish on a hot day. Would def go back the cocktails looked yummy. Great little spot!" u'Great spot really great decor. Nice selection of drinks on the happy hour menu.' u'This place is kind of amazing. I was looking for a place on a Thursday night that had a happy hour menu good food was in a cute space wouldn\'t break the bank AND located in the midtown west/Hell\'s Kitchen area. I did a quick Yelp search found Bar Catalina met my friends there and WHOA. Done done and done. AND done. After a daunting trek up west 46th street (where the restaurant storefronts don\'t look to promising) you make a turn onto 9th Avenue to get to Bar Catalina walk in the door and you ask yourself "Where am I and how did this adorable gem get here???" It\'s a cozy space and you\'ve got a railroad-style set up going on where the front area has the tables (four tall tables for 4 three tables for 2) behind that is the long lovely bar and behind that is another smaller seating area with a few other tables. The lighting is gorgeous with candles on the tables and elegant lamps over the bar along the wall and a vintage-looking chandelier to boot. The happy hour special is select cocktails and wines for $6 select beers for $5. The menu features tasty-sounding pastas burgers chicken sandwiches and more but everyone in my group was interested in the pizzas (also the recommended option of our server). Without an appetizer a single pizza makes a decent meal for a single not-starving person (depending on the number of toppings). I got the eggplant pizza which also had mushrooms tomatoes ricotta and mozzarella and it was great. I would have said fantastic because the flavors were so good but the pizza\'s super-thin crust couldn\'t quite handle the heft of all the toppings without getting softened. Although I will say I saved one slice for home and when re-crisped in the oven the next day it was definitely better. My dining companions got the pizza margherita the prosciutto di parma and the Catalina. Other than one lukewarm reaction to the margherita the consensus about the deliciousness of the food was strong. And the bill? Drinks for everyone plus the food came to less than $80. Bar Catalina I definitely need you in my life. This will be my new go-to spot for the neighborhood whether just for drinks or dinner. Maybe next time I\'ll ask that my pizza be "extra crispy" and hopefully that\'ll resolve the slight sogginess issue I had.' u"Been to this spot a couple times now for a quiet dinner with drinks. Surprisingly despite the good reviews and tiny locale there are always seats available.Most recent time around shared the Margherita Pizza ($11.50) and Wood Oven Chicken Breast ($17.50). The wood oven pizza is made extremely well with whole tomaotes on top that added to the fresh flavor. The chicken breast is gigantic - huge portion of chicken served with a citrus salad. Juicy meat but it needed some sort of sauce to give it a more balanced flavor. Unfortunately they had no side sauces to provide so I wrapped it up in either salad or pizza instead. To drink we got the house margaritas ($9 each). Very very strong drinks. They do not skimp on the tequila so you get your money's worth there. This place is an excellent spot for a dinner date; as they don't play loud music have good service and great food. Will keep coming back for more pizza." u"First delivery order from this lovely gem! My friend and I ordered a mushroom truffle pie a eggplant veggie pie lamb meatballs and the pickled beet salad with labne. The beets were amazing! The two pies were pretty good but the mushroom truffle was really good. I wasn't to crazy about the meatballs cause they tasted gamey too lamby for me. The delivery was fast the pies were still warm when it arrived. I just wish they would let u order the lemon souffle to go :( Will definitely order again to quell my pizza and beet cravings! Yelp on :)" u"I had high hopes for this place given the great reviews it received. I ordered a pizza and a soda for delivery. After 45 minutes they delivered the pizza just a few blocks away. Unfortunately what should have been a cheese pizza turned out to be a mushroom pizza. I called Catalina and the man who answered the phone was apologetic but said the manager was out and I would have to wait to have this problem fixed. Never heard back. Contacted delivery.com which manages Yelp's online orders apparently and they were able to get the restaurant to send me a new pizza. Well when it arrived it looked like a discombobulated mess. The toppings where right but it looked more like a calzone than a pizza. Never again." u"Move aside Annabel! \xa0Bar Catalina is my favorite tapas pizza and wine spot in Hell's Kitchen. \xa0It's a cute little spot where you could likely have a cute little date as the atmosphere is warm and cozy. \xa0The lighting is dim but not too dim. \xa0Our waiter was very friendly and always checked up on us to see how we were doing. They have several wines and other drinks to choose from but I would recommend ordering a wine here with your tapas and pizza. \xa0Like everyone knows I am allergic to alcohol (sadly) and only ate the food. \xa0We ordered a pizza - prosciutto and sausage - AND IT WAS SO GOOD. \xa0The only other pizza/wine place I'd been to was Annabel and I didn't have as good of an experience there. \xa0The prosciutto and sausage combination was a match made in heaven and the addition of cherry peppers was the cherry (ha!) on top. \xa0The little bit of tanginess and heat from the cherry peppers came together with the meats to make this pizza the bomb diggity. \xa0I'd come back just to have this for a meal.Will definitely be back for the prosciutto/sausage pizza and lovely service." u"Wow... This was a nice surprise. Found Bar Catalina on Seamless and after reading the Yelp reviews I ordered.Food arrived promptly & warm.Arugula Salad with walnuts & blue cheese I added grilled chicken. Dressing a bit salty so I substituted with my own balsamic vinegar & olive oil. Glad I did as the greens were so very fresh with so much taste. Grilled chicken also seasoned was on point!Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger for hubby. The baked onion roll and fresh Avacado was a hit. Chicken Parm was amazing. Chicken was grilled and the sauce... In a word FANTASTIC!!!! \xa0Side of Penne with fresh parsley al dente was just perfect!I'm so happy I've discovered Bar Catalina.Take-out... A GEM!!!!" u"I have been wanting to go here for dinner for some time but i always thought it was more of a bar that did not serve food until I saw their menu posted outside. I started off a few years back as an excellent pizzeria [Zigolini's for those who remember] and then it became a bar and now Bar Catalina. I sat down-they have all high top tables and bar seating. It is a fairly smalI place-I ordered a drink and ordered the Catalina-an individual pie with red sauce mushrooms and spicy sopressata. It came out hot and had just the right amount of kick to it. The waitstaff was pleasant and the pizza [wood fired] came out on a cutting board. It is reasonably priced-one caveat-if you order the Catalina-there is also a drink by the same name so you have to specify if you want the pizza the drink or both. I would recommend and return." u'We ordered the Catalina pizza. It was delicious. The pizza was small but perfectly filling yet light. We ordered a purple rain which was very sweet and tasty. The male wait staff was polite and professional. They even gave us a tasty shot on the house. \xa0It was late at night and a little loud but a fun atmosphere. I would recommend this place to tourists.' u"I randomly walked in with a friend after having told to wait 15 min for a table at another place. This place looked inviting enough and it was! They have good happy hour drink and food specials and we walked in right before 7pm to take advantage! We also ordered off the dinner menu -- in particular the garlic shrimp and beets were good. Good place to go when you don't feel like eating a full meal and just want to share a \xa0few dishes. I found the music loud so I had to shout at times. Don't come expecting quiet romantic ambience." u'Great new spot! Their tequila drink with the edible flower is fabulous! I did not try to eat the flower but it is an interesting concept. We ordered their burrata prosciutto flat bread and the burger that is off the menu. The burrata was so soft and fresh. It was definitely my favorite item of the night. We came when it was not crowded and we were offered a booth of 6 seats just for the 2 of us so we had plenty of room.' u"OMG that mushroom truffle pizza. \xa0Just get it. \xa0Just do it. \xa0And don't share. Sangria is good too - 2 for 1 specials on certain nights." u'If you\'re reading this review cause you\'re on the fence about trying out Bar Catalina - my recommendation is to just go for it. It is probably one of the best spots around Hell\'s Kitchen.Whenever I pass by Bar Catalina always seems to be busy but not overwhelmingly so. I came here on a Saturday night and felt genuinely welcomed by the staff. They were very warm and I immediately felt comfortable.I got the recommended "The Catalina" with pear vodka and edible flower. The first sip blew me away cause it was a lot better than I expected! Don\'t want to overhype but highly highly suggest getting this. It was strong but I could not tell there was vodka; a little bit foamy and sweet but not too sweet; very enjoyable to sip on. I ate the edible flower .... it just tasted like flower.Prices are maybe a little more expensive than the rest of Hell\'s Kitchen but for the quality and craft of the cocktails the timely service (they were so good at refilling water cups) and chill and non-pretentious atmosphere it\'s worth shelling out the couple dollars for sure.As an added star they brought out complimentary lemon ricotta cheesecake for everyone in the bar to try! It was delicious... They said they\'re testing out a new item so if you see it on the menu sometime - I recommended it first!I can\'t wait to tell my roommates to try this place and have a spot to impress out-of-towners :)']
28.B Side Pizza & Wine Bar,[u"I know yet another pizza place but this place is good! The pizzas are delicious and they come out quick and hot. All the varieties they have were so good that we had to order two more pies. The pies are a little bigger than personal pan size so two pizzas for two people will leave you with left overs unless you eat the way I do :) Service was outstanding. I came late to the party but they got me a setting and some water quick. Overall I'm in love with this place and will definitely be coming back. Great place if you need something quick for lunch but not take out quick. Give them a try!" u"New York City is filled with pizza everywhere. You can find $1 slice pizza almost at every corner. But if you are looking for a high quality unique and/or super delicious pizza that is a different story. Inside is a bit small but not too small with around 40 seats of that mainly counter seats. The entrance wall is covered with large windows so it is nice and bright with natural lights. They have their own oven used to bake yummy pizzas. I heard that at the B Square location they are not allowed to have the wood fired oven due to NYC building restriction therefore B Side naturally have the superior pizza.Their pizzas are all just one size and no slices. You get a beautifully crafted pizza pie which is just the right size to share among two people. Their pizza and dessert was just amazing and very high quality super delicious!!!The staff (who I assume was also the manager) was really nice and friendly he answered all of our questions and took a very good care of us. It was a really great lunch and I can't wait to go back for some more of their amazing pizza creations! Read my full review of the restaurant and food on my food blog foodlovergirl." u"I've been here 3 times now and had a vastly different my third time. I loved the meatball appetizer and the killer bee pizza the first two times with lots of wine. The most recent visit had only one glass of wine and more menu exploring (spicoli pizza and roasted avocado appetizer) which honestly tasted undercooked. The tastes severely clashed and I ended up not finishing a single thing I ordered. Go if you want the wine in a cool modern place but the sober food is a huge turn off." u'This high top hangout is a cute date spot with small groups and probably the best pizza in NYC. We love Marta but this is comparable without the price tag or pretentious crowd. We tried the two meat heaven pizzas below:El puerco loco - mozzarella pancetta taleggio Parmesan pork sausage pickled chilesKiller bee - mozzarella sopressata garlic puree Chile oil honey. OMG AMAZING!Crust was flavorful itself and I never eat the crusts. The woodfire oven char hit the spot without overpowering the flavors. The tomato base was sweet and fresh. We will be back to try all others. Delicious !' u"Bottom line: The pizza here is great! This place serves up some inventive thin crust pizzas that retain some of the classic flavors we all know and love. We shared the Killer Bee and El Puerco Loco. The Killer Bee has tomato mozz sopressata garlic puree chili oil and honey. The honey is the X-factor here. The sweetness of the honey helps balance out the saltiness of the rest of the ingredients.El Puerco Loco is made up of tomato mozz pancetta taleggio parmesan pork sausage and pickled chiles. This one is relatively classic in terms of flavor and quite delicious.The also have a great rotating craft beer selection at $7 each. Too bad this place is on the small side or else I'd invite all my friends to come feast here with me. It seems that B Side has quickly become a neighborhood favorite so expect to wait a bit if you come on the weekends. This place is perfect for a casual date - it's a small space that's best suited for groups of 2-4." u"I'm back home in Las Vegas thinking about the wonderful food we enjoyed at Bside. \xa0The Killer bee was our first and it had it all. \xa0Spicy sweetness and Sopressaya muuuah. The Black Kale salad Devine could not be made any better. Do you grill the kale? \xa0After our A+ first impression we couldn't have pizza anywhere else. So we didn't. Gracious and accomodating servers Overall this place is an A+" u"I've had a fascination with pizza since I was a kid. A real issue if you ask me. Everyone claims to have good pizza but is it really good? I'm from North Jersey so I know what real pizza tastes like. Considering that most places in NYC actually suck when it comes to pizza this place stood out.I ordered El Puerco Loco (Spanish for Crazy Pig) with tomato mozzarella pancetta taleggio parmesan pork sausage and pickled chiles. My god I may have hit the jackpot in NYC: it was delicious! \xa0The pizza was filling without it being heavy. They put the perfect amount of sauce (I hate soggy pizza) and right amount of toppings. The crust was perfect doughy enough without it being too thick and chewy. The chiles added just enough heat without making it overbearing. Paired that with a nice glass of rose and I was set!The inside was very cute and the staff was super attentive to our needs making sure that our pizza was on point and the glass of rose never empty.Glad I discovered this place and wouldn't hesitate to come back anytime soon." u"Cute place with solid menu. \xa0When we went last night there were only appetizers and pizza I didn't see salads or other options. \xa0But the marge pizza was solid and worth going back for. \xa0The burrata with melons was also REALLY good and seemingly one of the healthier options. \xa0The roasted Brussel sprouts were good but tasted a little too meaty for my like. \xa0Note there is only beer and wine no full bar. \xa0Definitely worth checking out!" u'My top recommendation for restaurants to go to in Hells Kitchen! I take all my friends here. The Zucchini "Noodles" Salad Killer Bee and Budino are the best!!! Service is also amazing we always eat at the bar.' u'Holy shit balls. This place:The starters light and fresh. The meat feast pizza is nothing short of a mouthgasm of the highest order. \xa0The freshest of ingredients compliment each other in a vicious manner leaving your taste buds spent and shaking in the corner. \xa0The smoky flavouring and the delicate crust will leave you begging for more. The Parmesan finish adds another level to pure heaven.Special mention to the servers for being extremely courteous and helpful and going above and beyond to help plan the perfect week. \xa0The level of care and attention we received left us feeling loved. The open face of the bar is a people watchers dream and the music offers an ambiance of cool that could melt the coldest of hearts.I thoroughly unashamedly wholeheartedly confess that this was in fact the best pizza I have ever eaten in 35 years on this planet. Phe-Nomi-Nomi-nal.' u'The Killer Bee pie is some of the best pizza I\'ve ever had. Literally AMAZING. It\'s an absolute must if you come here. I came here to grab dinner with my cousin. Since all of the pies are 12" (six slices) we were going to get one to split and then a few appetizers on the side. However none of the appetizers were really too appealing to us so we decided to go big and get two pies to share. We got the Killer Bee and the Spigoli but I wish we had gotten two of the Killer Bee! So freakin\' good. The Spigoli was good too but nothing compares to the Bee. It\'s apparently their most popular pie.On another note this spot is so so cute. It\'s very intimate and offers an authentic NYC pizza experience!' u'I was craving some NYC style pizza and decided to check this place out based on all the Yelp reviews and I must say it did not disappoint! The place has a cool rustic feel with wooden tables and seating. The pizzas are cooked in front of your face (depending on where you sit) in a brick oven. We ordered The Guido which consisted of the traditional sauce and mozzarella cheese as well as a garlic sauce green olives tomato sopressata and peppers. The pizza was delicious! The garlic sauce mixed in with the regular sauce paired so great with the rest of the ingredients. Everything was fresh and perfectly cooked. The service was great. The waiter was helpful and friendly and our food came quickly. I would definitely return to this place to try the Honey B!' u"We got 2 pizzas for take out: the Margarita pizza and the Spicoli.Food: It was pretty good. It's a thin pizza. Not a huge fan of the crust because it was a pretty large portion of the pizza and really hard (crispy) which I'm not a huge fan of. I personally didn't like the Spicoli but if you like a lot of mushrooms and onions you'll like it.Interior: It's cute and airy. They open the window walls facing the street when the weather is nice so it feels fresh. The store is too crowded (7pm on a weekday) though and it's hard to get to any table without bumping into someone. You also need to track down a waiter yourself if you want to put your name down for a table.Service: We ended up having to wait longer than we were told for our pizzas and the waiter wasn't very friendly or helpful. It seemed like they only had one waiter at 7pm and one bartender for the whole restaurant. We had to ask for our pizzas multiple times even after we saw it was ready and sitting in a box on the counter. While we were there there was a group that had been waiting for a table longer than they were told that asked how much longer it would take. When asked the waiter used swear words to describe how slow the customer at a certain table was eating and blamed it on them. This is unprofessional no matter what. Will probably be back to try the food in the restaurant but want to try somewhere else for takeout pizza next time." u'This pizza is SO GOOD!!! Definitely the best pizza in the area and probably the best in NYC. Even the crust is good!Always comforting to come to this gem always leave way to full and happy. You should get the Killer Bee and Spicoli.' u'My family and I were dying for a New York style specialty pizza for lunch. \xa0We decided to walk over from Times Square and give B Side Pizza & Wine Bar a try. \xa0We absolutely loved it! \xa0It was such a fun and charming restaurant! \xa0Plus there was a sign outside that said "Walk-ins Welcome" with a picture of Christopher Walkin. \xa0I enjoyed it.I expected it to be a traditional New York pizza place with a display counter of different slices which I love. \xa0However I was very surprised when we walked in! \xa0It is a sit down restaurant! \xa0It is well lit and quite nicely decorated. \xa0I loved the layout! \xa0There is a full bar and brick pizza oven in the center of the restaurant surrounded by \xa0a marble top bar. \xa0There are also a bunch of high top tables with hard wood booth seating. \xa0The ceiling lights are also super cute!The menu is awesome- so many specialty pizzas appetizers salads desserts and a great cocktail/wine menu! \xa0We started with the Crushed Fingerling Potatoes with pancetta scallions and creme fraiche. \xa0They were so good! \xa0We ate them like potato chips.As our entrees we split three specialty pizza pies. \xa0It was VERY difficult deciding which three to order because they all sounded so good and unique! \xa0We ended up ordering "The Muscles From:" (brussel sprout leaves pancetta ricotta garlic topped with a fried egg) the "You Got a Lot\' a Balls:" (tomato mozzarella meatballs oregano &peppers) \xa0and the "Killer Bee:" (tomato mozzarella sopressata garlic puree chili oil and honey). \xa0All three were delicious- perfect New York crust! \xa0I did slightly prefer the Killer Bee. \xa0The honey drizzled on top was absolutely delicious.It is definitely one of my favorite pizza places I\'ve ever been to. \xa0I would definitely go back to try the other pies. \xa0Plus who doesn\'t love a good glass of wine with their pizza?' u"Places to return to!Really tasty Pizza. The salad was fresh appeared simple but it was very well prepared! I didn't really care for my dessert but my friends Tiramisu was so good! The industrial-cozy decor of the place is cool and the lighting was inviting that cold evening." u"The pizza here was fantastic and I'd definitely recommend to others and return here another time. The staff was also great. We tried The Guido and I was a bit worried because it said it had peppers on it and I am nto a big fan of bell peppers. These were fine though! Not too many of them and not overpowering. I don't normally eat my crust unless it's really good and I found myself eating the crust here -- so much so that I couldn't even fit a full beer in afterward because I was so full lol.Thumbs up!" u"Now granted most things taste great when you've had some alcohol but this pizza was something to write home about. The crust was fantastic; a great crunch with every bite. We ordered the Don Ho which had prosciutto and pineapple a real good twist to the OG pineapple and ham. The mozerella was fresh and not too overpowering. A fancy pizza in New York. A good choice if you're looking for something different from the street pie." u"This place is aaaaawesome! Fantastic pizza. No really I mean FANTASTIC! And the two guys who were working this afternoon couldn't have been nicer!!! This is going to be my new go-to place from now on whenever I'm going to see a show in midtown!" u'It is OK. I was expecting more given the high reviews in the area. Good coal oven pizza. I would recommend the pizza with honey (Killer Bee I believe) it is a weird combination but it goes well together. I would \xa0come back if I need to eat in the area. The wait to get in is LONG though']
174.Moshe’s Falafel,[u'My father used to take me here when i was a little kid. This place is the real deal. It is without a shadow of a doubt the best falafel i have ever had in my life!That is all' u'I know. Here I am giving two stars to this old staple of the New York City falafel stack. But really objectively: it\'s not very good. And it\'s not a simple verdict either. I have a lot of respect for the old guard of New York Jewish food. Russ and his daughters blow my mind. I love Eisenberg\'s. But Katz\'s? Fun and completely overrated. Moshe\'s is a relic and while I savor the old grumpy curmudgeonly sense of humor the food is made with sub-par ingredients and has been outpaced by many neighboring falafel carts. Should you try it once? Yes. You might like it a lot more than me. The falafel itself is pretty good with a great outer crisp. I loved the old school little foil wrapper of slender pickles. But the "salad" is soggy and gross the hot sauce is just a flavor-less anus exploder and the tahini is meh. The fries are every street cart fries you\'ve ever had. It\'s cheap though. And the guys working there are hysterically stressful and pushy. For a certain type this is comfort food. For me it\'s not a lunch I\'ll want to repeat.' u"Nice little food truck that appears to have home base at 46th and 6th. The truck offers the standard array of falafel dishes (pita or platter or straight-up ballin). Today I opted for a whole falafel sandwich with whole wheat pita (that option is always a big plus factor to me). \xa0The falafel ball itself is pretty decent not oily but I think I wanted a bit more of a crunch. \xa0The sandwich comes topped with several thick cut fries and some mini-dill pickles. The fries are actually pretty damn good. \xa0The sandwiches come with tachina (tahini in non tribespeak) and hot sauce - the tachina is pretty decent as well.Might not be on par with Mamoun's TA\xcfM or Cafe Azuri but it's quick fresh whole wheated and pretty good." u"My go to cart when I'm in the neighborhood for hot crunchy hint of cumin laced deliciously fried to perfection chickpea balls!! Come on people 6 piping hot balls for less than $4 that are accompanied by some amazing briney Israeli pickles a generous container of tahini sauce and a super spicy and incredibly mouth watering pepper hot sauce to dip in it's a meal fit for any vegetarian kosher royalty! They also offer hot soup and the falafels are also served the traditional in a pocket pita with whatever fixings you desire as well. The staff is super friendly and accommodating when you ask for extra sauce and the cart is there rain or shine closer to 6th on 46th (minus shabbos/shabbat or however you know it as)Truly a gem in the food cart foodie category!" u'UghHad their 6 falal combo.Disappointed but the owner is pretty nice.I wish I could lie and give a 4 stars.ButI cannotI am a good person with a pure heart pursuing for foodAnd the taste of the food here is - ugh come on!Along with the cheap priceI may be less unhappyStillI am disappointed.' u"Moshe's is located on the southeast corner of 46th and 6th (aka Avenue of the Americas). \xa0It's a food cart located on a street with tons of other food carts. \xa0Best to get here earlier to avoid crowds and wait times.I ordered the whole sandwich which comes with fries. \xa0Not sure if the half comes with fries... not sure what the half even is.If you're looking for a sandwich that isn't your typical cold cuts between two slices of bread this is it. \xa0Moshe's falafel sandwich is filling and quite satisfying at the same time. \xa0I've definitely had better falafel sandwiches (i.e. Mamoun's Falafel Taim) but in Midtown this truck is pretty much the place to go for your falafel fix. \xa0The falafel isn't as flavorful as somewhere else and it is a little less crispy on the outside but they are huge and along with the tahini and hot sauce (it's not that spicy) it's pretty tasty. \xa0There's a pickle and the usual tomato and lettuce in the sandwich as well.The great addition here is the fries. \xa0They're actually delicious to my surprise. \xa0After a 7 block walk I thought these things would be soggy but they actually stayed crispy and were delicious with the tahini and hot sauce.Falafel sandwiches are something I don't eat often because for me they are delicious when I eat them but afterwards I feel kind of gross for some reason. \xa0However to each their own and if you're in Midtown and love your falafel sandwiches everyday or once every couple months like me Moshe's is a solid pick." u"Finally encountered Moshe's food truck on 46th @ 6th Ave. Got the large falafel with the works. Huge sandwich loaded with crispy falafel Israeli salad pickles fries lettuce tahini and hot sauce. Very glad I found them." u"Easily top 3 Falafel I've ever had...and the other 2 were from Israel. Best Falafel in NYC." u"I have to say Moshe's Falafel is definitely one of my favorite places to get take out around mid-town. \xa0Located on 46th and 6th right by the Citibank there's a consistent long line of patrons waiting to purchase Falafel sandwiches.For about $7 it is quite a bargain and they really do fill you up. \xa0I always order the Whole which is a sandwich stuffed with fresh falafell lettuce tomatoes a pickle and topped with 3-4 large cut french fries.Many places double fry or over fry their falafels but you can tell these are always fresh by how light and fluffy they are. \xa0I don't know if I can order any other falafel's except Moshe's." u"When it comes to street carts I try to keep my expectations low -- because as any New Yorker will agree they are hit or miss. Moshe's is a hit - \xa0serving great tasting fresh falafel that is not incredibly greasy like many others. They change their oil frequently which is important. I find myself visiting Moshe's for a quick bite during lenten fridays (no meat) but also other times as well. My order has always been the 1/2 pita ($5.75 - just raised prices). It is plenty of food for me especially since they will often give you a falafel to munch on while you wait. I always request the sauce (sesame & hot) on the side so it does not get soggy. If you work in the area give Moshe's a try!" u"I am not hating on this falafel. \xa0Never greasy still moist yet crunchy cheap lightly coated in tahini (if you want it to be) and easy to walk and eat - it's a thing I like to do in the city. \xa0It's hard and I do mean HARD to find good falafel in Manhattan whether it be a restaurant or a stand. HARD! \xa0But Moshe's definitely hooks it up for the $4 a little plate of satisfying falafel balls." u'This is an amazing food truck that provides the best falafel in Manhattan! \xa0Line is always long but moves fast. Has been around for decades and still a treat!' u"OK and that's all. Had better falafel in the city. Not much to report. If you pass by and hungry consider making the line. Not worth walking specially t there. The falafel was on the bland side and the salad not properly dressed. As I said OK and that's all." u"The men working in this little cart/truck are friendly folks. Big grins while they work next to a hot stove on a summer day takes real fortitude. I had the falafel sandwich. It was humongous heavy in all the right places and I must say those are some great falafel balls. So even though it's a bit pricy rest assured you're getting your money's worth as much as it's worth here in NYC. Next door are a bunch of other food trucks that charge about $10 or more for a sandwich pizza schnitzel what have you. So I was satisfied with my purchase. I asked for a lot of tahini sauce. Did they charge me extra? No because they are awesome. The falafel sandwich definitely more than fills you up. I was so stuffed. Between the pita bread next to the falafels are your typical tomato and lettuce salad but then you get a bunch of French fries that cover the top and a singular long mild pickle. I was surprised. Pleasantly surprised. What a twist on a classic falafel!" u"I'm NOT a vegetarian but this was pretty dang good for a vegetarian meal.Stopped by the truck on 46th/6th ave and got the Whole-Falafel sandwich - $7.75The pita was PACKED with veggies sauce and plenty of falafel. Also you can choose to have it topped with fries for free if you want. The falafels were pretty good and the fries were nice and crispy. The sandwich was VERY big too which is a plus. Not many places you can find a quality sandwich for under $8." u'Read all the way to the end to understand why I gave this ratingWalking to lunch the options were mediocre (long lines / B restaurant) when I happened to find this truck. They had a long line which gave me a clue THIS FOOD MUST BE GOOD.Got in line and got served in 7 minutes. They had to stall us for preparing more falafel which is understandable given the demand. A young man asked for and prepared my order and an old man took my money.Then he turned and talked with his friend and "forgot" I was waiting for change.When he did notice I wasn\'t leaving because HE OWES ME MONEY he handed it with the half-hearted apology and a smile.Quick to take your money slow to deliver change gets you a less than mediocre rating.' u"I have to have their falafel every time I'm in NYC! Their pita falafel sandwich is the best!! Remember to get extra tahini sauce!" u"I reallyyyy wanted to love this place. ever since returning from Israel last year I've been craving good falafel. Moshe's is a few blocks from the office and had good reviews so I figured I'd walk over and give it a try. unfortunately the walk was the best part. the food truck staff were friendly enough but the falafel itself was disappointing. I ordered the falafel pita (layered with falafel lettuce tomato cucumber french fries more falafel and a pickle). the pita was dry and bland the veggies were fresh but the lettuce was still wet. the fries were greasy and unseasoned. worst of all the falafel was incredibly bland. the texture was decent but there was no flavor just mush. the tahina was another layer of bland. even the hot sauce was barely flavorful. overall a giant portion of bland-on-bland which landed itself in the trash after a few bites. womp womppp." u"Where do I begin? Do I start with the cheap price? Do I start by saying how each batch of falafels are fresh and crisp? Or do I start by saying they put fries in their sandwich? Heck I think all of them are a good start.It's been over a year and each time I pass by I always regret not getting their falafel sandwich until today. Everything made sense after the first bite. Whether it be the fries the crispyness of the falafel balls or price this is a lunch establishment to be reckon with. Don't let the long lines stop you from ordering it's moves at a good pace. =)" u'its great. best falafel in manhattan.']
76.Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steak House,[u'Cant believe i forgot to put their review so i can rem. I love here sooo much.I think here was the best steak house in town overall.If someone dont like the steaks here  i strongly recommend that person should become a vegetarian. Cuz he/she dont kno how to appreciate cows lives' u"Great meal and best stake I've ever had!! Visited New York for the first time and this place had my heart with there delicious meal! We came here twice during our stay to the city and has never been disappointed.We both tried the cowboy steak and wagyo long bone steak and were both perfection thou the wagyo long bone steak top it off.. We also had a cauliflower gratin and creamed spinach on the sides we really enjoyed our meal every time. Highly recommend and I would definitely come back to this place if I'll visit the city again!" u"BEST STEAK I HAD IN NYC! Now that i have your attention Del Frisco's (Double Eagle) is amazing! I came here on a Friday night with my date. I made reservation for 7 pm. We meet the hostess at 6:55pm indicated our reservation and then were quickly seated. I must note that the service is just incredible! The staff at Del Frisco's made you feel like you had a whole team of people looking after you. It was amazing! \xa0Our waitress was great and gave up numerous recommendations. After placing our order she checked on us several times to insure that we were ok and to see if we needed anything. When our steaks came out (15-20 minutes later) the servers requested that we cut our steaks in half to insure that the steaks were cooked properly and to our satisfaction. As for the flavors of the steak it was just amazing! It was s0000o good! I highly recommend anyone in the area looking for amazing steak to try Del Frisco Double Eagle Steak House. I would rate Del Frisco Double Eagle Steak House as follows: Steak 5 Stars Service 5 Stars Price is 4 Stars and Atmosphere is 5 Stars. P.S: It should be noted that the steaks run about $63-$70 each. Drinks are around $15-20 each.The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment." u'Living in LA my boyfriend and I have always talked about celebrating our anniversary in NYC the next time we were in town and we finally had the opportunity to do that recently! With so many restaurants to choose from looking at Yelp reviews and getting recommendations from family that live in Jersey City we finally nailed it down to this place. \xa0We celebrated our anniversary on a Wed night so I was thinking it would be a slower night but it was busy! All of the food was delicious! The crab cake is a must especially! Service was excellent and also got a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.' u'Big fancy steakhouse in the heart of midtown! I was debating between this and a few other steakhouses as a place to celebrate my boyfriend\'s birthday. I ended up choosing this based on a friend\'s positive recommendation.The restaurant definitely has an upscale field to it. From the high ceilings to the numerous diners in business suits it makes a statement. My boyfriend and I both 24 were probably the youngest diners by quite a few years.We got a VIP cocktail to share ($18) and the waitress let us split it between two glasses. Then she came back with two pretty much full-sized cocktails and said "the bartender accidentally poured too much!" with a wink. Lucky for us the cocktail was really good and super pineapple-y.For our appetizer we had the crab cake - sooo good. At $24 it was definitely pricey for the portion but it lives up to its reputation as the best crab cake in New York. Big chunks of meat super flavorful super tender.Then I had the filet medallions and my boyfriend had the bone in rib eye. I really enjoyed mine. It came with 3 small pieces of super soft and pleasantly chewy filet mignon as well as mashed potatoes and string beans. The ribeye also had a great flavor but was a bit over cooked. The waiter had told us "medium" has pink in the middle but ours was pretty cooked through except for some parts near the bone (those were mouthwatering-ly good though especially with the fat ugh so amazing). If only the whole thing could\'ve been done like that. The waitress also told us about sauces that the meat came with and each unfortunately comes with an extra charge. We didn\'t end up getting any and were also wondering why they didn\'t list them on their menu which would have been way more efficient than listening to (and forgetting) all the options. Brussels sprouts were not great. Tasted rather burnt and dried out.At the end we decided to skip on dessert. However the waitress came out with a huge slice of their lemon cake and told us it was on the house! She even came back with a candle after I told her it happened to be my boyfriend\'s birthday. Overall it was a great experience dining at Del Frisco\'s. I wouldn\'t give it a perfect rating though mainly due to the fact that the steaks weren\'t that mind blowing though they came with a hefty (i mean HEFTY) price tag. My boyfriend liked Wolfgang\'s better and I found Peter Luger to be slightly better as well.' u'Took my husband here for his birthday... I dropped a car note on dinner and let metell you it was worth EVERY penny. The meal was amazing from start to finish our server was attentive without being overbearing and the ambiance and view from our booth tied the experience together. Our meal from start to finish was filling and delicious our drinks were strong! For a special occasion or splurge night out this is the place to dine' u"Came here on a Saturday night and sat on their patio. Ordered the VIP cocktail. Vodka infused with pineapple. This drink is dangerous!! \xa0So smooth and all vodka. For an app we got the crab cake one of the best I've had. Mostly all high quality crab no bread crumbs served on top of a red saffron sauce that was amazing. Main course was one of their most popular dishes bone in filet. I was unfortunately let down. Ordered it medium and it was dry a little tough and not well crusted or seasoned. It was also very fatty around the bone. \xa0Not was you want to see or eat if you're a filet mignon girl. \xa0You obviously prefer the leanest of the lean so there's a conflict of interest here. \xa0I would not recommend this cut to someone who is looking for a lean cut. \xa0Also ordered the lobster Mac n' cheese. This was ok. Tasted more like a cream sauce than cheese. Had high hopes for this place. Service was great though. Fast efficient friendly water glass was always full kind of service. Pricey $300 bill for two people." u"Great steakhouse.For appetizers tried the oysters (East & West coast; very fresh) crab cake (excellent mostly crab meat) and the Del's salad (excellent; loved the avocado dressing).For main tried the bone-in prime ribeye (22 oz; excellent) and lobster tail (very good). You can order from 12 oz up to 22 oz for the lobster tail but very expensive. My 18 oz was $108. Ouch!Sides: Onion rings (very good; give you a lot) & baked potato (excellent).Desserts: \xa0Butter cake w/ caramel sauce/pecan ice cream (Excellent - this one easily feeds 2-3 ppl) and seasonal berries. Loved their whipped cream made-in-house.Excellent service (Many thanks to Paul L for recommending many great dishes as well as the wine.): 9 calendars" u'Terrific as always. \xa0The service quality of the food and the atmosphere make this a complete steakhouse PLUS experience!! \xa0The staff were accommodating to us and created a crab cocktail that was sea fresh as well as the ghouls salad with light dressing. \xa0Great startThe steaks were perfectly cooked at medium rare with the red center and tenderness at a primo level. \xa0One of the best steaks ever!Will be back.' u"Finally came here after much discussion. Very cooperate feeling steakhouse. Grand ceilings dark wood columns and trims. Truly an open space feeling with two floors of seating space. We made reservations and upon arrival were seating immediately. I really like it when a steakhouse has female waitresses and Del Frisco's hires female waitresses. Our waitress was very informative and patient with our ordering. They have an extensive wine book that required some time to sort through and she walked us through it. She allowed us to have some tastings and we ultimately picked a bottle that she suggested. For food we ordered the following:Apps: 10oz bacon and crab cake The bacon was thick cut and topped with red chili's - amazing. I would definitely order this is you typically order sliced bacon at other steakhouses because the thickness of the bacon is a real game changer. The sauce they marinate it in is also very tasty. The chili's give it a real kick but not too spicy where its intolerable. Entree: Wagyu tomahawk chop and bone in prime rib eye; both cooked medium rare. FANTASTIC. This is the only steakhouse where the steak comes out piping hot - LIKE PIPING FREAKING HOT. Yet still cooked to the perfect temperature. Dessert: Banana bread pudding with vanilla ice cream - very good but also very filling and enough to share for two. Side note: Our wine was decanted and while she was topping my glass off she accidentally spilled it all over and immediately apologized (probably said sorry 5x). She even had our table linen changed and brought us all new silverware and plates. I was a little upset at the fact our wine was spilled because it was so expensive. However she was nice enough to comp our dessert so that made up for it. Our bill came up to about $405 for two people. This steakhouse is one of the more expensive ones in the NYC. I would definitely come here if you've never been but make sure you are ready to spend =P. Can't wait to come back!" u"Had to send my bone-in steak back twice. Ordered it medium and it came back well done both times. Finally got it right the third time. Third time's a charm. Our waiter Jed was super professional and wasn't satisfied until my steak was just how I ordered it. He comped my steak and gave us extra sides and free dessert. He took really great care of us.Steak was great perfectly seasoned. Hoped for a little more char on the crust but the flavor was still there. First time I came here the steak was perfectly cooked and was outstanding. This time it wasn't as good hence the 4 star review.King crab gnocchi melts in your mouth. Super rich and very low calorie ;)Corn marque choux was my favorite side dish for sure. It's a creamed corn but not thick and creamy which was nice. Really good flavor.Asparagus with almonds is refreshing when everything else is covered in butter. Added a nice refreshing element to an otherwise heavy meal." u"Del Frisco's Steak House is an ideal spot for a date especially for the steak lovers. From the fancy exterior and spacious interior the venue is sure to impress; you probably have walked past Del Frisco's on several occasions as its near Radio City and Magnolia's but you don't actually know it's Del Frisco's unless you're actually looking to dine there. Many debate between Del Frisco's and Peter Luger as being NY's best steak house. Having dined at both I can say that Del Frisco's hands down serves the best steak in town. Not only is the service 10x better than Peter Luger (as in there's actually service here) but the steaks are seasoned with the right amount of salt and pepper here; neither my friend and I had the urge to ask for steak sauce - the epitome of a good steak when it tastes good as is. I'm not even a steak fan and I managed to finish my 12 oz fillet mignon! My friend had the rib eye which was equally as delicious. Our only compliant for the rib eye was that some corners were too fatty but it wasn't too much so not that big of a deal. For our side we shared the lobster Mac and cheese as we noticed this was the go to side via Yelp. Prior to the steaks and lobster Mac and cheese we started with the acclaimed crab cake. Definitely pricy at $24.50 for one crab cake but hey you're dining at a pricy establishment so yolo right? Good news is that it was the best crab cake we've had as it was legitimately all crab with very little filler. The bread wasn't anything special - your standard sesame white bread loaf; it was soft though. All of the staff understands the amount you pay as the service here represents that quality. Our waters were never empty. But most importantly once your steak is delivered to your table they have you cut into it to ensure that it was cooked to the temperature you asked for; they even hold up a mini flashlight to confirm the color. Unfortunately our first steaks were overcooked and had to be sent back - they even take back the side too because they want the entire meal to be served together. However because of this mishap they upgraded my fillet mignon from 8 oz to 12 oz! Definitely worth the splurge as this was the best steak I've ever had." u"I had the best meal of my life here! \xa0We came with family to celebrate and our waiter and the restaurant made it so special. From the outside the restaurant doesn't look like much but when you walk in it's beautiful. There are two floors and the entire restaurant is surrounded by massive glass windows. You feel like you are outside even though you're inside. The second floor has a balcony feel where you overlook the downstairs area and where you can look out onto the streets of New York. The food is absolutely incredible. We all ordered different things and loved every bite. For appetizers try the bacon. For a side dish we shared the crab gnocchi and lobster macaroni. Of the two delicious options the gnocchi was my favorite. For an entree every single thing is delicious. I had the fish over crab fried rice and it was to die for. For dessert we all loved the butter pecan pound cake with butter pecan ice cream and caramel. It truly was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Our experience here was so memorable mainly because we had such a great waiter. I want to give a shoutout to Robert for being the best waiter we all had ever met. He was so polite and engaging without being over the top and he went out of his way to make our celebration memorable. He was happy to give suggestions but was very polite and not pushy in the process. He also learned all of our names and was very attentive. At one point I accidentally dropped my napkin when I got up to use the restroom. I hadn't even noticed I'd dropped it but he had. He brought a new one just in case I wanted it. Also he removed the labels off of the wine bottles we had enjoyed throughout our evening and put them in a card so we could take them home as a keepsake to remember the evening. Overall if your budget will allow it this is where you want to go. It truly is a dining experience." u"One of the best known steakhouses in NYC Del Frisco's is a large place that always seems full of people after work enjoying drinks and steak. The meat was good as was the service. Standard steakhouse fare is available. The bacon was a nice starter." u'First things first the food here is AMAZING. The Wagyu Tomahawk Chop is a must have! The meat was so tender and juice defiantly a good cut of steak. Supposably this steak portion is meant for one person but I think this 32 ounces cut of steak is big enough to share. Especially if you order sides! I recommend the Lobster Macaroni & Cheese and the Cauliflower & Brie Au Gratin. I don\'t think I\'ve ever had cauliflower that tasted that good. Also if you like pineapples I definitely recommend their signature VIP cocktail. It\'s made from vodka infused fresh pineapples! However the services from the wait staff defiantly has room for improvement. (Hence the missing star) I sat close to the walkway and every time a waiter or waitress walked by me my chair got bumped. For the amount I paid for dinner I want to be comfortable and enjoy my experience. Not being constantly bumped every time someone walked behind me and not once did someone say sorry or excuse me. It got to the point I had to ask for our table to be moved. After that I felt like my party wasn\'t given the same attention as those around us. It\'s a shame because A.) Considering the size of the restaurant you expect more space for people to walk around and B.) for a "high end" restaurant I didn\'t expect to be treated so rudely.' u"Finally a place in Nyc that lives up to its hype! Awesome food awesome service and laid back feel! Our steak order was messed up and the chef came out to our table to personally apologize. \xa0Our waiter also comp'd our desserts. \xa0I can't wait to go back!" u"Very nice restaurant in a perfect location. This place is really big and the atmosphere is great. Service is outstanding with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff. I was a little disappointed though. For appetizers we had the bacon and it was caramelized with tiny slices of jalape\xf1o pepper. It was ok but the added spices took away that raw taste of the tick bacon --- didn't like it. The steak is prime meat no doubt. I ate their number 1 cut; the File mignon on the bone. A gorgeous piece of meat indeed but for my personal taste it needed more seasoning and that savory taste --- no juices at all. The side orders; cream spinach and gratin potatoes were one of the best sidings I ever had!!!" u"Overall 90/100Ordered Ribeye with bone Ribeye without bone Escargot Lobster Macaroni & CheeseFlavor.Ribeye with bone 90/100Ribeye without bone 85/100Escargot 40/100Mac and Cheese. 80/100Value. 65/100Freshness 100/100The bone-in Ribeye is one of the best steak's I've tasted and I have tasted plenty of steak. Very few steakhouses I've tried have out-competed this locations flavor (Yes that includes the meh Peter Lugers) and the ones that have out-competed it are located in Texas which is basically the heart of good steak. If you're tight with budget and/or not quite the steak enthusiast the boneless Ribeye will not disappoint either. The escargot which I am normally a big fan of tasted a bit too earthy I believe they need to clean the snails a little better and improve upon the recipe. The Lobster Macaroni & Cheese should be your go to side." u"Very rarely do I reminisce about the steak I've had a almost a month ago... Del Frisco's rib eye was hands down one of the best I've ever had \xa0We ordered the crab cake app ribeye and bone-in ribeye with spinach swt potatoes and lobster mac on the side.... \xa0(all were EXTREMELY delicious although looking at the numbers on my scale right now... i might reconsider cutting out the macaroni but who am i kidding.. i probably would order it again when i visit haha)Don't have anything bad to say at all waiter was great and reasonable and we got a delicious slice of lemon cake since it was the bf's bday...i would just want you to be aware.. it's a $50 corkage fee if you do wind up bringing your own bottle so make sure to do some cost-benefit analysis beforehand...." u"Lovely experience. The corn side dish was SO good we ordered it twice! Our waitress was awesome. Great experience all around. Oh and that house specialty Lemon Cake!!!! It's a MUST!"]
88.At nine Restaurant & Bar,[u"Hell's Kitchen is an area that you could literally close your eyes and randomly pick on a Thai restaurant still have a high chance in selecting a pretty decent one. So today we ended up here at @9. We came in around 8-ish (without a reservation) and were quickly seated. Some must-order dishes - lava chicken our waiter just lightened up a fire on top of our chicken and let it burn! Very unique! The chicken meat was marinated well with the sweet and sour sauce. Pork chop was another signature with the meat cooked tender while still maintained a chewy texture. Strongly recommend their cocktails cute name with delicate presentation.Atmosphere was perfect for friends gather-together really enjoyed my first night of long weekend here!" u"Came here for the lunch special and I wish I hadn't. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao with vegetables and tofu and half the dish was literally eggs. Eggs aside the entire dish was just really subpar. Also had a fishy smell to it...which immediately turned me off to it especially since I don't eat fish. Sauce pooled to the bottom. Just a disaster. Lunch special included an appetizer so I chose spring roll. Pretty easy right? It was literally ONE flimsy spring roll cut in half and put on a dish that was brushed with sauce. Like at least me dip the pathetic thing. The only reason I gave this two stars is because the Thai Iced Tea (which is included in the lunch special) was really good. But overall if I had to pick a Thai lunch special in Hell's Kitchen I'd stay away from this one." u"Ordered lunch special - pad thai that comes with appetizer & a drink for $8.59Was a good price...but sadly I was disappointed with the food... I ordered it on seamless and it came pretty fast but I feel like they rushed making the pad thai.I couldn't finish it ...there was too much sauce in it at the bottom....overall didn't taste that good.And I chose spring rolls for the appetizer...when I saw it it was literally drenched in sauce... Usually I would think they would give sauce on the side...I couldn't even eat the spring rollsThe only thing I thought was good was the thai iced tea...." u"We came here for a fast meal before a show. I feel they can pick up the speed of their service. It was a little too slow for us. We were counting on Thai food to be fast fast fast. Which it usually Is but I noticed they are a bit slow at bringing out the food at @9. They are near the Theatre District so they need to pick up their pace if people are going there for a preshow dinner. I hardly ever order the Pad Thai but I don't usually trust Thai places with not a lot of Thai clientele so I figure the very American clientele probably orders a lot of Pad Thai so how bad can it be? They must have practice with making Pad Thai at this location is my logic because Americans love ordering Pad Thai. Well I was surprised how much I liked their Pad Thai with Chicken ($10.99). They also didn't skimp on the chicken. Is it authentic Thai-style Pad Thai absolutely not. Besides I can't eat authentic pad thai because of the dried shrimp. I am not even sure if I remember any tofu pieces in it either. I couldn't tell with the bad pink lighting in the restaurant! I saw the comments about how bad their Pad Thai is but I have to disagree. It was tart enough for me. And woah they served it with LIME not LEMON. They get kudos from me if they at least present a lime for the Pad Thai. I would totally come back to @9 the next time I'm in the area again. I would just let them know I have show tickets and they need to hurry hurry! P.S. I saw a sign for $6 martinis looks like all day too. My liver doesn't believe in drinking but sounds like a good deal." u'My second time around wasnt as amazing but ill still come back for a third time.for about 9.50 for the veggie/tofu option for lunch special along with an app is a steal in midtown. Altho there are only 4 choices for apps--i still was stuffed this 2nd time i was here.my salad was a smaller portion and the peanut dressing wasnt as warm. i guess the last time i got it fresh.i took a gamble getting the spicy pad udon dish. there was barely any tofu plenty of veggies and flavor. however i feel there was too much sauce to tofu and udon noodles. they were drowning in sauce!the spice deff built up but i wasnt crying.and i just realized i 4got my thai ice tea with it--and the waiter didnt bring it up either! dammit!next time...i will try a curry!' u"Visiting Thailand is high on my bucket list and Thai dining is a small piece of the country therfore \xa0my palette is very sophisticated. \xa0At9 features a very small chic midtown venue. \xa0Tufted leather seating bright shiny posh chandeliers and unique lighting design as expected for a Thai dining experience. \xa0I was seeing a play at Playwrights Horizons on 42nd and stopped in for some pre-show eats. We were seated immediately before the monsoon of happy hour houligans arrived. This is 42nd Street so it is expected alot of tourists and after work crowds frequent here. It's very tiny seating and it can get pretty rowdy! I decided to skip the drink menu due to sitting through a 2 hour show and ordered a Thai Iced Tea Shrimp Tom Ka Soup and assorted Curry puffs. My girlfriend had the chicken satay skewer. The Tom Ka was very flavorful but lacked a sufficient amount of ingredients. \xa0There was hardly any mushrooms or any other vegetable. The scallion lime and rich flavorful coconut milk was extremely aromatic and delicious. \xa0The jumbo shrimp were delicious as well at $4.99. My curry puffs were very soggy and the filling was COLD. I was taken back by this. The food was delivered to us rather quickly however I wonder if they finished baking the appetizer. For $6.99 it was...i guess what I paid for. The puffs were cheese filled....and some with chicken. I would not recommend this appetizer. The couple sitting next to me ordered a dish that smelled like a steaming pile of Kibbles & Bits. Very awful. I've been to several Thai restaurants and while At9 is not terrible they have some work to do. \xa0VIV & Room Service being my favorites in the area. All in all I would come back for the Happy Hour Cocktails and to sample a dinner dish." u"I was at work late in a Thursday and the week was super long and draining. So of course I could use a drink and it's already late so might as well throw some dinner in there too. Looked for a restaurant with good food and most importantly good drink specials. Found this place on Yelp texted my bf to meet me there. So the draw $6 martinis and margaritas all the time! I was pretty much sold at the moment. But hoped they drinks were actually good. In my opinion Thai restaurants and notorious for serving weak drinks. Like you shouldn't even waste your hard earned dollars. But for 6 bucks I'll give a try. I ordered an apple martini haven't had one in so long but it really hit the spot. It was a little sour but good. Not weak and lame like I expected. I approve on the drinks. For food I ordered the Thai basil fried rice is was pretty good. I cleaned my plate. Not out of this world amazing but good as expected. I left happy and satisfied. I'll be back for another round." u'Is a pad thai still a pad thai with no bean sprouts? I am all too familiar with their dishes because work likes to order from this place and unfortunately I have nothing good to say about it. :(' u"$6 Drink Specials All Day! At Nine on 9th Ave is a great choice for small gatherings. Emphasis on small since this place is the size of a Midtown studio apartment but it's enough to get the job done. I love the chandelier and decor which suits a chill night out. \xa0I recently visited this loungey restaurant after work with two of my friends for drinks dinner and catching up. \xa0I recommend coming early or a little before 6pm after work to avoid waiting around for a table. \xa0The service was adequate and we never had to wait long for anything. \xa0Lychee Martinis were just right and everyone enjoyed their meals. \xa0I cannot comment on the authenticity of the Thai cuisine but I can say that it was very tasty. I enjoyed my Chicken Thai Rice and sure the other menu items are just as good.The prices here are extremely reasonable for it's Midtown location and you can actually engage in conversations with your friends. Unfortunately you may have to wait for a table due to limited seating and they do not sit guests unless everyone is present. Overall a great spot and highly recommend it especially for a Girls Night." u"We did not make a reservation however we were able to get seats for 6 people within 20 minutes on a Saturday night.PROS:- nice decor- shrimp massaman avocado ($15.99) - this was really good. Great Portions. Avocado was alright. Avocado was not worth the extra $3 as it wasn't super fresh. You can just get regular Massaman curry with shrimp for($12.99). Not spicy at all. If anything it was super mild.CONS:- place is a smaller than I imagined." u'Food was so good .. Taste is good too ... I always like to try Thai food even tho I am not Thai ... Yummy ;) love spicy ...' u"Decided to give this place a try after walking passed it multiple times. Honestly their $6 drink special posted outside caught my attention. Came in only seeking a drink and small bites after all I was actually headed else where. No reservations no problem. My cousin and I were able to snag a table although afterward this place did fill up pretty quick. We shared their chicken larb which was extremely salty. I do love salty foods but this dish was unbearable. We also ordered their shrimp dumplings which was dry and just okay. Drinks were okay a little on the sweeter side (pomegranate/lychee martini). I really do love the ambiance. The chandler hanging from the ceiling is utterly beautiful. The colors blue & black suites well with the restaurant. Perfect for a date catch up with a friend or just a place to have dinner/drinks.I wanted to rate this place higher but I wasn't impressed with the food at all.." u"First my purpose was happy hours and I haven't tried Thai food before. But the nine is great!! The taste was really nice! Margarita is always good price. Only my issue is their staff didn't see costumers. When I wanted plates checks and to order they didn't come. Even though I always have to wait for them I can give them 5 stars!!" u"Nothing like a booze late lunch. NINE hits the spot! \xa0This trendy Thai dig is conveniently located \xa0away from the tourists \xa0of 42st. I ordered the lunch \xa0special. It came with fried chicken dumplings \xa0and \xa0pineapple \xa0beef fried rice. The whole meal was under 11 bucks. The apple martini \xa0really had me going! Let's just say I had a nice tipsy \xa0day back at the office!" u"This is a 5 for service and a 4 for food. Everything my friend and I got was very sweet so I wasn't sure about that haha however they did an excellent job on their tom yum soup. One of the best I've had!The whole staff is men - but they're friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend coming here and expect a wait in the evenings because this place is small." u'Great Thai restaurant in the Theater District. This place is very small but certainly worth a little bit of wait if you are craving Thai. The spicy pad udon was not even that spicy but just the perfect blend of peanut sauce and spices. I also enjoyed the chicken dumplings as well. Service was great and really enjoyed the cool blue atmosphere of this place.' u"Nice little neighborhood joint with reliably good Thai food and a great little cocktail list. Not particularly touristy despite the location and the staff is friendly. The decor is a little in-your-face and clubby - I wish they'd tone it down a bit. But otherwise it's a great place." u"I stopped for a few hours in NY before catching my next bus and I was craving Thai food. I wanted to try somewhere new. I ordered the Tom yum and the papaya salad because I order that at every Thai place I go. I've had many a Tom yum and papaya salad in my day...and the soup was delicious. A little spicy perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The papaya salad however was very bland. Not spicy at all and I could hardly taste the fish sauce. I was disappointed with the salad and it was $8. Overall the food that other people ordered smelled amazing. Perhaps if I had tried the curry or a stir-fry dish I would find myself giving more credit to the restaurant. The service wasn't anything amazing but they were very friendly and kind and refilled our water without us knowing. My friend didn't order anything and they didn't get mad either. The bathrooms are funky as well but the mirrors were a little distorted so it was hard to see how truly big my food baby was. If I came back I would definitely order something else but I would order the Tom yum again. Pretty good Thai food if you are in the mood." u"Stumbled across this gem via Grubhub. Ever since then it's been my favorite thai restaurant to go to. Their lunch specials are amazing and a great bargain. Their shrimp pad thai is one of the best I've had in years! The staff is super courteous and attentive. Nice decor and great drinks for a regular night out also." u"I came here for a group lunch with a couple of my coworkers. They have a legit lunch menu - 1 app 1 entree and 1 beverage from around $9. The service was a bit slow and we had to wait 20 minutes for one person's dish. The food was on par with most Thai places. They also don't add an automatic service fee when we dined as a group of 8. They also have happy hour specials (it seems like all day when I went) -- $6 for margs and tinis."]
96.Thalia,[u"Okay we had arrived in New York City and we were on a mission. \xa0Cram as much shopping and as many restaurants as you possibly can in four days. \xa0We dropped off our luggage at 6:30AM ate a buffet breakfast at our hotel and then we hit the streets like shopping addicts. \xa0After all of that power shopping we were exhausted and hungry. \xa0We really didn't want to stray too far from our hotel or eat at our hotel again in one day. \xa0Concierge to the rescue! \xa0Restaurant Thalia was one of her suggestions and barely a block away. \xa0We looked at the menu online and decided to make a move.Lovely interior and lovely service from the beginning to the end. Because we arrived relatively early in the evening before the theatre crowd we were able to make reservations easily. \xa0Once seated our wonderful waiter took our drink orders and brought us a house-made bread basket and olive spread. \xa0I'm a sucker for bread and so is my family. (I think that my daughter and tried to OD on bread and olive spread. \xa0My sister showed some restraint because she was ordering a burger served on bread.) \xa0That bread and spread rocked!Because we were hungry we did not play around with the menu. \xa0Here's what we ordered:Me - Prix Fixe menu - Lobster Bisque with sweet corn Roasted Half Free Range Chicken house-made lemon sorbet with crispy merengue and biscottiMuff - Linguine Bolognese with braised beef cheek ragu baby arugula tomatoes and celena cheeseLuch - Thalia Burger - grass fed beef gruyere cheese bacon lettuce tomato onion sesame brioche bun herb friesThe lobster bisque didn't have a lot large chunks of lobster but what it lacked in lobster pieces it made up for in flavor and restaurants can and should be judged by their roasted chicken \xa0Thalia's was superb with crispy skin and moist insides. \xa0Yummy! \xa0And I am not a dessert girl but the lemon sorbet with crispy merengue and biscotti were outstanding. \xa0I tasted my daughter's Linguine Bolognese with braised beef cheek ragu and she almost didn't get her plate back. \xa0My sister also thoroughly enjoyed her burger and fries.From the d\xe9cor to the service to the food we were well pleased with our visit to Thalia!" u'I honestly visited this restaurant because I saw that one of their waitresses was really pretty when I was walking by. But I was hungry too.I started with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and enjoyed their complementary bread with an olive paste. Then I ordered the cioppino seafood stew. It was pretty tasty but the portion was a little small. I looked over the dessert menu but I did not pick anything since most of their deserts were too simple. Classic cheese cake chocolate cake Sunday etc. The atmosphere of the place is really nice and the service was on point [not trying to be biased with the pretty waitress ;) ] I would give it another try if I visit NY again.' u"Usually a nice restaurant and good pre-theater experience disappointed today with non-working AC in the middle of summer heat. \xa0Restaurant was full to capacity and obviously it was very uncomfortable.Food is ok but service is strange- 2 out of 3 people got their food? \xa0Prices are pretty expensive for his type of experience. \xa0I was here twice before and experience was different. \xa0Won't be back..." u'In town from Arlington Texas for a family event. We enjoyed the Restaurant Week here after seeing Avenue Q. The food and service were \xa0amazing! I had blue points and a lovely white. Salmon roll mushroom fricase over polenta for appetizers. Red snapper over cucumber risotto pasta with pesto and buffalo mozzarella. \xa0Dessert was a light raspberry Panna cotta.' u"This is a nice lounge and date night place in the Theatre District. My SO and I came here on a Friday night in March because we saw the dollar oysters after 7 on Yelp. Unfortunately the new policy is $1.50 oysters and half off wine beer mixed drinks from 8pm-close (1am on Fridays).We ordered 12 chef's choice oysters which was the blue point oyster that day. Oysters are all served with mignonette spicy mayo (which I've never heard of but it was tasty!) and tartar sauce. For drinks we had a rose ($11) merlot ($10) and Mother's Milk ($7). I really enjoyed all the drinks we had especially the Mother's Milk which is apparently a pretty rare find!The place was about 3/4 full and it was an intimate atmosphere perfect for a Friday night date. :)" u"Convenience trendy fun fabulous service delicious kale salad fantastic comforting risotto great views perfect for people-watching this is the place you want to go you think of New York this is what you think of. My cookie love it. For dinner we had the homemade Squid Ink capellini made on the premise this pasta is delicious and melts in your mouth haven't had as good since I've been in prison. I'm giving you 5 stars fir atmospheres service location ability and it was scuptumpus !" u"Absolutely in love with this place!!! The atmosphere is amazing with its modern yet classy vibe. Awesome place for a sit down dinner a cocktail in the lounge area or just drinks at the bar.The music is good and don't get me started on the food... SPECTACULAR! If you love oysters... this is your spot!!! Awesome deals on those!The wine menu is perfection also!!!" u'This was our yearly vacation trip to NYC now about 10+ years strong. We use this time to try new places and just enjoy the city for a few days. \xa0We chose Thalia due to it being near our hotel Marriott on Broadway. \xa0Initial thoughts: lovely restaurant with somewhat unusually peppy music like popular artists instead of a neutral background jazz or similar. It had no theme or didn\'t seem to. Right away that lessens the ambience for me.We sat at a table that was nestled near part of a booth so we really liked that location. \xa0When we sat and reviewed the menu the waiter was quick to greet us and ask what we wanted to order. He was somewhat rushed or seemed to not be really interested in any sort of warm welcome. \xa0He recited the special items they had and we ordered a variety of things to try. To start we ordered a salad and the Wild Mushroom risotto and then we also ordered tuna tartare and another salad. \xa0When we ordered the waiter actually said "okay that\'s enough" and that seemed comical to me. He seemed pleased with himself in general and not aware of the need to notice his tables. \xa0He would actually walk around and look anywhere but at our table and this restaurant was 90% empty. \xa0There were about 2 other tables of people near us and he served them also.The salad was amazing and the tuna was good. The risotto was really poor. It was not at all properly cooked and had not reached al dente or any similar stage. It was crunchy/hard and therefore gross. The flavoring was good but the texture was just not right. \xa0Because our waiter had been missing it took a while to get more wine and at one point I told my spouse that we could just leave since clearly we weren\'t going to get wine. \xa0We didn\'t leave immediately but somewhat after.This is a bummer for us because the waiter was not only annoyingly self-aware but not aware of his role as a server. He was in avoidance-mode and probably was tired or just not interested in doing his job. Other staffers were looking on but did nothing to help. \xa0It was strange as if they were all there for a boring party of standing around and not doing anything to actually create a restaurant vibe. \xa0We won\'t be going back.' u'This place was fairly empty on a Saturday night which should have been a warning sign. But I proceeded to choose a nice table amongst the ten or so that were free.My Eastern European waitress was pretty blunt in her welcome. Fair enough who likes working Saturday night? I told her I couldn\'t eat dairy and I asked if there was anything on the menu that I could have (literally everything seemed to either be cooked in butter or made with cheese). She didn\'t seem too happy to engage in helping me out which was a bit annoying (and it\'s annoying enough anyway to not be able to eat anything with dairy in).Then she brought out some foccacia and butter before saying "oh wait you can\'t have that sorry" and taking it away. I felt like one of those children in the supermarket when the parent takes the chocolate out of the basket.In the end I ordered the crab cake (which for the $16 price tag was literally three spoons of crab lumps on some chopped mango) and the squid ink pasta which was better but again the ratio of pasta (loads) to seafood (not enough) was disappointing.This is one of those places that looks expensive in the photo but is cheap and tacky when you touch it. The service wasn\'t great. The food wasn\'t great. It was overpriced. Not a nightmare experience but one to make me not return.' u"Ordered the squid ink capellini and lobster mac 'n cheese. Maybe it was because I was really hungry but I really enjoyed the capellini. I inhaled it. The pasta was a lot spicier than I thought and you can't taste the squid flavour in the pasta that much but the amount of seafood totally made up for it.I only had a bite of the mac 'n cheese so can't really comment on that.Also I liked the crushed olives with olive oil sauce/paste that comes with the bread. It's a fun twist. Service was unfortunately slow and poor." u'Eating breakfast here early on in our trip was a mistake. \xa0We peaked in terms of delicious breakfast. \xa0Nothing could compare. The Eggs Benedict with salmon and spinach was melt in your mouth divine. The interior design was subtle yet kool without trying. Bloody Mary anyone? The best I have had since Banff Canada. Spicy a bit of lemon an olive and not stuffed with junk like celery. \xa0The Buttermilk pancakes with lemon cream and roasted pecans were devoured by our children with out any coaxing. \xa0 Service was non intrusive and \xa0right on.' u"The waiter was very professional and and good at his job.I'm afraid the food was as expected edible.It was a convenient place to meet the company I was with but not really for me." u'The staff is rude. At least the hostess is. I order online for pick up and it was just not good. Not a fan.' u"This review is only for their $1 Oyster Night Deal.$1 Oyster Every Night 7 Days A Week from 7pm till Closing!! There is no deal like that anywhere in the city. My most recent discovery (for maybe a year now) is oysters. We came here after a show and ordered 2 dozen raw oysters. They were pretty standard size very silky and not bad at all. Although no sand in the oyster there were some shell pieces here and there. Nonetheless I'm definitely coming back if I'm in the area." u'Closest place with good reviews and the right price for a late night oyster run$1.50 for blue point only They were super fresh and service was super efficient5 stars for anyone who is craving 1/2 price oysters at 10 pm on a Saturday night' u"I have to say that I was very disappointed with my experience. I came here with my co-workers after work for the $1.50 oysters happy hour which starts at 8PM. Since we came here a little early we grabbed a table and we were excited to try the happy hour oysters. Unfortunately when the oysters arrived we saw that it wasn't fresh and the oysters tasted grainy and hard. Needless to say we could've gone to another oyster bar but I read an article online about this place and was very eager to give Thalia a try based on the good things the article had mentioned.Never again I would highly recommend spending your money some place else that offers $1 oysters happy hour instead of $1.50." u'Stopped in here for a quick drink at the bar and to use the restroom.Had a pint of Stella ($7) and a Hennessy & Ginger ($14). No complaints other than the tax on the bar tab.Restrooms are single stall unisex.' u'This place was okay I came for a friend\'s birthday dinner. I\'m pretty sure they can accommodate large parties 10+(?)Service was nice - they provided an explanation of their menu where needed - refilled water well and was overall helpful and friendly. Never bring cake here tho and in this case there we two cakes. $40 "open" food charge. That\'s so ridiculous - I would be okay if it was $20 but $40 is crazy. Food - I chose the Lobster Mac and Cheese which was very underwhelming - it tasted standard and not unique. I have had lobster mac and cheeses before and they were at a cheaper price point and tasted the same. The lobster portion here was also sooo small and tiny it felt like a scam paying $28 for the meal.The restaurant was playing some upbeat music which I enjoyed but it was fairly loud. Be sure to ask in advance what\'s the oyster menu if you\'re coming or else you\'ll end up spending time and still ordering oysters at the normal price if the oysters you want to eat aren\'t on the happy hour!' u"$1 oysters from 7 to close (assorted)! Woo hoo! Thalia's is a really relaxing place to grab a drink or get dinner. It provides a great atmosphere to chat with friends and for dates I love the high ceilings and mod decor! The food comes out pretty fast and the servers are attentive. It's mostly casual / a little dressy. The calamari is great and you can't beat the dollar oysters! So worth it!" u"Solid neighborhood staple that offers a good mix - there's something for everybody which makes it great when my friends are in the area and I don't have a good sense of their particular tastes as Thalia offers good range from solid salads to seafood to meats to pasta. It's not a huge menu but almost always a crowd-pleaser. It's also conveniently located near midtown and the theater district but just far enough north to allow you to avoid the midtown foot traffic. It's also a decent brunch spot (yum eggs benedict). It's not exactly revolutionary but the dishes range from solid to very good. I've never had anything bad there.The decor is trendy enough to satisfy my out-of-town friends but I can still show up in casual clothes and not feel too out-of-place. Favorites: $1 oysters (though I've heard rumors this may be changing so perhaps call to confirm?) the huge juicy Thalia burger the tuna. Mmm now I want a burger. And oysters."]
167.Café Zaiya,[u"The frappes. Omg make sure you come here at least an hour before they close so you can experience their frappes. I had the black sesame and the green tea - both were so amazing that I actually can't choose a favorite. Regardless of if you're a black sesame fan or not you'll love this drink. My boyfriend HATES black sesame but even he loved it. The black sesame doesn't taste fake and it's strong but not overwhelming. The consistency of both drinks are spot on too - you know when you order a frap from Starbucks and it's icy once you get towards the bottom of the drink? Yeah you won't experience that with Cafe Zaiya. If only I knew their ways so I can make this myself and save myself a little over $5. I've also tried their spicy crab roe origini and their salmon bento box. Both were okay - there was too much rice and too filling for the origini." u"Very small cafe in the bookstore. Limited choices of items compared to the other location. Seats are limited as well.The pastries were good and the staff was really friendly. All in all it's a good place for a quick bite." u'The food is inexpensive with Japanese pastries you have difficult finding elsewhere. However they can taste better as what we tried so far. Their vegan options are the pickled plum rice balls and kombu tofu rice balls. They were OK (pickled plum incredibly sour) but I tasted better vegan rice balls. The rice balls also had very little filling--most is just rice. My fiancee loved the chocolate cornet--that was probably the only pastry she enjoyed the most. I will probably only go back here to purchase the chocolate cornet for her.The eating area is also very small--very packed during lunch hour. If you need to use the rest room there is one on the main floor.' u"The food is delivered in the morning and sits there all day. The bubble tea: you pay almost $5 for half a cup of ice. The cup is already small to begin with so you get a very minimal amount of actual drink. Disappointed. I hate it when caf\xe9s use this sneaky ice trick. This is the Zaiya caf\xe9 in kinokuniya. I'm sure the main locations must be better." u"It's cheap it's fast and it's in the middle of Midtown which makes it easy. But the food is okay and quite cold which is not what I was expecting. As long as you know what you're getting and you're into Japanese fast food that's not sushi then this place is probably for you. But it's not really for me." u'Awful. I have nothing against refrigerated food really although I do prefer freshly made but the food here is bad. Selection is limited. Seating is nonexistent. And a cup of bad matcha latte is $5+!' u"Relatively cheap foods for a cafe in midtown area. I came in around 5 and was sad to see that there was only 1 riceball left but I'll be back to try the other onigiri with more substantial filling than seaweed :3. I had a latte here as well as a melon bread teriyaki chicken rice bowl and matcha steamed muffin. The latte had a nice amount of foam to it and the melon bread can't quite compare to an Asian bakery's pineapple bread (as well as its price). I really enjoyed the chicken teriyaki bowl as I heated up at work and tasted the nice flavors of the bowl mesh together. There was spicy mayo seaweed and Japanese rice in a bowl that contains more than it looks! For a cafe it should have free wifi but the cute Japanese book store compensated for its lack of free internet." u"The people were super nice and the lychee slush was SUPER GOOD! Lychee = summer. I got it with lychee jelly. Because one simply can never overdose on lychee. I also got a chicken katsu bowl thing which was good! Yay. The space is clean but the seats are a bit old and there aren't a whole lot of tables. Best to take your purchases across the street to Bryant Park." u'Ok. I was here last week when I tried to find a place where hot meals were available. I went all the way from the front to the back of the library and finally settled down with this place because my shoes were killing me. Fortunately I saw it some where that this place is associate with a book store otherwise I would never find it. The cafe locates on the second floor of a japanese bookstore. The whole place is small. They have a refrigerator and couple microwaves. Basically the only way you can get a meal here is to select from the refrigerator pay and microwave them. Not exactly what I had in mind. They have fried pork rice curry beef rice sushi Japanese style bread (red bean mellon and so on). They can make tea for you from a tea bag. They do have coffee. Thank god they take cash. Chairs are not exactly comfortable.I do like cafe but microwave foods are not acceptable for me.' u"Very small cafe. Bit pricey for my taste. Most of the food items looked expensive. The workers seemed friendly and it's a great place to read some manga comics or just to eat with friends. But it's very hard to find a good place to sit. If you are looking for a place for a quick bite quick read and a quick fix this place is your foodie place" u"Cute little cafe located on the second floor of the Kinokuniya Bookstore. They have all kinds of affordable Japanese meals and I've come my fair share of times to pick up a little bento for lunch!" u"Neat little hideaway on the second floor of the Japanese book shop. Picked up some onigiri and a package of sushi roll grand total was under $15. A gem for people who work in the area and need an escape from the greasy joints all around. A relatively healthy lunch that's tasty. I didn't try the tea--maybe next time." u'The cafe could use a little TLC or small remodel especially being housed in a large chain bookstore. Regardless it was full of delightful treats and Japanese comfort food.Don\'t go here if you are thinking "cafe" in a Nordstrom\'s with glassware and table service. It\'s counter service quick bites with some fancy sweets tossed in. If you\'re someone who\'s missing Japanese quick grab food and don\'t live near a Sunrise Mart you can get your fix here.' u"Every time I go to Kino I want to try this place but the lines are so long. Luckily it wasn't this time. I wanted to get a mochi donut but they were out:( also they have a $10 minimum for credit card users so I browsed around for something else. I eventually got a chicken teriyaki don yakimochi spicy salmon onigiri and a small hot chocolate and the total came to around $15. The yakimochi was pretty good I liked how chewy it was and red bean is always delicious lolThe spicy salmon onigiri could have been better it lacked any spicy. I think spam would have been a better fillingThe chicken teriyaki don was nothing special. Chicken teriyaki with spicy mayo on some rice and seaweed and a few broccoli and greens.The hot chocolate tastes like dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate and watery" u"Hard to find initially since its tucked away in the second floor of the bookstore and seating is limited. However there's a wide range of snack and pastry food. It is refreshing to see sushi and other Japanese foods in the ready-made section." u"I had an onigiri craving so i stopped by and picked up 3 salmon 2 tuna with mayo and 1 spicy cod roe.All were DELICIOUS. Really enjoyed the spicy cod roe! + i also purchased a chocolate cornet (sp?) and the milk bread. YUMMYYYYthe milk bread was like a little baguette with cream. so good. can't wait to go back! preferably with more $ so i'm able to buy books i don't need (but want) and all the super cute stuffed things they have downstairs LOL" u"Don't get this mistaken with the other Caf\xe9 Zaiyas that exist in the city. \xa0This one is situated on the top floor of a bookstore. \xa0If you sit by the windows you will have a decent view of Bryant Park. \xa0The seating area isn't that impressive and it is small. \xa0The food that is offered is alright. \xa0I believe there's a minimum for card so be sure to bring cash. \xa0I probably won't come back here again because I think there are better options around the area. \xa0Don't be surprised if most of their sandwich stock is gone by the time you go I think those sell fast." u"Cafe Zaiya is great for ballers on a budget. I came here for lunch today and bought a spicy tuna onigiri and a small sandwich 'platter' (1/3's of of egg salad tuna salad and ham sandwiches) for a little over $6. This location on the second floor of the Kinokuniya Bookstore isn't as expansive as their location by the NY Library but it's good to come here for the essentials" u"I visited based on recommendations from Yelp and the close proximity to where I was staying. This bakery location was upstairs on the second floor of Kinokuniya Bookstore. I like Japanese breads and pastries though there's not much of it when I live. Here the dorayaki was fine though a little bit dry and bland. There was a good amount of red bean. The breads (white loaf and others) were quite fresh and weren't all that expensive. For the most part all the breads and pastries looked attractive and I wish I could've tried them all.The view of Bryant Park is lovely and if I were in the area I'd come here to do some remote work. Service was polite and patient." u'Yummy bento box. I had the salmon one and it was very tasty and filling! Limited seating but I was able to grab a spot. A nice place to enjoy lunch for the right price.']
83.Takoyaki Bar,[u"My friend and I took one bite looked at each other and almost cried. We ordered the spicy takoyaki but my expectations were low since other reviews commented on receiving lukewarm balls that didn't seem fresh. They made ours on the spot and I think I burned my mouth a little. The spicy sauce is tangy and delightful with a decent kick. It's a really small but clean place right next to Totto Ramen in Hell's Kitchen. Anyway this place is BOMB and I'm going again today for lunch. Best takoyaki I've had in the states so far." u'Prompted by their Chopsticks NY 8/16 promo which none of the 3 slang-slinging staffers knew anything about but honored (plus an 8th ball) making the tasty Takoyaki a great dinner snack for $5.44. The daughter and in front of me seemed so alarmed by the staff cursing at each other almost as much as the very loud explicit hip-hop overhead.Congrats you earned your first star!Earn 9 more stars and get:$5 Off your next purchase!' u"WOMP. WOMP. WOMPP. I was excited a Takoyaki Bar opened up because who DOESN'T LOVE takoyaki? Me? I LOVE IT. Unfortunately this isn't the place you'll want to venture out to. We tried the various flavors including TakoYaki Mayo Negipon Mayo Takoyaki Ball and Spicy Tako Ball. Each ranging from $5 - $6 I expected nothing but galore. Before consumption I noted a few things. The workers were all Japanese. (This is truly very rare.) The place is SO tiny. This is more of a to-go tako yaki shop. And unfortunately the cashier is also making your takoyaki in the same gloves he accepted your cash in. (UH..... sanitary team where'd ya go??)Okay let's get down to business. Flavor was OK it truly didn't blow my mind. The dishI liked the most was the Spicy Tako Ball and my least favorite was the Negipon Ball. The true disappointment is how LUKE WARM they were. It was borderline cold which was surprising because we saw him take it out of a what we thought was a heater but maybe it was just a display case. The shop also blasted extremely loud music. I didn't want to leave extremely disappointed so I gave it one more go and tried their vanilla ice cream with matcha sauce.Oh boy don't go there for the ice cream. DEFINITELY not worth it. A scoop of store bought ice cream with bitter matcha sauce made for a BLECH dessert. Stick with Totto you aren't missing out on anything here." u"Nice attempt of Totto ramen (right next door) to deal with the long line of waiting customers. This newly developed takoyaki bar is created by the totto ramen. They serve exactly what you think; takoyaki. At $5 a pop for a set of 6 balls it's not a bad deal if you don't want to starve to death. The takoyaki was alright. Very small size with small piece of octopus inside. But the flavor was good. I would come here only if I go to totto ramen and have to wait more than 30 mins for a seat. Then I would get the takoyaki so I can buy some more time before I starve to death" u"Having just returned from Japan I wanted to find more Japanese food options in NY so when I read about the takoyaki bar in Midtown I went the very next day. It was Sunday afternoon so there was no line and only a couple seated. I ordered the octopus takoyaki and got a green tea drink. I didn't see them make it which is part of the fun so I assume they had it pre made and just heated them. They were smaller than the ones I had in Japan but still delicious! I brought the ad from Chopsticks magazine which offered an extra free ball but they didn't know about it and didn't honor it :/. Anyhow you get 6 pieces for $5 which is a very sweet deal for a Midtown location." u"I was excited to try this place for some time. My friend and I came for a snack before dinner. We tried the negipon style Takoyaki and the regular style Takoyaki with chicken. Both were really good and very well made. They were both very much representative of Takoyaki as a food and tasted just like what we used to get in Japan. One thing I would caution folks on is that they don't serve alcoholic beverages in case you thought it was that sort of bar and the place is a bit small. The flavors were great and the staff were friendly though. It's also the only place I've been that offers a chicken option and lots of different sauce styles. It's a good place to grab some Takoyaki if you're in the mood and in the area." u"Limited menu (see picture); they basically have different variations of takoyaki and fried chicken bun. I got the standard takoyaki ($5) and the chicken bun ($5). The food is premade and kept heated in a display and finished with sauce and garnish when you order. I came during a weekday around 1pm and it wasn't busy at all likely b/c it's new but I think they would greatly benefit from making it fresh when someone orders. I understand pre making it when you have high turnover and it's busy but not now when business hasn't totally picked up yet. The takoyaki was a tad mushy and deflated but the taste was good. The chicken was a tad thin for me but again taste was pretty good. Pickles and lettuce were standard.. This rating leans towards more of a 3.5 with room for improvement if they made it on the spot. Would definitely come back to eat as a snack as I ordered this as a meal for lunch and it was a tad heavy. Totto ramen is right next door and I'm surprised there aren't more people ordering takoyaki as a quick snack as they wait for the ridiculous ramen line. Side note they also serve ice cream with matcha sauce." u"I went there yesterday got the regular takoyaki the spicy one and the chicken bun. The Takoyaki was way smaller than I had expected but I think it wasn't a bad deal because it wasn't that expensive. (Around $5-$5.5) The buns were pretty big and I was satisfied. Overall it's a great place to get some fast Japanese food!" u"Chicken is spicy (if you don't like spicy I wouldn't recommend) and has amazing flavor! The takoyaki is beyond delicious!!" u"The fried chicken bun was delish! So delish my daughter wanted to go back a second day in a row! Even the friendly staff (I think he's also the cook) who helped us our first visit noticed we came back again. Sometimes I have to wait about 10 min until they cook a fresh batch but worth it. Call in advance if you can for a pick up instead since space is tight with only a few tables. Good prices and portion size for midtown west. This will be another of my neighborhood go-to-spot for here on out!" u"Really good small restaurant serving delicious octopus balls - and in our opinion even better - fried chicken buns. \xa0These are similar to the pork belly buns served at Totto next door (which appears to be a sister restaurant? \xa0Same font and design on sign) the primary difference is that instead of pork belly in the rice bun it's delicious fried chicken. \xa0Served with similar mayo to the Totto recipe as well. \xa0They also add a pickle to the sandwich that is really good. \xa0Service was very good and fast as well." u'Simple menu friendly service. Had the takoyaki & tako-chicken $5 / 6 pieces to an order. Takes about 10 minutes to cook fresh -- worth the wait & then be careful not to burn your tongue. Enjoyed hot sauce on the side & cup of hot sencha. Delicious!' u"It was a delightful choice for snack or brief lunch during my short visit at nyc. Affordable prices. I just wish that the octopus in basic tacoyakis can be just a little bigger:P They belong to the same owner of the ramen shop next door. I haven't tried it yet but attempt to do so tomorrow." u'Bona fide takoyaki - hot gooey octopus dough balls. Quintessential Japanese street fair and festival food now easily orderable at a local joint! Insanely inexpensive and made-to-order it was an apt appetizer while waiting next door at venerable Totto Ramen. My friend and I fought for the last takoyaki mouthful - sadly he won.' u"Great hole in the wall spot right next door to Totto Ramen. (This place seems to be under the same ownership and management but completely separate space.) Food and service was perfect. I got the Japenese curry + fried chicken with extra fried chicken. Super tender fried chicken flavorful -- and just the right amount of spicy -- curry with perfectly sticky rice. Much brighter spot than next door but a great intimate setting as well. Awesome staff. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the meny." u'The fried chicken bun is amazing. Generous serving of crispy tender well-seasoned chicken coupled with Japanese mayo and takoyaki sauce. Their takoyaki is also worth checking out but I go there solely for the bun... That savory delicious bun.' u'We ordered chicken and spicy Takoyaki. Nice and hot freshly made. Both extremely tasty and presented well. Added bonus the playlist playing was pretty awesome.' u"Simplicity at it's best! Fried chicken on steam bun sublime! This restaurant proves basic and simple approach can be successful! This is not fast food - high quality at a great price! Can't go wrong with the octopus as well." u'Went after work saw this place next to totto ramen with similar awning. Ordered original and chicken takoyaki. Gotta let it sit 5 min after serve. Was hungry so I rushed into it slightly burning my tongue(I was warned). Enjoyed the last 5 pieces really tasty and creamy texture with modest amounts of chicken/octopus with the right temperature.']
98.Victor’s Cafe,[u"This food. This environment. The service! I have walked by Victor's Cafe since 2009 when I was on Broadway just a few doors down. Why didn't I go in?!?! Walked in for dinner the other day finally. the decor was very classy upon entrance. The table was in the back room where there's a sky roof full of natural light and lots of Cuban/Miami pastels--very nice touch! We ordered 3 small plates and an avocado with bacon/guacamole goodness inside. It was worth all of our time! Every dish was FULL of flavor. The service was super attentive and polite. There was also FABULOUS live music happening in the bar area and yes I salsa'd my way out the front door. Prices point matches that of midtown QUALITY food and ambiance. GO!" u"Victor's Cafe is living on it's name alone! Decided to have dinner here on a whim after watching Jersey Boys. We were hungry and when I noticed that this well known spot was just across the street we had to check it out! The restaurant is beautiful --- very tastefully decorated modern but with a feel reminiscent of old Havana. We were seated in the back room with lots of plants and fans on the ceiling and promptly presented with menus. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and quickly decided on an appetizer and the entrees we wanted.I understand that portions can be small at certain restaurants but our Cuban Quesadilla was ridiculous. It was the equivalent of 4 bites shared between two people. It was delicious! But again ridiculous given the price tag. My husband ordered the Camarones Enchilados and it was fantastic! However when he ordered the waiter asked him what accompaniment he wanted with his meal and offered tostones roasted vegetables or an avocado salad of which he chose the latter. When our bill arrived we noticed that the salad was not included with the meal at all and was in fact $14 for a plate of watercress and a quarter of an avocado! We didn't fight it it would have been in poor taste and I suppose we should have inquired whether or not it was included when ordering but it was very misleading. I ordered the short ribs which were the most substantial portion but also the weakest dish of everything we tried. It was seasoned with some sort of very odd herb that gave it a weird and unpleasant aftertaste.Service was somewhat scattered and can be called average at best. Victor's Cafe seems to lack the authenticity that I had always heard it was so famous for. Cauliflower puree? Organic field greens? Champagne vinaigrette? Give me a break! The restaurant is beautiful. And that's about all. Rincon Criollo in Corona Queens may not look as posh but their food and service beats Victor's Cafe by a mile! Stop by for a drink and enjoy the ambiance then head elsewhere for dinner." u"YUM! The snapper ceviche was to die for the empanadas were amazing and the Ponle ropa a la vaca was a flavor bomb. \xa0I could eat the churros forever. The service was amazing everyone was polite and nice and we're happy to give us suggestions! A little pricy but totally worth it!" u"My husband and I had only had one prior Cuban meal in the city. But if all Cuban foods were as good as ones served at victor's cafe then we need to eat it more frequently! We invited 4 of our friends to a triple dinner date on Friday night. First thing that struck us - We really loved the ambiance of the restaurant - the decor the music - everything just seemed so perfect. The service was a bit on the slower side which surprised me since Victor's Cafe is such a popular dining go-to for nearby theatres. Although our foods did take some time to be served we were given complimentary plantain chips to hold us over. They were still warm when served - I couldn't help but demolish (almost) the entire basket myself. My husband and I stuck to their signature entrees - ropa vieja and camaneros enchilados - while our friends also ordered the ceviche and empanadas to start. The portions might appear small at first glance (my eyes are always bigger than my stomach) but they were surprisingly filling. My husband couldn't stop raving about his dish. And I found my shrimp in creole sauce over mashed sweet potato? with rice and beans extremely tasty! The shrimp were a bit overcooked but the sauce was lick my bowl worthy. The rice were fluffy and the beans were perfectly seasoned - we didn't bother ordering any additional sides since these two basic pairings were already so satisfying! I purposely didn't get a starter because I wanted to save enough stomach room for desserts! Each couple shared a tres leches came and guava cobbler The majority of the group preferred the tres leches. I thought it was good but I had better (hello Calle Dao!) - it was a little too dense and not sweet enough for me. I enjoyed the warm gooey crumbly guava cobbler served with vanilla ice cream much more. Overall - service was attentive foods were tasty ambiance was perfect - Definitely check out Victor's Cafe especially when in theater district!" u'Several of my friends and I have been coming here for many many years. We always brought other people visitors/guests from out of town etc. because the food and service were always on point. As reflected in my previous reviews. So we brought back a group of 10 here after a show about a month or so ago. Unfortunately.......the experience was quite disappointing. The place was busy on a Saturday night which is pretty typical for most well know/good places in NYC. But the standard of food & service was simply not the same as we have experienced in the past years. Took the waiter forever to get our drinks out. We asked for more of the plantain chips and were told that the kitchen was out of them & preparing more....a Cuban spot running out of plantain chips on a Sat night really? (Poor planning). But then we see them being brought to other tables around us & our waiter completely forgot to get us more. When you are pay $100/head or more....an extra round of chips should not be too much to ask. Many of the entrees that came out were barely lukewarm at best.....2 people had the fish entree special & it was way too salty. The classic Ropa Vieja had been changed & was no longer served in the classic plantain chips basket. Dessert was just OK.Overall not the best night.... :(' u"I have a soft spot for Victor's cafe because we go out for a family dinner here every year and it is always a good time.I like the well seasoned cuban food.It is a little expensive but I wouldn't say the food isn't worth the money and the interior of the restaurant is pretty cool." u'This is one of my favorite Midtown restaurants. \xa0I have been there many times over the past two decades and I have never had a bad experience. \xa0The food and service are always great. \xa0Friendly helpful servers and diligent room management make a busy spot run smoothly.I have had many items from the menus but always remember the Salpic\xf3n de Mariscos appetizer and Ropa Vieja entree.If I could eat here weekly I would!' u"So far not so good. 5:45 pre-theatre reservation. Either they don't want to seat me prior to entire party arriving or the table not ready till 6:00. Either way it's not a good start. But this is Times Square and they do have to deal with tourists. Hoping the food is worth it because the front desk staff isn't" u"Well hadn't been here for several years and although the place remains impeccably perfect in decor and ambiance and culture is on FLEEK the artwork on display is still very true to Cuban art. \xa0Everything from the live music in the Cuba Lounge (bar) when you walk in to the lighting  staff plants and the soul of this place is authentic. \xa0We had the sampler appetizer with the croquetas (real ham croquetas) corn based Tamal empanadas and seafood fritters were amazing. \xa0We also had the vaca frita (crispy fried beef strips) which come scooped perfectly in a green plantain flower bud. \xa0And we also ordered the Ponle Ropa A La Vaca which had vaca frita and a ropa vieja which is a similar meat (not crispy)but stewed and in a tomatoe based sauce." u'I came here for a late dinner with a colleague/friend on a Saturday night. It\'s pretty much just blocks away from the touristy Times Square area so you will get that vibe when you\'re just outside the restaurant. Once you get inside though it\'s a whole other story. The ambiance completely changes into a classy but casual atmosphere. I love the decor of the restaurant and the way the tables are arranged (there\'s plenty of seating but it\'s not tight). Also there is an area in the back that sort of looks like a lounge. In this area there is a VIP looking table with a semi-circular booth. It made me want to dress up in a fancy dress and fur sit at that table and order expensive champagne-like a boss. *insert daydreamingBack to reality: my friend and I decided on the "1492 Aperitivo Cubano" which is an appetizer for two with a variety of foods; basically a sample platter. I was looking forward to trying different things. Honestly it was just okay. It tasted fresh though. My drink (the mojito with the sugar cane stick) was delightful and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Our waiter was nice but seemed slightly forgetful. For example after I ordered my drink I saw him standing idle near the kitchen. Still when we were waiting for a while he did look in our direction and get what we had requested without having to be asked a second time.Overall positive experience. Want to go back for entrees next time.SN: take that silly hand drying contraption out of the bathroom-yes the one where you have to stick your hands in and let them dry. The grey and yellow one that looks all futuristic. The one where you have to stand complete still when drying your hands so you won\'t accidentally hit your hand against the dryer and have to wash and dry them again. That is all thanks.' u'Food taste very fresh portions were just right.I had the shrimp it was delicious my bf had pork he said it was very flavorful a tad greasy but okay.Mine came with rice and black beans i add sweet plantains.' u"Came here for dinner with a large party and was quite pleased with everything: the food the service and the overall ambiance.My mind is blanking on the full array of starters and shared plates but I'll try giving a run down of the things I know we had!Ceviche de Pargo ($16): 5/5- This. Was. AMAZING! I loved every moment of this ceviche and honestly wish I'd ordered my own instead of sharing with the table. It was that good.Aguacate Relleno ($12)- I didn't try this myself as I don't eat bacon but this was a huge hit amongst the rest of my party and I won't lie -- I was a little envious because it looked delicious.Other shared plates I can't seem to find on the menu included fried plaintains and a crab appetizer both of which were also delicious. Now onto the main courses!Camarones Enchilados ($27): 4/5- I really enjoyed this dish. The shrimp was done perfectly and I loved the sauce! I wish there was a little more kick to it though.Paella de Langosta y Mariscos ($44): 5/5- This seems like an expensive dish (and it is) but honestly it is HUGE! Two people could easily share this. Lucky for me I sat next to someone who ordered it and got to try quite a bit! Amazing.We also had plenty of sangria which was also delicious. Bathrooms are located downstairs. Overall a solid Cuban restaurant in Midtown." u"If I could give this place zero stars I would readily do so. \xa0After reading the numerous reviews on how amazing this restaurant is I went ahead and made reservations a month before my trip to New York. \xa0Upon arriving at the restaurant they seated us in the bar lounge not in the main restaurant dining room in what was literally a hallway. \xa0When I asked if there were any other tables they said I would have to wait 45 more minutes for a table in the actual dining room. \xa0Considering that this is a higher end restaurant I was appalled that after making these reservations a month ago this was the best seat they could give us. \xa0We left the restaurant frustrated and unhappy with the service that we received from the two hosts. \xa0I'm sure the food is amazing but the service is much to be desired." u"Not many places are able to blow my mind. \xa0Victors Cafe did exactly that. Especially when your someone like myself who's eaten at a lot of restaurants or even if you frequent the same ones over and over again. \xa0Now even though I've meet the owners through a old friend who use to work here my review isn't biased.Pros:From the time that I walked in until the time that I walked out customer service was A+Food is A+ I enjoyed the ox tail empanadas red snapper and ceviche de camarones so much I wish their was more when I was finished. It left a lasting imprint. Live music played by different musicians which makes VC's feel so much more Cuban! Like let's face it its hard to create an authentic Cuban environment in the middle of the concrete jungle. That doesn't stop VC's from providing you with that authenticity that screens out; tasty Cuban food Cuban music that'll have you begging to return.p.s last time I visited was summer 2015 and plan on returning this summer~" u"Great atmosphere. Great food. Great service. If you're in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the money." u'The and I mean the only place for a mojito I like mine with passion fruit. Highly recommend the Lechon Asado or Ropa Vieja cuban staples. Be sure to go on a Friday or Saturday night for the live performances (at the Cuba Lounge). My group was serenaded and became the subject matter of the impromptu songs it was an absolute trip!!' u'An amazing experience so great we went two nights in a row! \xa0The first night we were in a rush due to a show. \xa0The waiter was extremely accommodating and made food recommendations that would come out quicker. \xa0Combine the wonderful service with nice ambiance music playing and some great food what more could you ask for! \xa0Since we enjoyed the food so much we decided to come back the next night and give us more time to enjoy the food. \xa0Again great service and food. \xa0This is a must go \xa0if you have a show to attend. \xa0Try to go a little early so you can enjoy multiple dishes and just a great experience!' u"This is by far my favorite Cuban restaurant in NY. Excellent service and amazing food. Don't miss the tostones." u"First time here. Place was packed. We made a reservation and asked to be seated near the bar area so we could see the live band perform. The service was amazing and the food even better. I highly recommend this restaurant. Definitely a great find. The Cuban sandwich I ordered was delish so we're the appetizers we ordered Papas Rellanas and Piquillo Rellano. Your welcome. Happy eating!!" u'I order 1495  pitiful really they changed it left the same price but reduced the plate shame on you mojitos where great']
176.Cha Pa’s Noodles and Grill,[u"Delicious as well as affordable...the Pho is flavorful the Lemongrass dishes are out of this world and lunch specials are an incredible value at $7.95. They also offer a happy hour from 4pm to 8pm.Don't agonize over this one it's not that hard...just do it!" u"There aren't many Vietnamese options in the UWS.. Cha Pa had the highest rating nearby so we went with them; Ordered (for delivery) the traditional and the pork banh mi. The delivery only took about 40 minutes. Unfortunately the food was only okay. They have most of the elements to make the sandwich (no p\xe2t\xe9!) but being Vietnamese their standards didn't reach mine. The bread was way too soft for a banh mi. The cilantro which should be piled on like the pickled vegetables was one measly stalk. The protein for both sandwiches was overcooked and lacked flavor. P.S. If you ask for it spicy they just throw on a line of Sriracha. Every other place I've gotten banh mi from uses fresh peppers (like jalape\xf1os or Thai chili peppers). Depends on your preference I prefer sliced chilis on my sandwich." u"Solid pre-theater option for the theaters on the upper end of the theater district (Carnegie Hall NY City Center 54 Below etc).Pretty broad Vietnamese menu that includes pho vermicelli noodle bowls banh mi etc. It may not be the cheapest or most authenticVietnamese food but for midtown near theaters it's fast not too crowded (though there was a wait for tables by the time we started eating) and the food is yummy! I had the chicken vermicelli bowl and tried others' food as well (fresh summer rolls beef pho). \xa0Best part- final bill for my portion was under $15." u'Food came quickly (we had told them we were in a hurry for the theater). It was tasty and service was friendly. Perfect choice just off the tourist strip.' u"A sweet little place. It feels very authentic & the staff is very attentive. The pork spring rolls were just OK but the hanger steak pho was excellent. A perfect warm meal for a chilly January night in NYC. I'll be back on my next trip to the theater district!" u"Ordered for lunch and it arrived in 45 minutes. My take:Lemongrass chicken over rice - While the rice could've been fluffier the chicken was nicely seasoned and super tender. I also loved the pickled carrots and radish on the side. The dish was on the sweet side but I love sweet.Vietnamese fish sauce - Their sweet fish sauce was a little too concentrated for me and therefore quite salty. Some places dilute it a bit more but then again you can always do it yourself by adding a splash of filtered water.Will definitely order for lunch again." u"+/- THE FOODWas desperate for food at 9 PM on a Tuesday night so the boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try. I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli bowl and he got the grilled pork rice plate. Despite the both of us getting grilled pork our meats tasted completely different. Mine was so dry lacking in flavor and cold that it was difficult to eat. His was hot fresh and really flavorful. What's the deal with that?? My noodles tasted decent and came with a bunch of veggies. Portion sizes are pretty big so get what you paid for." u"The dishes tasted great but were expensive for what we ordered. Not too surprising compared to prices in this neighborhood though the atmosphere and the service are better than typical Asian restaurants. The restaurant itself is long and narrow with a small bar on one side tables on the other side and a separated waiting area by the entrance. It is rather clean.We came for dinner and ordered...$10 Special Pho - Pho Dac Biet with round steak well-done flank brisket soft tendon and bible tripe:Good pho with very tender rare beef and soft tendons. I was so glad to eat tendons that weren't as tough as an eraser. I had asked for rare steak on the side. It tasted very fresh not frozen at all. The broth was pretty light in flavor. I'm used to getting a piping hot bowl of soup but the temperature was fine to eat right away so you don't need to wait for it to cool. It's still good for dipping the beef directly into the broth to lightly cook it. You won't have to worry about the meat overcooking or drying out in this soup.The usual condiments - sriracha peanut sauce sambal oelek bean sprouts jalapenos lime wedge basil were presented nicely on a sectioned plate. I don't know what you would use the peanut sauce for. I was a little surprised that it didn't come with hoisin. I'm used to bottles of sauces on the table though so I can add as much or as little sriracha as I want and so I can apply it directly to the meat. Not to be picky because their way works too. I guess this way there is less waste.$13.95 Braised Pork Bacon with Egg in Clay Pot:This dish comes with rice. The braising liquid is very sweet but goes great over the rice. The pork is very reminiscent of Chinese red-cooked pork (like \u7ea2\u70e7\u8089). It was delicious with the tender braised pork skin. It's pretty expensive for what you get though.We also got a Myanmar beer which just tastes like a typical light beer like Heineken or Qingdao. I enjoyed the service here too. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. I was sitting next to their oscillating heater and she was nice enough to ask me if I was okay with the temperature. I even liked all the '90s songs playing in the background even though I overheard some ladies who sat next to us making fun of the music. Though I enjoyed the food the cost will probably deter me from returning unless I am specifically craving Vietnamese food around this neighborhood. Overall I give it a 7.75/10." u"I ended up here for dinner on New Years' day a plan B to our Plan A of Ramen \xa0(either Totto or Ippudo). \xa0Both Plan A options were closed and no surprise since New Year's day is a huge holiday in Japan. \xa0 The TL; DR of this ultimately is go to Obao instead if you're craving better/more authentic Vietnamese. Bf and I ordered spring rolls to start. \xa0Springs rolls were more chewy than crispy. \xa0It tasted average. \xa0BF ordered the clay pot pork belly. \xa0It should have been named cast iron pot pork belly as it came in a handled cast iron pot. \xa0I hate when a menu sets you up for one thing and then gives you another. The pork belly was braised in an overly sweetened soy sauce broth with vegetables and the dish didn't particularly sing to me. \xa0I ordered a Cari ga expecting a punchy savory yellow curry but this was more a cross between a Thai massaman and panang - sweeter more reddish with a peanutty undertone. \xa0It was again not what I had expected. \xa0 I don't care for overly sweet in my savory. \xa0 \xa0All in all it was serviceable but not quite there for me." u"Today Boo and I came here for our Vietnamese fix. There were a few PROs and a couple CONs which I'll break down for ya' below...PROs:+ Good food+ Vegan options+ Lunch special prices are good and portions heartyCONs:- The server was a bit rude and this does reflect on the restaurant itselfWe specifically (but kindly) told the server several times we did not want any fish sauce oyster sauce or any other animal product on anything. He assured us nothing had it and when he brought the side salad he said it has fish sauce so I said we couldn't have it. He ran off unapologetically after a heavy sigh and eye roll without offering to bring us the salad without the dressing. Not our fault bro - we told you we didn't want fish sauce and you acknowledged this. Anyway we got the summer rolls vegan pho (me) and vermicelli veggie bowl (Boo). The summer rolls were good served with hoison sauce. I felt like it could have used basil mint and/or carrots in it as it was just tofu vermicelli and bean sprouts which is \xa0just lacking in flavor contrast. The pho was really good albeit the plate of veggies / sprouts they brought out with it was rather dismal - in most Vietnamese places (not strictly comparing this to the ones I'd frequent in California but local ones as well) I have always been given a large plate of basil sprouts and other veggies. The Boo's vermicelli bowl was great and had lemongrass which we loved.In summation I may return if already in the area and wanting Vietnamese fare but will stick to what I know is good." u'Nice and clean eatery. Portion leans toward the smaller side. Quick service. The grilled pork was tender and well seasoned.' u"My friends and I ended up at Cha Pa's by chance. We were trying to go to another restaurant around 8:30pm on a Friday night but the wait was too long. We were craving Asian food and passed by this place so we thought we would give it a try. I was excited since I was craving Vermicelli noodles! I ordered the Grilled Pork Vermicelli Bowl with Cha Gio Roll and thai iced tea and my friends both got the Spicy beef lemongrass soup (Bun bo hue).Pros:Service was pretty good they were quick and checked up on us a few timesVermicelli Bowl had really good flavorCons:I paid $2 extra for the a very small Cha Gio Roll - don't think that was worth itThere wasn't that much meat in the Vermicelli bowlMy friends must have gotten the bottom of the pot for their spicy beef soup. The lemongrass was too overpowering.The thai iced tea was watered down and didn't have that bold tea flavor.The food here was subpar and I could've gotten better vietnamese food at a better price in Northern VA or Richmond." u"I am regular here. Food is always delicious with relatively quick delivery. I frequently order for pick up as well and that wait time is almost always longer which is annoying...When I do sit in at the restaurant for lunch I am always with my 1 year old and they are always accommodating. However I would suggest if you need the more quiet time or don't want to feel too rushed with people standing over your table waiting for you to get up then dine in early before the real lunch rush (12:00 PM is usually a great time).Food: Grilled pork with rice is my favorite. Pho is my second go to. The summer rolls with shrimp and spring rolls are also favorites!" u"Unfortunately there wasn't much to enjoy at Cha Pa's. The cuisine is contemporary Vietnamese. Don't go if you are expecting purely traditional Saigon cuisine. Although all of the food is familiar different ingredients are substituted or added I'm assuming as a way to update the recipes. Food is reasonably priced but other places offer better quality and value.I ordered an iced coffee as I usually do at any Vietnamese or Thai joint. I was a little let down when my coffee arrived already pre-mixed. I feel that at sit-down restaurants such as this they should serve the coffee setup with the drip coffee over the condensed milk and the cup of ice to the side. It was apparent that authenticity was not going to be a strength here. I ordered the fried spring rolls as an appetizer which were more chewy rather than crispy and served with only 1 piece of lettuce which still had dirt on it from not being washed.For my entree I ordered the rare beef pho and requested to have the beef served on the side. This must have been confusing because the dish arrived with brisket in the soup and 3 pieces of raw beef on the side. I didn't mention anything to the staff because I figured I wasn't clear on what I wanted. The accompaniments were minimal definitely not the plateful of greens and sprouts that normally accompany pho in any other similar establishment. Although I was disappointed with the presentation and quality of ingredients the pho broth was quite tasty. There was depth of flavor which surprised me because everything else fell far short of wonderful.I couldn't recommend this restaurant and probably wouldn't return due to all of the shortcomings." u'I needed a "Post first Show Day" dinner. This was my choice and a happy one it was. If not for the noisyy 20-something\'s two tables down I could nearly call it a 5 star \xa0experience.I was welcomed and quickly tabled. 2 minutes later wine in hand I was perusing the menu and quickly decompressing from my white knuckle work day.Steamed dumplings and eventually my spiced up seafood pho summoned the sign of ecstasy I so much needed.The food was delish the servers pleasant and efficient.The restaraunt is a comfortable place though noisy with all it\'s hard walls and tiled (?) Floors.I give it a big thumbs up and a " Give it a Try" from Poppa Duke' u'There are few constants in my life and one of them is: if it rains I eat pho. if it rains all day I eat pho twice. So if im stuck working in midtown and it rains ill yelp "pho" and go to the first place yelp recommends. I do not pass go - not even for $200. it hurts me to say this but this place has mediocre pho. I cant even believe im writing that since pho is perfection on a bowl - but the meat in the soup (as well as the broth itswlf) was sub par. \xa0If you can go somewhere else. \xa0I went twice and was let down both times. \xa0Being stuck in midtown on a rainy day sucks. sigh. 2.5 But 3 stars here on yelp because the guys that work there are great.' u'We found this place on Yelp and we really enjoyed it! \xa0I had the Pho Ga which is made with beef broth and my husband had Buo Lu Lac. \xa0The broth was extreme flavorful and smooth. \xa0It was not salty but just perfect. \xa0My husband enjoyed his dish mainly because he liked how crispy the beef was. \xa0It seems like they had cornstarch to the beef before own searing it. \xa0He said that makes all the difference and he has not been anywhere that they do that. \xa0We would definitely visit again when in NYC!' u'I came here for dinner with my friend. I enjoyed the diverse music there was some old school kpop. And I love me some Kpop (girl groups only)!!!! I got the Vietnamese beer for myself and we shared the spring roll. We both ordered the hangar steak noodle soup.The soup tasted like something I could get in Chinatown. But it was still a good hearty beef noodle soup. I really suspect that the staff are mainly Chinese and loosely Vietnamese. I would come back here if other options around the area had a long wait. Credit card accepted' u'UPDATE: These guys are awesome and discounted my check without me even asking. Always great service. Upped my review. I just hope they fix the issue below.I\'m "The Duke" of Cha Pa\'s. I come here often because of proximity to work. Unfortunately today I have to update my review and my praise for the place. I ordered the vermicelli bowl per usual. Normally I get the chicken but lately there\'s been a lot of chewy not meaty cuts coming out so today I decided to order the pork. TERRIBLE. It was inedible. Literally all of the pork was just thin cuts of fat. The gross fat that you can\'t even rip apart with your teeth. It\'s turned me off. When I order meat I want meat not fat scraps.I mentioned it to my waitress and asked her to please tell them in the back.' u"Not going to lie but I go through phases where I come here every day for lunch. I'm not too picky so can't comment on how authentic it is... but when you want Vietnamese food this place hits the spot.They have a nice array of lunch specials under $10 (w/o tip). Service is quick and friendly especially since I usually come here for a late lunch. I've had the beef pho the vermicelli noodles and the chicken curry with rice."]
109.Island Burgers & Shakes,[u'Island Burgers & Shakes opened its first location in 1996 and have been serving mouthwatering flame-grilled burgers sandwiches salads and milk shakes for the past 20 years. Here are some of my favorite items!Tuscan Salad with Grilled ChickenThis huge entree-sized salad incorporates fresh vegetables with a protein of choice for a healthy and hearty meal. The Tuscan salad includes generous portions of raw mushrooms onions roasted peppers black olives artichoke hearts tomato slices and fresh mozzarella with grilled chicken rubbed with spices all over a bed of mixed greens.Build-Your-Own Turkey BurgerCustom make your own burger creation. You start with a choice of protein - hamburger grilled chicken breast turkey burger or portobello mushroom - and add additional items like cheese like cheddar Swiss Monterey Jack sauces and toppings like onions guacamole mushrooms and salsa. There are so many combinations to create your perfect burger.Sweet Potato FriesA side of sweet potato fries is a must. The fries are perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and packs tons of flavors. You can also add sauces like Bayou mayo or curried sour cream to enhance the flavors.' u"Pure review with regard to their strawberry milkshake. Okay.Something's off.I'd rather have 5 guys' milkshake or shake shack's milkshake for less dollar." u"I told myself I wouldn't review anything during my 10 day trip back to the east coast. \xa0But there are many things I don't want to forget to say.1) music & ambience - excellent. \xa0I feel like this is my playlist. \xa0The decor is random and semi-60's with the huge marley poster along with Janis & Beatles. \xa0Also a shout out to Hawaii with a Moana (surfrider) hotel clock face.2) service - super friendly attentive & efficient.3) food - great! I'm NOT a burger person but my husband wanted to try a NYC burger so we came. \xa0The food was piping hot and fries were crispy (just the way I like it). \xa0I had the $10 (cash) lunch specials: burger fries drink.My hubby for the Hobie au poivre - blue cheese saut\xe9ed onion bacon w/ peppercorn. \xa0He rated it 3.8/5 he has cooking experience and stated the bread broke apart too easily. \xa0But enjoyed it.If I was a burger eater especially with the music and comfortable temperature - I woulda given it a 5." u"We were in the area looking for a quick lunch bite on the way to the park no wait and the reviews seemed good! Family of 3 we got 2 burgers and 2 fries and it was enough for all of us. My first thought was that the burgers are already on the pricey side and fries are still extra on top of that? But the french fry portion is very generous and super tasty it's definitely a must add on. Our second order of fries we got as cheese fries and they came served as a huge platter covered every inch in warm delicious gooey cheese. My arteries said no but my mouth said yes yes yes.In addition to the crazy good fries the burgers weren't bad. Didn't blow me away for $15 alone good but decent. Soda was out of a can not a fountain.Table next to us got milk shakes which seemed like a featured item on the menu if I wasn't stuffed from the huge french fry portion I would have loved to try them too." u'The black-N-Blu burger was tasty but the cheese was a bit too thick for the size of the burger....a little overwhelming in taste.' u"I would give the service 4 stars food 3 the prices 2. I was cruising around Hell's Kitchen and this was a bookmarked spot from a yelp newsletter. Naturally I wanted to cross it off my list.It was a warm day so I sat at the bar close to the open doors. It's a small space but typical really. Beer prices weren't bad actually I got the Founders IPA always a good choice. There are quite a few burgers to choose from I ordered the Hobie. I have to echo everyone else the sourdough is an absolute mess but the mess is half the fun. Now the burger the bleu cheese was good but the bacon was cold soggy and limp. The burger itself was big yes but really the flavor wasn't there for me. It was just an average burger and for $15.95 not worth the price tag. If this came with fries or a side perhaps it would be justifiable at that price but the side of fries was $6.50...pass. While it wasn't a bad burger by any means it wasn't a great one either. I have no problem paying more for awesome quality but to me it was just standard. I think I'd pass on a return trip with so many other options in this hood. The bartender was friendly no issues there. But overall I would say just OK." u"for all burger lovers make sure to stop in here! this place is small and narrow but nicely lit with natural light. there's a small bar up front with about 8 seats and the remainder of the restaurant is a long booth with tables and chairs. there's some really cool chalk art along the wall above too (like the entire nyc subway line?!)saturday lunch time had a decent crowd. the menu here literally has something for everyone. for the pre determined burger options you can keep things pretty simple go spicy go decadent (all creep up in price a bit as the toppings keep piling up). also they have tasty beers on tap to enjoy too. my bf and i shared a plate of cheese fries yum! and each got a burger (bourbon st. for him horbie for me). these things were huge and a bit challenging to eat but we cleaned our plates. also the meat temps were perfect! definitely a fan." u"Great lunch spot for $10 burger or chicken sandwich special. It comes with fries and a soda or a brewskie (your choice). The service is really phenomenal here I love how friendly the small staff is. The food always comes out hot and ready definitely consider if you're in the area and need a lunch spot!!" u"Vegetables are delicious - but they extra special when they come on a rare Island Burger! I know it's probably healthier to go vegetarian and perhaps cheaper too but I'm addicted to steaks n'burgers. \xa0Especially the delicious ones I've devoured at Island Burgers. My favorite is their Pepe's (blackened jack cheese guacamole bacon and saut\xe9ed onions) with their South of the Border (Jack cheese salsa guacamole and jalape\xf1o) coming in a close second. But if you don't wanna order one of their many 'specialty burgers' you can build your own. DEFINITELY get an order of their delicious sweet potato fries as they compliment any burger perfectly. The place is pretty small and I recommend sitting up at the counter on the two seats at the front with your back to the window (my regular seat). \xa0They have a daily Happy Hour from 4-7pm. Island has two other locations (Upper West Side and Morningside Heights) both of which I've been to. My favorite though is Hell's Kitchen since I live just a short walk away. One thing that other burger places can learn from Island is how to cook their meat. When I ask for rare the give me rare. When I ask for rare at other burger joints I very rarely (pun non intended) get it rare. Not sure why it's so hard to simply sear a slab of beef on both sides and then flop in between a sesame seed bun but hey I'm no cook just a picky New York eater.Oh and Island's shakes are good too. No need to go wait on the stupid tourist line at Shake Shack and if you've done that before you aren't a real New Yorker." u'This was my go-to place for dinner for a few years. Sometimes 2-3 times during the week. South of the border burger is out of the world. It has jalape\xf1os and guacamole on it :)Shakes are great too. Services is courteous and prompt.' u'One thing my visit to Island Burger has taught me is to call to see if the restaurant is "child friendly". \xa0I picked this restaurant for my book club to meet since I read that it was one of the best places in NYC for a burger. \xa0The menu looked appealing with lots of choices to go with your burger and they offer three different types (beef turkey and chicken). \xa0 I brought my grandson with me (he\'s 7 months) and this restaurant is in NO WAY conducive to bringing a baby with you. \xa0It is very very very small from the time you walk in and almost hit whomever is sitting at the bar with the door you have to fold up the stroller and walk sideways to get to your table. \xa0There is only one restroom and it doesn\'t have a changing table either so parents beware! \xa0I don\'t think I\'ve ever been in a restaurant that small.We made the best out of it and placed our orders - we all ordered the beef burgers. \xa0I ordered mine Medium Well and I have to say that it came out well done which was disappointing. \xa0I had the saut\xe9ed onions and mushrooms with it and cheese. \xa0The burger itself though was very good and not greasy like some restaurants serve it. \xa0It came with the fixins (lettuce tomato onion and pickle). \xa0We shared an order of fries cause there is a lot in the order but the highlight was my black and white milkshake. \xa0It was absolutely delicious! \xa0In fact we all enjoyed our meals and the price that went along with it as for the four of us it came out to about $27 each which included tip.I really like this place and would love to come back but I would definitely have to be "baby less" when I do so!' u"Burger tasted average. Nothing special. The guy working there was really nice but for the price I paid for the quality I don't feel like the place is worth going back to." u"Great burger and so many styles of burgers to choose from. I usually get the Chesky burger which is always good. My friend got the Mona Lisa burger and said it was the best burger he's ever had. The real reason my friends and I keep coming back to this restaurant is the Black & White milk shake which is DELICIOUS. A vanilla shake with chocolate syrup perfectly mixed in." u"I've been to the UWS location a few times and this one once! \xa0Both locations are pretty similar and I've had good experiences at both.At this particular location I had a few beers (more expensive than I like paying but pretty on par with every other place in NYC).I love the asparagus here! YUMMY! I didn't eat anything else during this particular visit but the burgers (beef and chicken) at the UWS location did not disappoint!.The space is pretty small though! We sat at the bar and had to shift a few times to make room for parties as they came and left.Overall its good! Just not somewhere I go often." u'Island Burger is delicious def must try! Made my own custom burger: Bacon Burger w/ pepper jack cheese habanero mayo and spicy bbq with Cajun fries and a black & white shake. My friends got the Route 66 and Blackened Bourbon chicken burgers which came open face style which I heard was just as good. #hellskitchen #midtownlunch' u'**May get pretty busy around lunch time and there is only seating for maybe 20 or so.**I came to Island Burgers & Shakes ready to order some crazy concoction of a burger but after I learned about the amazing $10 lunch special I absolutely had to get it. \xa0For $10 you get a cheeseburger (with your choice of cheese) half an order of fries and a choice of beer or soft drink (only 2 types of canned beer though). \xa0 You also can\'t add any toppings to your burger. \xa0And its CASH ONLY for the lunch special. \xa0With what you get that\'s easily worth around $20 off the regular menu.Burger: asked for medium and it came out medium - yes! \xa0Comes deconstructed with lettuce onion and pickle. \xa0Actually come to think of it I don\'t think there was any tomato on my plate! \xa0I ordered my cheeseburger with blue cheese and it comes with a hefty amount of blue cheese. \xa0I added Tabasco for my own "black and blue" burger. \xa0Burger is charred well and the buns are toasted. \xa0It\'s quite a large patty and has a good char to the outside.Fries: perfectly cooked fries - they were thicker cut fries and were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. \xa0Delicious!! \xa0They know how to do fries the right way.Service: excellent service all around.Solid choice for burgers in Hell\'s Kitchen. \xa0Couldn\'t tell you were the "Island" of Island Burgers and Shakes comes into play though.' u'This place definitely has some interesting burgers. One of a kind I might say. I had been hearing about this place for quite some time so I decided to stroll in during happy hour and try it out.During happy hour you can get yourself beer and/or wine at $5 a glass and 3 sliders for $10. The burgers on the regular menu run from about $10.75 and up so the happy hour is a great alternative to try different types of burgers in one shot. The fries start at $6.75 and up which is pricey for a side of fries but they come in a rather large tin bucket you could probably share. I would highly recommend coming during happy hour to gain some variety on what Island Burger has to offer.My 3 selections were as follows:1)Habanero+Cheddar: this burger was hot as HELL literally. I love spicy food and even I was begging for a glass of water because my soda was not enough. Not bad but too hot for my liking.2)Mozzarella+Honey Mustard: this burger was way more my speed and actually my favorite. Pretty self explanatory and pretty damn good.3)Acapulco (Mexican Spices): this was rather interesting as I would had never thought to put this type of sauce that you might find on an enchilada or something to that nature on a burger. \xa0Not bad!Best burgers in NYC? No but this place will definitely test your palate with things you had probably never thought to put on a burger and I liked it!' u'Golden oldies music in speakers - pretty cool.Mediumwell is more like well and the slices of bread burgers are served with (between) are a bit hard to handle.Tiny cute place. Great service. Full on a Sunday night. We were lucky to get a table for two without reservations.Decent beer selection even on tap.Accepts AMEX' u"The barzel burger was great thick layer of meat and the spice was flavored to a tasty hot sensation. There's a lot of selection to choose from and the background music playing on late Saturday afternoon was great too. \xa0It's a nice cosy place." u'Really good burgers. . Had The Derby \xa0blue cheese and bacon. Restaurant is long and narrow which means limited seating at times. . Very good fries and service was good. People Choice is another buger with swiss mushrooms and alot saut\xe9ed onions(alot.. which is bad for us). . Shake was very good.. had the vanilla. Some craft beer available as well.']
45.Ootoya Times Square,[u"Awesome. You wanna know why? Good service high-quality food and fast despite the full house that particular night. Clean neat and beautiful interior. But be warned Ootoya is a bit pricey. Anyways it's definitely the place for a night out!!The food is superb; 5/5 no questions asked. The sashimi had good texture and wasn't too chewy or fishy. Also if you've never had homemade tofu Ootoya is the place to try it! I can't emphasize enough how tasty it was. It comes with a sauce that will add a bit of flavor to the tofu while it melts in your mouth.The Entr\xe9es come with several sides like steamed egg miso soup vegetables and wasabi. You'll be asked if you'd like to have these sides. I had the Salmon Ikura Don: seared Scottish salmon and salmon roe atop rice. Simple but delicious! We couldn't decide on a dessert so we just ordered the dessert bento which was just all of the desserts put into a bento box. There was green tea ice cream plain cheesecake and mochi. All were superb.Their dinnerware was unique and pretty. Upon asking I was informed that most of their dinnerware is shipped from Japan which I thought was neat. It was definitely an escape from the busy city outside; being inside of Ootoya felt like I wasn't in New York anymore.In conclusion Ootoya is a traditional Japanese restaurant an escape from NY! Their food is top notch and surprisingly speedy. Service was amazing too :)" u'\u4e0a\u624b\u3044\u305e\u30fc\uff01\u5f85\u3064\u305e\u30fc\uff01\u3067\u3082\u307e\u305f\u6765\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3002I love Japanese food! But ootoya  it became popular! Thats why We have to wait about 30 min to 1h Because there are good menu .Chicken kaasanni is my favorite!' u"Ohhh Ootoya how I love you. This is one of those spots where you can ALWAYS expect quality food no matter what location you visit... Yes even in Times Square.We went on a Friday night around 6pm and we waited about 30-40 minutes. Considering this is Times Square for Friday dinner I didn't think it was bad at all. Make sure to put your name down ASAP - the earlier you get there the better.My go-to is the Kaisen Don set... It IS pretty steep (about $40pp) but so worth it. You get EVERYTHING and the egg side dish that comes with the set is pretty phenomenal. I've also had the grilled fish and that was pretty good too. Depending on what you're in the mood for I would recommend either one.I tried the tofu salad for the first time and LOVED it. This is such a unique dish and I loved the combination of the flakes with the tofu. If you're stuck in the area and are wondering if there are ANY good places to eat in Times Square here you go. I would also try their other locations (Greenwich and Chelsea) if you can manage to avoid Times Square. 4.5 stars - highly recommended!" u"Does the food taste good? Sure.Is it anything special? No.Is it overpriced? Yes.Can you find everything they offer for cheaper elsewhere? It's called St. Marks.Highlights: tofu that comes as a side dish with most of the sets yuzu poochi poochi drink and the cute spoonsMy breaded pork don with egg over rice was averagely good but I've had better for more than half the price. Same with the yakitori skewers.Personally I doubt I'll be back but I can't really say anything bad except the price value. Then again it's midtown / almost Times Square area so prices are jacked up a bit. Izakaya shouldn't be priced like that unless it's special. My pork don is like Japanese street food in a nice set presentation." u"Just decided to have lunch near work and to my surprise this location is pretty spacious my wait was under 10 minutes I was on my own so I sat at the bar in front of their semi-open kitchen. Nice customer service just like every other lunch set/don oriented Japanese restaurant.I ordered the Housemade Tofu for appetitzer (because I'm a big fan of housemade tofu) it's too mushy and it wasn't easy to pick up by spoon the sauce was nice and light but slightly too salty together with the bonito flakes. One other place I've had very good housemade tofu was Cocoron and Zenkichi I have to say that Ootoya's tofu is a piece of creamy soy goodness. I loved the flavor but not too much the texture.For entree I got the miso tonkatsu it's served in a hotpot as soon as it came in the pork katsu was still sizzling smelled very good but it's a shame that this miso was way too sweet. I preferred all the cabbage in the meal it soaked up all the miso sauce it's perfect to eat with rice. The pork katsu was not crispy anymore no complaints because it's sitting in a sauce/soup but it's not as tender as I would have liked but I could tell it's a great piece of pork. So? The sauce was just too overwhelming the batter unwrapped itself as I was picking up my katsu because it was too wet. But overall the set was not bad the miso soup was very good not too salty not too light. The chawamushi though was the most smooth and most slippery thing I've ever had how did they make it?? It just slides through my tongue it seemed like they put oil in the egg but hey it's a pretty amazing experience.I will want to try another set next time and dessert." u"Pretty authentic Japanese restaurant. \xa0Most staff seemed to be Japanese and a good amount of patrons were Japanese. \xa0It is in a bit of a touristy area but pretty decent overall. \xa0My friend got the salmon which was one of the best salmon I've had. \xa0I got the oroshi tonkatsu (pork) dish and the meat was well cooked but \xa0the sauce kind of overpowered the taste of the meat. \xa0I'll probably try the plain Tonkatsu next time. \xa0The side egg appetizer that comes with the set was a bit watery and wasn't that warm. \xa0Overall will recommend. \xa0Also no need to pay tip which was convenient." u'Food is very good. The kaisen don comes with a good amount of fish all of which is very fresh. The set comes with chiwanmushi and miso soup which makes for a decent deal. The chicken dishes are also very flavorful. The cocktails are refreshing. The interior is lovely and not crowded despite the Times Square location. For the quality of food the prices are reasonable. Only thing stopping me from giving all out 5 stars is that service can be slow.' u"A gem amidst the Times Square chaos. Incredibly fresh fish and great set menu options. The sparkling sake was very refreshing too.The wait doesn't seem to be as long as they tell you (they have quite a large space and quick service) and it's worth it for high quality Japanese \xa0dining in that area. Typical New York prices for what you get BUT NO TIP (already built into price) so actually perhaps a bit cheaper when all is said and done!" u"Good but not amazing and a little on the pricey side. I had Ootoya bookmarked for my trip to NY. Saw many pictures of this place via fellow instagramers and decided to try the times square location. Came here on a Sunday night and the place was packed. Good thing we came around 8/830pm ish so there wasn't a wait. Restaurant was spacious plenty of seating area. Service was poor our server was not attentive and barely came by to take our orders/ refill water etc. We basically had to wave her down for everything pretty annoying in my opinion. Food wise it was just average. Most items on the menu comes in a set you get a chawanmushi (egg custard) pickles and a very flavourful miso soup. We ordered two sets the Kaisen (Chirashi) Don and the mini Maguro Don. The Kaisen don included an assortment of sashimi. Most of the sashimi was good except the Uni and Salmon Roe. These two did not taste fresh at all and had a very fishy after taste. Honestly tasted like it was a cheap selection of sashimi. The Maguro Don was a lot better with the tuna tasting pretty fresh. The sets don't seem like a lot of food at first but you definitely leave feeling pretty full. Overall the place was good but I don't think it lives up to the hype. It's NY there are plenty of amazing Japanese restaurants around." u"They have several locations but the Times Square location is the most authentic. Lol In terms of having Japanese wait staff but again there are a lot of Japanese clientele in the area.I had eaten at the 18th Street location and wasn't too impressed but had a more memorable dining experience at the Times Square location. Maybe it's all psychological?Went there with a buddy and we ordered the fried shrimp app croquettes app and the Tori Kurozu (like chicken karage with their special sauce). The shrimp and beef/cheese croquettes weren't greasy at all. The Tori Kurozu had more sauce than I would have liked. Next time I'll order sauce on the side for dipping.For entree my buddy ordered the Demi Burger and I had ordered the Katsu Toji. We shared both entrees to sample. After looking at what other people ordered I was skeptical if I would be full splitting the meals but my stomach was quite satisfied and I was not disappointed!! We arrived around 1:15 on a Friday afternoon and had to wait 15 minutes. It was packed with not only tourists but workers in the area. By 2:30 the place had emptied out.I recommend dining at Ootoya no matter what location you stumble across!" u"This is the best Japanese restaurant in Midtown.Although it's triple the price of Ootoya in Japan it's amazing that I can have this in New York." u"Came here with a corporate lunch for a party of four at 11:30am on a Friday which was perfect timing since this place does not take reservations and tends to fill up very quickly during peak lunch hours. I was excited to try this place because I've heard great things and love trying new Asian cuisines and even though everyone loves sushi and Americanized-Japanese food I was eager to try some authentic Japanese food.To begin we had some green tea and their homemade tofu which was great definitely needs the flavor addition of wasabi powder and salt. We also ordered the salmon sushi starters which were unreal. A colleague of mine ordered a vegetable dish that looked tasty someone else ordered the katsu which looked quite decadent (I was definitely in the mood for something a little lighter but definitely for my next visit) and another person and I ordered the mini maguro with hot udon noodles. The tuna was incredibly fresh and the udon noodles were great - I added a lot of the spicy powder for flavor but I like that it's customizable). Our service was very attentive as well! Great experience and will definitely recommend to anyone looking for an adventurous dining experience." u"Ootoya is very very Japanese. The menu consists of the type of food that you would expect a host family in Japan to cook for you. It's simple good quality not overly salty or oily and very comforting. Second there's no tipping but come expecting extremely friendly and attentive service! My friend and I swung by Friday at 8pm and there was no wait for a table of 2. Perhaps because of its slightly hidden location near Times Square crowds don't come rushing here?We each ordered our own kimchi hot pot set ($26) a very heartwarming kimchi stew made with Napa cabbage pork belly (not that fatty) tofu scallions and egg. It came with a side of rice cabbage salad and egg custard (!!). The kimchi hot pot was delicious fairly light even compared to a soondubu from Ktown but so filling! I mainly left my salad untouched as I was already too full. The egg custard on the other hand had the perfect melt-in-your-mouth consistency. My friend was expecting a sweet egg custard so be warned Japanese egg custard is cooked with a savory fish broth. We also tried the shio chicken skin skewer ($5). I haven't had too many good Japanese skewers in the US as they often seem to be associated with cheap late night food (thanks St. Marks) so I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this! The skin was crispy and chewy at the same time with a ton of flavor. Ootoya is such a gem in Times Square I can't wait to come back!" u"Food is alright just don't get a burger! I wasn't sure what I wanted to order so the waitress recommended the burger. She said they use a sauce that came from Japan to cook it so it's very special and really good (of course they always say everything is really good). I was in the mood to try something new so I went with it. To my disappointment the burger came out be a regular beef patty (maybe thicker than usual) cooked in onions and mushroom... and it was really not that special.For the same price I could've gotten myself 5 good burgers from shake shack. Guess I should've picked something that was more Japanese. For a pricey lunch like that I kind of expected more. Picking salmon or chicken might have been a better choice. Don't forget the wait time is about 30 minutes to an hour and they don't take reservations ahead of time. They also won't seat you until your full party is there." u'Great service from the beginning. Good is a bit on the pricier side but everything tasted wonderful. I had the fried chicken cutlet and it was perfect on a bed of hot rice' u'Popular and very busy...even when I came here as soon as the restaurant opened for dinner! They were very accommodating considering we did not have a reservation. I ordered the Hanabi Don and my husband got the Soba. Both were very very good but the price was too much! I want to come back and try more of a variety to sushi/sashimi and then update my review!' u'Slightly pricey with a long wait but the food is amazing and worth it! Went with a friend and ordered two of their set menus. Tried a variety of yakitori and their tofu salad which was really good. My friend ordered the kimchi hotpot and I had the gyu shio koji which is a platter of beef cooked to perfection paired with rice and steamed egg.' u"There are just so many good Japanese restaurants and this place is no exception. We came in around 8 PM and it was at least a 20 minutes wait for seating around the bar. I didn't mind sitting at the corner of the bar though 'cause the three of us were able to converse with each other. The menu has a lot of food listed which made choosing something nearly impossible. Thankfully one of my friends have been there and recommended the soy-sauce infused broth set.I ordered Katsu Toji\xa0and that was so good. I think the broth made the pork lin tender and juicy. I recommend you to get the set because the rice complemented perfectly with the main entr\xe9e. Just thinking back...I could eat rice with the soy-sauce broth by itself too. I wasn't a fan of the tofu side bowl but only because I am so used to that kind of tofu as a dessert dish. Overall I had a wonderful time here and highly recommend it. It is on the pricier side but treat yourself if you have the chance!" u"BLUF: Ootoya is my favorite Japanese chain I'm NYC. Classy setting compared to most Japanese restaurants making it a great place for a meet up with friends or for a date. Make sure you have time to wait or come at a less busy time as Ootoya Times Square only takes reservations at 5:30 PM and is relatively crowded during high time. We arrived here at 10:00 PM and were seated quickly was the kitchen was to close in half an hour. There were plenty of spots as it was near closing time. We placed our orders and then called for a large junmai sake. It was a dry flavorful choice which complemented the ice cold weather outside.For my meal I ordered a Kaisen Don which is an assortment of sashimi blue fin tuna amberjack scallop scottish salmon uni (sea urchin) simmered sea eel salmon roe and egg served atop of sushi rice. The nemo (fish) was some of the freshest I have had in the city. The pieces seemed to just melt in my mouth. The only downside was the imbalance of the fish and the rice. I was left with a lot of sweet sushi rice which I didn't have anything to eat with. However this was still a filling meal.The meal for two cost $80+tip so no small change but was worth the evening with superb service and food.Definitely will be returning to this location or the one in East Village. I absolutely love Ootoya." u"Ooooomg. WHY can't this exist next door. SO delicious. So worth it. Phenomenal quality and taste. Beautiful precise presentation. Service is more Japanese style than American so don't put too much weight on it but honestly once you see and taste the food you could hardly give a shit.The amberjack is one of the highlights of my life. Sex in my mouth.Their cocktails were light and refreshing great palate whetter. Yakitori were excellent starter bites and expertly done. My friend and I both got the Kaisendon and we were almost crying and orgasming at the same time while eating. It was a sight. Service was sub-par-ish but honestly I couldn't give a flying one. Really. They could berate me next time and I would still come back."]
207.Blue Dog Kitchen Bar,[u'Came here on a great breakfast date! The latte was delicious. I had egg whites with cheese and sausage on a croissant. This was impeccable and came with a side of potatoes and a small mixed greens salad. A very filling meal.Delicious food and excellent service!' u'lunch take out reviewordered over the phone at 11:45am on a Wednesday. Got there around 12:10pm and waited till 12:45pm to leave with the food. yes it took them an hour to prepare my order. They gave us green juice while we were waiting.I ordered an omelette which was fine. I think it\'s fair that they allow 5 choices. It also includes a small salad and potatos.My friend ordered the steak and eggs and when we got back THERE WERE NO EGGS. they even had "over easy" (which is what we ordered) on the receipt!!White truffle fries had a very strong truffle aroma and taste which is good.The food in general is not bad in fact I don\'t mind going again just for the food. But the wait + the absense of the eggs on a Steak and Eggs order is unacceptable. Go if they are not busy.' u"The food here is really good! Service was good and attentive. I got the Blue Dog Burger.. the patty is a big unique and seasoned with pepper and is slightly different than a traditional burger patty. It's a bit hard to eat since the burger gets really thick with all the toppings.. The fries were okay nothing special but not the worst. I've also tried the pancakes here and they're a lot fluffier than other places! The syrup isn't overly sweet so you can be generous with the amount. Overall good service and good food but... we did have to wait 45 minutes for our food -- which was a bit ridiculous. Wish I could give it a higher rating." u'Really bummed about my experience here. This was one of those small NYC restaurants where they try to cram as many tables and seats as they can to get as many tickets as they can in. We were 3 ppl and were seated at a small thin rectangular bar-like "table" with another solo diner who sat at one end. We were so crammed in. Because of the large community table right by us people\'s chairs were always bumping into our backs. It\'s definitely a fire hazard. Also We got seated at 2:15 pm and our food arrived at 2:55 pm. Just another testament to how they\'re way too overpacked. The food was mediocre too. Overall a bummer.' u"I was really disappointed with this place. The wait was insanely long for six people - over an hour and a half!! The food was also incredibly mediocre. I ordered the frittata (at our server's recommendation) and it tasted like the egg patty on a McDonald's breakfast sandwich. I normally do not add extra salt and pepper to my restaurant dishes but I had to load up on the seasonings in order to make the frittata even a little bearable. The side salad was also meh. Grocery store mixed greens in vinaigrette. Very underwhelming.My total came out to over $20. All for a sub-par brunch.I will give props to the free banana bread and jam which was very yummy. It was the only thing I enjoyed about this experience.Given the plethora of delightful brunch spots in New York do yourself a favor and skip Blue Dog." u"Extremely packed on weekends especially brunches. Expect to wait we waited about 20 minutes which gave us more than enough time to read the menu and pick what we want. Everyone is practically shoulder to shoulder. There is a big community table in the middle that is where we sat on a corner spot so we felt like were constantly in the way. \xa0If you're lucky you can get the tables by the window! There is no where for the waiters/waitresses to stand so they are constantly dancing around each other and standing extremely close to those enjoying their meals. Our food and drinks were really delicious though and I think well worth the wait and chaos! I had the Pumpkin Stuffed Toast with the blackberry glaze which thanks to Yelp Reviews was the reason I chose it. It is a big think piece of toast stuffed with creamy sweet delicious pumpkin! Drizzled with a blackberry glaze which was a nice touch instead of syrup. Both my mom and my sister enjoyed their meals and specialty drinks. For as crowded and busy as they were food came out quickly and service was quick and friendly!One thing that I loved though is the banana bread appetizer they bring out for you. This is complimentary and is delicious and a very smart idea! I think more restaurants need to do this. People can get very hangry while waiting for brunch and this offsets the hangry comments that can come with a packed restaurant nice job Blue Dog!" u"2.5 stars. Pros:* Cute and homey decor* Excellent and friendly staff. When we weren't happy with the pancakes our waiter Aaron immediately apologized and had the kitchen fix us a new plate. At its busiest times the food came out quickly we had our own water carafe and Aaron came by to check on us several times.* Enjoyed our Crabs Benedict (maryland crab cakes tarragon hollandaise poached eggs english muffin) everything was cooked well and there were tons of flavor. * Huge menu with a plethora of options* Delicious complimentary banana bread with jamCon:* Extremely packed on weekends especially brunches. Expect to wait between 35 min to an hour. During brunches everyone is practically shoulder to shoulder. If you're lucky you can get the tables by the window where there is a little bit more breathing room.* If you like your pancakes light and fluffy I do not recommend Blue Dog's Chocolate Chip Pancakes (with whipped ricotta lime creme which I personally did not like together). I'm not sure if it was just a bad batch of batter... but these pancakes were super heavy condensed and had the consistency of playdoh. Just terrible I took one bite and could not eat the rest. Honestly McDonald's pancakes are way more delicious.Tip:* Make sure to stand near the entrance to hear the hostess our names were called twice but we never heard anything! * I would return for weekday lunches and dinners to avoid the crowds." u"I went here with some friends to check it out and noticed they had a pasta dish. Probably my fault for getting a pasta dish from a brunch place but that's what I was craving.Spaghetti Primavera: Nothing worth raving about. 2.5/5Now let's talk about that banana bread. SO. GOOD. I could eat that as an entree. I could eat it for life. What would I bring if I was stranded on an island and could only have one thing on me? Their banana bread. I might be hyping it up too much but still it's uber tasty.Our waitress was friendly and so the 4/5 is for the free banana bread and service." u'Yum yum YUM! My fianc\xe9 and I were looking for a nice place for brunch before our flight back to Los Angeles. I do not understand why brunch seems to be reserved for only the weekend. I for one am an avid supporter of breakfast/brunch availability all day every day forever. Blue dog you came to our rescue! I called them on Friday morning and they said breakfast was available until 4 PM. Say whaaaaat?!? This gem of a restaurant was a 15 minute walk away from our hotel in the heart of the theater district. It is a bit small but fine for us. We like intimate spaces. Upon entry we were greeted warmly and kindly and seated immediately. We were given fresh walnut bread and jam! Fianc\xe9 devoured it. I sadly I have a nut allergy so watched him in envy. Each of us got a delicious coffee. I opted for the salted caramel latte. He got the white chocolate raspberry latte. Both were delicious. We each ordered a breakfast item and decided to split them. I got the traditional eggs Benedict. He got the chocolate chip pancakes. Holy. Cannoli. Both were portioned generously and everything was delicious. Eggs were perfectly poached hollandaise was fresh and the English muffin was warm and toasty. Those house potatoes were epic. And the pancakes! Totally stuffed with chocolate chips topped with a generous portion of lime cr\xe8me. I make chocolate chip pancakes at home and I bow down to Blue dog. The pancakes may have been the best I have ever had. Our server was incredibly kind refilling our waters often and got us extra plates so we could split our food. We were full and happy customers. Well done Blue dog we are totally coming back the next time we visit NYC!' u"I am literally so happy I found this place I can't stop talking about it. It's just so good! I haven't left a brunch place this happy in awhile.I'm tired of going to a brunch place and having the same boring options of pancakes or eggs benedict. At Blue Dog while there are still pancakes & French toast & all that good stuff they make it unique and creative!I ordered the Grilled Avocado and my sister ordered the Crunchy French Toast. Both to die for! We split our dishes in half so I got to try both and they were both well-made and had nice presentation on the plate.We sat at the bar because even though we went here on a Wednesday morning it was pretty packed! That's okay though (it just means it's popular -- and good!) so we decided the bar would give us the most elbow-room (all the other seating is very close together). The bartender was very nice and made my sister a great iced latte and me the Blue Dog Brew (which was sooo good if you like chai!)They have so many delicious looking dishes that'll have to come back again and try more of them out! Their juices looked really good too so I'll have to try those too. Highly recommended! Come here during the week for less crowds!!" u'We LOVED this place. Found it through Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews. It\'s a tiny place with communal tables and just a few private tables but the food and service are amazing! We went for brunch and the chocolate chip pancakes were like giant cookies but so wonderful (no syrup required) I had a simple veggie sandwich that was full of flavor and the omlette was filled with fresh (pick your own) ingredients with a side of simple herb potatoes. But the star of the show was truffle fries. You smell them as you walk in and they were the best I have had (and I am a truffle fry expert!). Our waiter was fun friendly helpful and attentive. Would have loved for him to sit and eat with us - he was that much fun! Highly recommend as it is off the beaten path of the Times Square madness. It\'s pricey (as is everything in the area). It gets busy so be ready to wait or do what we did and eat at an "off" time. Make it a must see on your new trip to the City!' u'Second time here. First time was great...but this time...Disappointing wait after host messed up and skipped us.. Finally seated and my husband orders a Bloody Mary that never came until our food arrived. Food was good although the portions are small and the prices are high. \xa0Too many places in midtown to try.. Skipping this one next time.' u"Great service and gold was delicious wasn't too far from my hotel order foods and wasn't long to be served and got a good cappuccino to wake me up decent price" u'It pains me to write this review as I was really looking forward to a great brunch experience based on the reviews I read. My first mistake was not reading through the reviews as throughly as I should have. My second mistake was ordering a salad.I got the "Caribbean Cobb salad". My plate consisted mostly of wilted romaine lettuce in addition to a few sprinkles of blue cheese 4 cherry tomato halves and 3 small pieces of cucumber with a drizzle of balsamic vinegarette--is this a Cobb salad?????? Or a salad worth less than the $2.99 bagged salads from the grocery store (that would have tasted much better)? The mango that was supposed to be on the salad was missing--I pointed this out to the server and she kindly gave me a side of it. Overall the most disappointing restaurant experience I have had in my 6 years in this city. The service was average--I expressed my concern with the salad tony server and she offered to give me some banana bread to go home with (which I declined). $14.00 for a plate of wilted greens was just not worth it--see my attached picture if you don\'t believe me. ***Elizabeth--thanks for your comment. Yes it was on Thursday April 21st. (Sorry I couldn\'t directly reply to your comment).' u'I\'m usually fairly lenient on pick up and delivery orders but my experience at Blue Dog was unfortunately poor. I ordered for pick up with a friend around 11:45 and we were told to come by in twenty minutes. We did so and were informed it would be right out in two minutes which is fine I realize sometimes the timing is a bit off. I usually give up to 15 minutes leeway due to busy kitchens and what not. In total we waited about 40 minutes.To their credit a waiter nearby checked in on the order and assured us it was almost done multiple times. They even provided a free "green drink" part way through our wait. Nonetheless that was an unacceptably long time from the estimate that was provided.What made this whole process worse however was my actual food order. I ordered steak and eggs and somehow the eggs were left out. I can make a lot of excuses for missing items; maybe they heard incorrectly on the phone or there was a mixup in the six items I chose for an omelette. But you cannot forget one of the primary components in the NAME of the dish. This is like leaving out the avocado in avocado toast.In terms of the food I actually got I would say the steak was pretty high qualiy. It had a nice sear and was a solid medium rare as I requested. I thought the chimichurri was a bit weak so at times it left some bites a bit bland. For the price point though it was fair and generally pretty good. I liked the truffle fries we ordered. They had a strong truffle taste to them which I often find missing. $8 for a box of potatoes though was a bit excessive. I am not adverse to trying Blue Dog again but I am not likely to ever do delivery or pickup.' u"On a gloomy Sunday afternoon we decided to have brunch in Midtown West and stumbled upon Blue Dog. \xa0By the time we arrived there was already a line out the door partially because the restaurant is an extremely tight space. \xa0After waiting about 30 minutes which was what they accurately estimated we were seated at a small table with barely enough room to flare my elbows out ... not that anybody should have their elbows out when eating lol.Besides the cramped space there was nothing else negative to say about Blue Dog maybe other than the dry fries that came with the Blue Dog burger. \xa0I ordered the cured salmon platter and loved every bite of it especially the salmon and the fresh minimally dressed yet appetizing salad. \xa0I was so glad they didn't overload my bagel with cream cheese like most places do because I end up removing 80% of it anyway. \xa0We also ordered cappuccinos and loved the froth and bold espresso components.Service was also very friendly quick and attentive. \xa0Forgot to mention while we were all waiting outside for a table we were offered some homemade apple spice soup of some sort to keep warm. Thoughtful no?" u"Blue Dog was the best brunch I've had in awhile ! *claps hands  ok NYC I see you !* if you live in NYC and you haven't eaten here  what are you waiting for? I'm shocked this little eatery doesn't have five stars  although our wait was a little long. We had warm apple cider to keep us going until we were seated at a very small table in an extremely tight seating area I didn't count but I would say not more than 35 people could dine at at time ? As we waited the waiter gave us a few pieces of pumpkin bread and banana nut bread to munch on  deeeeliiiiccciiious . I ordered the steak and eggs with potatoes and the steak had the best flavor I've had in awhile . If I come to new York I will definitely come back to try everything else on Blue Dog's menu." u'Really cute spot! Decor was homey and they had rat pack and 50s music playing the background which I love! Came here for brunch on st.pattys day for the first time and was seated immediately even having a party of 6 with me. The drinks were really well made and the selection they had was unique. Affordable esepcially for the city. Complimentary banana bread and jam.Portions were decent you could tell that everything was fresh however not the most seasoned especially the salads and the avocado eggs Benedict. I would def go back even if it were to just have some drinks. The servers were very accommodating and polite.' u"The morning I went to Blue Dog I had landed in NYC around 9am and was starving. I opened the Yelp mobile app in search of a great brunch and a place that was open early. After scanning the photos of this place I knew it was the right choice.One important thing to note: it's tiny. Very tiny. Do not go here if that's going to bother you... there was a lot of bumping into people and trying to stay out of the way while waiting for a table. In my opinion that's the best part about the rush of being in New York City. The host was very kind and had a table ready for us about ten minutes after we got there. We ended up moving over to the bar when two spots opened because the air coming in from the front door was freezing us.They make a good bloody here! It wasn't spicy enough and didn't have a kick at first but we got some horseradish on the side which made us happy campers. For my meal I had the eggs benedict with avocado - it was fresh healthy and those potatoes on the side didn't stand a chance. I can't imagine this place on the weekends - go during the week for sure. It's a beautiful little space and I would definitely go back again." u'Stepping through the thick glass passage into the wondrous land of breakfast I was greeted by a dimly lit and clean yet homely interior. Blue walls are lined with vines intertwining with Christmas lights; a lovely touch that compliments large glass panes that allow natural light to penetrate this kitchen bar. The service was extremely accommodating and this made the breakfast experience all the better.I chose to go half-and-half with a friend on the crunchy French toast and the steak & eggs. When my food arrived I was so eager to dive into my meal that I neglected to take a picture ;( but take my word for it the presentation was lovely. The French toast was coupled with caramelized bananas that left me in awe. While I must say that the steak was a tad too tough for my tastes the French toast was absolutely stunning. The added crunch was a fresh unique take on a classic recipe. Wonderful breakfast. A-.']
48.Etcetera Etcetera,[u'I went for a 6:45pm reservation for restaurant week. I was a little early but I was seated immediately. My waitress Chiara and the assistant waiters were amazing. I was attended to quickly and checked on regularly but not too much. \xa0If I needed someone they were there before I needed to look for someone. The food was delicious! \xa0I started with the Breasola. I just wish I had a sharper knife. It was the perfect amount. I then had the pan roasted chicken with potatoes and broccoli rabe. Everything was flavorful (no need to add salt or pepper). There were bitter pieces of broccoli rabe but I love broccoli rabe so that is to be expected. I finished with sorbet/gelato (vanilla pistachio and mango-passion fruit). I added a hot tropical green tea which was a perfect ending to the meal. According to one of the waiters they also have a pre-fixe menu everyday so get into it!' u'With a name like Etcetera Etcetera one would expect this establishment to have a whimsical quality of sorts. Perhaps it would have an eclectic menu fusing together several cultures and/or areas of the globe. Maybe it would feature a slightly rustic but classy decor with quirky servers clad in button-down shirts traversing the aisles on scooters.But this place exhibits none of the above which makes the name choice quite bewildering.One walks in to Etc. Etc. and is greeted by a young adult dressed in a fashionable but casual manner but beyond this point one sees a dimly lit space dominated by square tables and chairs laid out in typical grid fashion. Plates silverware and napkins are of the usual variety. Personally I felt like I was immediately entering another dimension of sorts.As for the members of the waitstaff they are all identically dressed in a standard uniform. On the whole their body language and speech is quite formal. If you were to leave your during the meal you would return to your seat to find your napkin perfectly folded and placed in the exact center of your eating area. Yes it is *that* type of place. One might ask whether or not the "Etc. Etc. Elements" are part of the menu but in my humble opinion the answer to that question is largely a no. The "Handmade crescenza ravioli with fava beans oven dried tomatoes basil oil and pecorino" (half portion $18) was indeed tasty but hardly inventive. Furthermore the "Handmade potato gnocchi with pistachio-arugula pesto french beans and stracciatella cheese" (half portion $19) was dominated by the taste of the pesto. While I think pesto is delicious it completely overpowered the French beans and stracciatella cheese to the point where they should have simply been removed. Their best tasting dish in our group\'s opinion was the "Homemade gluten-free tagliatelle" ($28) with tomato sauce and vegetables which was prepared pretty much according to its name: pasta and vegetables cooked with tomato sauce.The reader may be wondering why I am being particularly picky with this establishment. The two main reasons are price and portion size. The "half" portion appears to be a fraction of a "full" one and yet is disproportionately more than half the price. At $16-20 for half portions and $24-29 for full portions one would expect a certain uniqueness in plating technique or introduction of more complex flavors or ingredients. Indeed their pasta being homemade is quite flavorful and the ingredients used are fresh and top-notch. However these positive points along with the restaurant\'s tourist-filled prime location near the bright lights of the Theater District do not give Etc. Etc. a free pass to avoid inventiveness which is generally expected for a restaurant of this caliber in Midtown Manhattan. In any case I would not dismiss Etcetera Etcetera completely and would say that it is worth a try if you are in the area.' u"I'm not usually jazzed about Midtown restaurants in general but this one turned out to be a great choice for us since we needed to catch a Broadway show. \xa0 I loved the fact that it was upscale but non-commercial and our dinner service was friendly and efficient. \xa0This particular evening we went all out. \xa0After walking around for 8+ hours we were ready to eat a house and didn't hold back. \xa0For starters we shared the warm octopus salad the baby arugula salad and the complimentary focaccia bread with olive tapenade. \xa0All disappeared from our table into our bellies within 5-10 minutes. \xa0 Portions are huge too! \xa0I especially enjoyed the octopus as it was so tender. \xa04.5/5 \xa0The arugula salad hit the spot as well and would be a 5/5 if it was just a tad less salty. \xa0For our mains I had the grilled artic char with the lobster mashed potatoes and broccolini but also shared a half order of the basil spaghetti with lump crab. \xa0 OMG what a huge portioned entree but hey I still managed to clean off that entire dish. \xa0The char was coated with a nice crunchy herb coating and cooked ever so perfectly. \xa0I also loved their version of the lobster mashed as well. \xa0I believe they used sweet potatoes as opposed to regular white potatoes and the broccolini was tasty and snappy. \xa04/5I probably could've passed on the spaghetti with crab though. \xa0It wasn't bad but wasn't memorable either. \xa0The sauce just didn't have much kick to it and the pasta could've been cooked more al dente. \xa03/5For desserts we shared a trio of gelattos/sorbets and the risotto cheesecake. \xa0The dark chocolate and lemon flavors were a great hit while the cheesecake was noticeably underwhelming. \xa0You can tell that wasn't made in-house. \xa0Overall a winner. \xa0If you have to dine around the Broadway area this is must try!" u'This restaurant didn\'t nail a single aspect of service with the unique exception of the support staff who were admittedly spectacular. If these 4 & 5 star reviews are coming from New Yorkers their standards are low and my local denizens are doing the community a disservice.I will say that the support staff was exceptional-warm hospitable and attentive.Our server was abysmal and after we informed him that we weren\'t having drinks could not have been less interested in us. When he got around to taking our order he informed us that they were out of fried green tomatoes (absolutely understandable-I work in restaurants and am fully aware that items get 86\'d). That said he felt the need to elaborate and tell us that they had been 86\'d for weeks... Guys reprint the menus or at the very least tell guests when they start looking at the menu when an item isn\'t available it\'s a win/win no? I certainly don\'t recommend winging it and telling the guest that "green tomatoes aren\'t good right now" because it\'s tomato season...The fusilli with seasonal vegetables was embarrassing-I cannot imagine a chef in New York City being proud of the insult of a dish that arrived and the audacity to charge $24 for dried pasta drizzled with frozen vegetables would be impressive if it weren\'t so offensive.We saw our server zero times throughout the meal. We tried to order a soda which we watched dying on the service bar for about 5 minutes before a member of the service staff was able to run it; and despite the tiny (50+ seat?) dining room had to flag him down to get the check. I hadn\'t planned on writing a Yelp review and had hoped to speak with the manager on the way out but she was nowhere to be seen.Etcetera Etcetera wouldn\'t survive a month if it weren\'t for the location. Talented chefs and restauranteurs are struggling to create innovative concepts all over Manhattan and I would rather support any of their efforts in ANY other neighborhood than to reward in the laziness of the chef and team of Etcetera Etcetera.' u"Wow. I can't say enough good things about this place. The gluten free pasta was amazing. It is a homemade recipe and you can tell. The flavors in each dish were bold and delicious. Can't wait to come back!" u"Prior to coming here for restaurant week I had never heard of Etcetera Etcetera. My friend and I had made reservations for 730 but had arrived early so we took a seat at the bar and got some drinks. Being the end of a work day we both desperately needed drinks and wanted to get buzzed before dinner.The bartender seemed a bit busy but was still able to attend to us. My friend was able to decide what she wanted immediately amaretto soda. While I was being nitpicky and couldn't commit to anything. My eyes eventually spotted the Vesper a classic James Bond cocktail and I had to have it. I had tried making it before and failed spectacularly. Etcetera Etcetera's version was delicious and very strong. Major kudos to the restaurant for having this classy drink on the menu for pretentious people like me. Ordering from the prefixe menu for Restaurant week we had the Grilled Portobello Mushroom and Potato leek and saffron soup to start. The mushrooms were delicious and made me regret ordering something else. The Soup was not particularly spectacular. I expect a cream soup with saffron to have a different hue than what the soup actually had. For our main dishes we ordered the Pan roasted sea bass with eggplant caponata and olive oil mashed potatoes & Mascarpone and spinach ravioli with sweet butter and sage. The sea bass was pretty unique and had a great flavor to it. I do wish that the skin was a bit crispier. The Ravoli were plump bursting with flavor. I did wish for a bit more ravolis though. It seemd a bit lacking on the plate compared to the Sea BassFor the dessert we ordered the Selection of homemade gelato and sorbetto & Homemade apple tart with vanilla caramel and whipped cream. Since I don't really remember the flavors that we ordered I'll assume that it was not spectacular. The apple tart however was excellent. It was a skinned apple that was caramelized on top of a pastry. I loved the fact that instead of using sliced apples they kept the apple in one piece and caramelized the whole thing. The pastery however was a bit hard. Even though it offered a textural difference it seemed way too out of place. Cutting through the apple to hard pastry resulted in the knife cutting through and hitting the plate really hard. Overall Etcetera Etcetera is a solid restaurant pick. The drinks are strong the food is solid and the ambiance and staff are excellent." u'This place was fantastic! Service was impeccable which to me is 50% of my dining experience. It\'s like the staff could read my mind! While on vacation we had dinner here before seeing "Phantom of the Opera" in the theater district and I booked this place because it was a block away. The decor is beautiful and the food was excellent! I had gnocchi with pistachio/arugula pesto. It was divine! My daughter had a veal ravioli of which my husband and I were both jealous! Even their bread was better than most restaurants. It was a wonderful memorable meal. It\'s a slam dunk and they cater to the theater crowd so they get you in and out as fast or slow was you want. Don\'t miss this place if you\'re in town!' u'Ahhh Etcetera Etcetera...This restaurant is so aptly named as it really is just like rest. I really wanted to like this place but it\'s yet another cliche Theater District Italian restaurant serving average food with above average prices. My fellow Yelpers may be using the phrase "hidden gem" a bit too fast and loose on this one.Came here on a Friday night with the SO prior to watching Curious Incident. After enduring the hell that is Times Square to make our 6pm reservation we were greeted by the host and were immediately seated. The interior has a relatively modern feel -- very clean grey tones throughout with some heavy red accents a contemporary back-lit bar along with some bizarre rugs and other decor (which looked like haphazardly rolled/folded bed sheets) lining the walls. All together the aesthetics were a bit odd but nothing to make a fuss about. To start the SO went with a sav blanc ($11) and I ordered the Old Fashioned ($16). While she liked the wine I was unimpressed by the cocktail. In the spirit of Halloween the orange peel and a cherry were frozen inside a brain-shaped ice cube. I was unimpressed. I\'m usually all for novelty but not when it compromises the flavor of the drink especially one so expensive. When in doubt keep the cocktails simple please. For our dishes we shared the following:Burrata ($17) - Really fresh and tasty. The pesto and balsamic really worked well together.Brussel Sprouts ($9) - Decent. Cooked well not too oily. Served with pancettaSquid Ink Pasta w/ Lobster ($27) - Bland city. While the dish looked great (the head and tail in my pic are just shells to pretty it up) the flavors were completely muted. Couldn\'t even really taste the lobster meat.Sea Scallops ($30) - Good not great. Bacon wrapping was a nice touch. No major qualms with this dish other than the price. Four scallops for $30 is a bit too steep to me.As for the service it was unusual. We had three different servers throughout the evening which made it a bit confusing who to ask questions to or look to for drink refills. That said all the servers were still quite friendly and gracious. We skipped dessert and the check came out to $160 with tax and tip. That number includes two wines and a cocktail as well but even so it\'s way too hefty a bill given the mediocre quality of the food. If I do come here again which is very unlikely maybe I\'ll give the prix fixe menu a try for $38. But if the meal we had is any indicator it\'s probably just as underwhelming.' u'Great Food and outstanding friendly service. \xa0the Hosts and Hostess worked together with the service staff to provide the outstanding customer service experience. \xa0I had the Tuna tartar for appetizer and I tried my friends Calamari both were delicious and fresh. for dinner I had the Grilled Steak cook to perfection. I had a reservation for Five however after the show three of my friends bailed out; I was very impress that the Hots and Hostess were very understanding and still gave us a friendly welcoming into their establishments I went back after leaving the table to thank them for being so understanding. The place was fairly busy at Six pm however we still got very efficient service. a Total treasure in the heart of NYC I will definitely be back and recommend to others.' u'I found this gem in the heart of Theater District a neighborhood that is sadly packed with mediocre chain restaurants and other tourist traps. Etcetera Etcetera is a traditional Italian restaurant that caters to diners seeking pre-dinner cocktails pre- or post-theatre dinners business lunch large group events etc. etc. (no pun intended...).I had an early dinner (5:30pm) here as I had to go to a show at 7pm. The receptionist told us that we may be right on time for the show and indeed he was right. We arrived around 5:40 ordered the food at 6 received the entrees at 6:25 (a little bit on the slow side) ordered/received the dessert around 6:45 and was out the door and in our seats at Something Rotten by 7:05pm!I got the full-portion of the Squid Ink Tagliolini ($27) with lobster fresh tomato shallots and basil. You also have the option of getting an appetizer portion for $18. While the dish did not have as much lobster meat as I had hoped the pasta was cooked nicely (could have been slightly more al dante). I wish they had spinach pasta because that is my absolute favorite. The pasta could have been wider for more texture :)I also got a side of Polenta Fries ($9). I loved the crispy outside and the softer savory polenta inside. I would highly recommend it but 4 pieces for $9 is a bit pricey.' u'This is an intimate Italian restaurant with dim lighting and mood music making it perfect for a date night place. We came with another couple who we were seeing on our final night in NYC. The food was pretty good. There was a decent selection of gluten free plates. I opted for the gnocchi with bolognaise. It kind of got a little monotonous after the sixth mouthful and It definitely could have been hotter in temperature. The vegetables were great. There were plenty of them and they were well cooked. The food just needed a little something else to take it from good to great.Having said this though this was the perfect choice of restaurant in the end because after the meal we were left to chat for as long as we liked. We felt no pressure to leave and the staff were friendly. It even encouraged us to go for dessert which aside from the company was actually the best bit of the meal.' u"I was blown away! A very classy place with amazing food! It's very pricy but it was worth it for the quality and portion you got. The menu is in Italian and they had an enormous wine selection. I would definitely come back!" u"A guest recommended this restaurant and she was right! The gnocchi were amazing and unique! In a pesto sauce with green beans was a great combination! I had a half portion so I could have cauliflower \xa0augratin as a side and that was also tasty and different. The service was impeccable and I topped my meal off with a dark chocolate gelato and Italian cookies that I had to take home because too full. A must try place! The only negative was they don't take Discover credit cards" u'The food and service are really quite good. Pastas all fresh made salads tasty entrees adequate size well seasoned. I was guest of others who really like it. \xa0The prix fixed menu is good value (I had just salad & pasta but sampled my companions.) etcetera just lacks a wow factor. It meets a three star standard. \xa0But I yearned for fresh grated cheese not just black pepper. \xa0The decor is ordinary.Good place - just not great.' u"Loved it - definitely coming back to this hidden gem! Fantastic dinner experience here from the super attentive service and romantic decor (roses on all the tables) to the tasty food & wine (we really enjoyed the Cabernet Sauvignon here).To start we got the grilled octopus salad appetizer - wonderful flavor and tasted surprisingly like grilled chicken...For entrees my bf got the Cornish Hen and I got the Half portion of the Veal ravioli plus a side of Brussels sprouts with pancetta. (Tip: the half portion of ravioli is 5 pieces - the full is 9 pieces.) Best ravioli I've had with a non-cheese based filling.We both really enjoyed the food though it was very oily...didn't feel like having dessert after! I was glad I ordered the Half size - perfect amount for a satisfying meal if you add a side of veggies." u"Came here for a group meeting. We took a half of the upstairs; the other side was a very rowdy noisy group so difficult to do a meeting - keep that in mind if you split upstairs or have something more conversational going on as opposed to just friends hanging out.We had a pre fixe menu that had a couple salads chicken salmon or lasagna for the main and a dessert.The salad nothing exciting there - it was a slightly bitter set of greens with a vinaigrette with a prawn on top that was slightly singed. The lasagna was the envy of those around me who picked chicken or salmon - much better choice to go Italian here and not the bland salmon or chicken apparently.The dessert - I asked for a nut mousse and got a tiramisu. I don't have coffee... so thumbs down for me.Service was great though drinks and water kept filled up and a quick set of plates gone when finished. So come here enjoy the Italian food and don't get the vanilla chicken or fish." u"Whenever we are in the neighborhood we don't miss a chance to dine at Etcetera Etcetera. The staff is courteous and efficient the food so wonderful and the atmosphere delightful. I've enjoyed a number of different menu selections and specials and have NEVER been disappointed nor have my guests (but I confess the risotto con funghi is a favorite!). Make plans to visit now!" u"I would give this place 5 stars if it was less expansive. Decor is classic and smart. It would do well in a date situation business meeting or even elegant lunch with the family. The Gluten Free options are superb. This is the first place I know of that serves gluten free gnocchi and ravioli and does it really well! Like reminds me of food in Italy kind of well!I ordered the gluten free butter and basil gnocchi. The plate was middle to large size and I wiped it clean. The ingredients were simple and basic and I was missing something in the dish because I generally like more complex flavors. My husband had the spinach filled gluten free ravioli and to me they were also simple but good in true Italian fashion. Service was good. Nothing stood out which is a good thing.The only thing I didn't like was the price tag. I think $30 is a lot for a pasta dish even with gluten free premium included. With that said I wouldn't mind going back." u'I definitely recommend this place for dinner! My boyfriend and I came after catching a Broadway show and have vowed to return since. They have quality bottles on their wine list (we discovered a favorite here) and all of the food was delicious. I recommend trying the ravioli!' u'We went for Restaurant week. The service was attentive and they were able to change the prix fixe menu to accommodate me (I\'m vegetarian). I had the portobello salad the spinach ravioli and the apple tart.The salad was...as good as a salad can get I suppose. The ravioli was great although not very filling but very savory. My friends all got the seabass which they said was excellent. The apple tart was disappointing. Honestly it was not even as good as the apple dessert at McD\'s very disappointing.All in all it was a good experience but thoroughly underwhelming. Nothing really made me say "Wow." It was all just...nice which is not a terrible thing but there\'s not really a reason to go back.']
86.Wondee Siam,[u"There's good Thai and great Thai. This is probably as good as you get in the area without spending a lot more $.. Penang curry was perfectly spiced - very balanced flavours and curiously addictive. The BBQ chicken was well presented and subtle. Slightly undercooked for my taste but that was rectified very quickly without fuss.Service was attentive and very very polite. Recommended." u'Came here with my Thai friend who ordered the atypical dishes off the specialty menu. The food was ok but the two stars reflect the 3 cockroaches that we found crawling around our table at the end of he meal 1 of which was on her. I know it NY but Dayamn I can not go back here.' u'Once of the mainstays in Thai Town is Wondee Siam. This place has multiple locations actually.My coworker and I came here to the 9th Avenue and 52nd Street location for a quick $8 lunch during a slow day at work. Each lunch special comes with a pair of vegetable spring rolls to start.Not bad. Good crisp not too oily but just a bit too temperature hot. Careful you don\'t burn your mouth.I got the pad see ew which I believe is commonly referred to as "drunken noodle." It is a wide flat noodle stir fried with Chinese broccoli and tossed with a choice of protein. I went with chicken.This was pretty good! For $8 you really can\'t go wrong. The sauce clung to the noodles and chicken the dish was not greasy and the broccolini was cooked properly. I\'d hit this joint again most definitely.My coworker however might not be as keen on returning. He ate the pad thai and said he shit his brains out promptly upon returning to the office. Oh well. I was fine.' u"Cool little Thai restaurant with a minimalist vibe and a rustic kitchen that knows how to cook. Don't let the small space fool you the menu really has a lot to offer. We took the staff's suggestion on the appetizers and ordered the chive pancakes and curry puff. The pancakes were crispy and sizzling as they came out but on the inside fill with chives they have a soft glutinous texture; this was a must-try in my opinion. For entree I tried the Pad Kra Pow with sauteed beef (I regret not trying the popular minced pork option it was suggested by the waitress). The emphasis for the Pad Kra Pow was the taste of chili paste and basil which accentuated the rest of the ingredients.Spacing was very limited here we had to shift around from one side to the other because our table of 4 was getting in the way of foot traffic. However our waitress was extremely accommodating on a busy weeknight and reseated us in a more spacious and comfortable arrangement. If anyone wonder whether they are related to the Wondee Siam in UWS they are actually two separate establishments." u"We waited for an hour before getting seated but it's totally worth it. My friends and I both tried both this place and Pure Thai and love both - here is the major difference between them though - this place cooks popular Thai dishes ;like pad thai pad see-ew but it does such a good job that people still want to go here to eat them. So we ordered so many dishes and all of them were soooooo good. I must point out that appetizers here are exceptionally good - you must really try fried fish cake !!" u'Great thai food in the area! There were two thai places around here and they were both a while wait. However my friends wanted to try out this place so we settled for this one. The food were really good. Although the wait about an hour... the waitress works really quick. The restaurant is super small and we had a party of six; hence we had to wait a while for a table. If you have a party from 2-4 it should be quicker. We waited from 7:30-8ish before we got seated. We were eating until around 9-10pm and there were still people waiting to be seated. Shows how good this place is ;) We ordered quite a lot of food. It was about just right for all six of us. We ordered curry puff chicken larb and go chai as appetizers. For entr\xe9e we had the red snapper with mango salad soft shell crab with garlic sauce pad see ew yellow curry with pinapple and beef (i forgot the name of this dish) and tom yum soup. I might have forgotten a dish.. but this was basically it. All the food was really good besides the pad see ew. The pad see ew tasted like it was burnt to me... I thought it was just me so I asked my friends and they said the same thing. The noodles were not too oily so that was a good thing. My favorite dish of the night would be the red snapper. It was soooooooooo delicious. The next time I come back I am definitely going to get that again. Red snapper is a MUST TRYY!! The go chai was good as well but just a bit too oily. It is filled with chives and the dipping sauce is yummmm! Chicken larb is basically minced chicken meat and I really liked it because it is not extremely flavorful or tasteless. It is right in the middle; perfect :) Overall great experience and I will come back with my other friends if every one is down for thai food!' u"Good place to grab dinner! We were quoted a 40 minute wait at another restaurant in the area - which I found to be incredulous at 6PM on a Friday - come on that's EARLY. But luckily we grabbed the last 2 seats in the place for a little bit. This place is teeny tiny but the food came out pretty quickly. I ordered my usual dish that I get at all Thai restaurants (pad kee mao) and it was different from some of the other places I've tried and I really liked it. I would definitely come back in the future!" u"Came here with friends who were visiting NYC for the weekend.Based on the other reviews it's obvious the portions are small but my friends and I were still surprised as to how small they were. Whatever we started to eat. \xa0But when the table next to us was served their order of pad Thai twice the size of ours and another table was served a bowl of green curry that also clearly had more than ours we got annoyed.The food is average and there are so many other Thai places in the area that you shouldn't waste your time or money on an establishment that takes advantage of tourists." u'There\'s a ton of Thai in this area. I went here on a whim in between double work shifts. It\'s a tiny restaurant with only 8 tables (2 4 tops the rest 2 tops). It\'s BYOB. The staff didn\'t mind that I came alone and didn\'t rush me. The thai iced tea was nice and strong. The curry puffs were solid but it\'s hard to mess up a curry puff. The red curry was okay but not amazing not very spicy and very reliant on bamboo shoots. The curry comes in a plate rather than a bowl I prefer a bowl for sure. I ordered during the lunch special time period but didn\'t get the free spring roll or whatever my bad for forgetting to ask I guess. The staff was eating around the same time but not food you could buy there much to the disappointment of some other patrons who came in afterwards. I eat a lot of Thai so this place was just "meh" for me if in the area again I\'d check out a different Thai spot.' u'Amazing pad Thai and red snapper. Friendly ladies working at the restaurant too. Seriously get the pad Thai. The veggie curry with avocado was also good' u"A friend and I came here for lunch during the weekday. The place is really small maybe only about 8-10 tables. So it seems like one of those hit or miss places - if you come at the right time you'll be seated immediately (like we were) but if you don't you might have to wait a while.I went with the lunch special which was a select entree with two spring rolls. The spring rolls were not good. At all. It is a good deal but if the spring rolls were your main selling point you might want to rethink that. I'm not even sure what it was filled with but the filling tasted like old mushy veggies. The sauce they topped it with was way too sour.I was hoping that the entree would be their saving grace but unfortunately it was not. I ordered the Pad Thai. It was too sweet - it tasted like they added a boatload of sugar to it. So I'm a bit confused as to where all these great ratings come from. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish? I don't know....but there are plenty of other Thai places I need to try before I give this one a second chance." u'Thai places are a dime a dozen - though always an excellent choice when needing a filling/warm meal. Extremely small place that can fit about 12ish diners total. Luckily a spot opened up as soon as we walked in.No lunch special on the weekend so settled on getting the Go Chai ($6) appetizer and Key Mao Ta Lay ($11.50). Go chai was three heavily fried chive pancakes served with a sweetish sauce. A little oily with an interesting filling that went well with some other chili paste provided. The Key Mao is sauteed and served with a variety of seafood (shrimp squid scallops) and the always tasty flat noodle. Extremely filling and flavored just right.Service is fast and the food here is comforting. Wish they had the lunch special all weekend to take advantage of them free spring rolls.' u'Hands down one of the best Thai places I\'ve been to in NYC - my other favorite is lan larb (there was one near me when I lived in midtown east) go try both these places if you have the time!This came highly recommended by a friend\'s coworker so we trekked all the way west today to try it out. It\'s a super small restaurant (maybe 15 seats?) so try going during the off-hours. Also since it\'s summer they open all the doors/windows so it can get pretty hot in there!!!We proceeded to order some stuff off their regular menu and of course off their "secret" menu that everyone talks about. It\'s just a separate standing menu that\'s already placed on the table. Pad Kra Pow - simple but amazing...my friend actually proclaimed that it was the best pad kra pow he\'s ever had. Since the lunch special was sliced pork we paid an extra $3.50 to make it ground pork - and added $2 I think for a fried egg on top. Both additions were totally worth it...everything was perfectly made down to the piping hot gooey egg yolk!String Beans with Crispy Pork - this was the item that was off the secret menu. SO. GOOD. Definitely was my favorite; the crispy pork was to die for...this was like a better version of Chinese sweet and sour pork. Smaller pieces and much crispier!!! Goes super well with rice!Country Style Curry - I thought this was the dish with the least amount of wow-factor but it was still good. It really isn\'t a curry...more like a light curry-flavored sauce over vegetables and chicken. Before we ordered it the waitress even warned us that this was "thai-spicy." We actually thought this was the perfect amount of spice so if you like spicy food this is the way to go. All 3 dishes came with 2 spring rolls which were also fresh and deep fried to perfection :).We\'re thinking about going again tomorrow...that sure says a lot eh?' u"Surely will satisfy that Thai craving such a cute little place and it being byob makes it that much more charming!Stopped in with a friend that lives around the corner and it was delish!We had the Thai spring rolls vegetable dumping which have peanuts in them (so good) chicken friend rice and a couple noodle dishes!Definitely a solid Thai choice while in the area and it won't break the bank!" u'I love coming here. The hostess is always friendly and accommodating. The staff is very nice.This is the only Thai restaurant that I go in Manhattan area.Their food is appetizing. My favorite is broccoli wrap with peanutlimedried pork. You have to order Thai style or the americanized dish will be a little bit too runny.Other dish that I order a lot is fried red snapper with mango sauce. Always on point and spicy.(Mild spicy is good medium spicy is too much for me)And love both thai iced tea and thai iced coffee.When in season mango with sticky rice is great dessert.' u"Extremely disappointed. We have been coming to Wondee Siam for the last 10 years. \xa0And we also order delivery from time to time. \xa0Tonight we ordered takeout and the tom yum soup noodle was so greasy it was not edible. \xa0 When we called and explained they were adamant that their tom yum soup is not greasy. \xa0 The photos show otherwise. \xa0Why can't they just be polite and admit that they mess up?" u"This restaurant is highly recommended by my coworker who is from Thai. We tried them today in our office party and the food are superb!!! The ingredients are very fresh and the dishes are very flavorful since some of my coworkers don't eat spicy so we asked them to make the dish not spicy but I definitely would like to go back to the restaurant next time to try these dishes again in normal spicy level. I really like drunken noodle the one we had with seafood is really delicious they put so many seafoods in there and the noodle is not greasy at all love it!Our coworkers can't stop but raving about the mango coconut rice if you want try their desert this is something you must try!" u"Had fantastic Pad Thai here - both the chicken and shrimp variants are tasty and well-portioned. I also recommend the fish cakes served with a delicious sweet and spicy chili sauce.As far as service goes (which doesn't influence my dining experience much) we were seated in 20 minutes on a Friday night - not bad! It's a bit cramped inside and you'll be intimately seated next to other diners but I personally didn't mind.Will definitely be coming back for more!" u"****WONDERFUL SMALL THAI RESTAURANT IN HK****As pretty much everyone notes this place is TINY; it's not meant to accommodate groups over 4. The interior is nice with weaving wooden panels on one wall and increasingly weaving chandeliers but it isn't going for a chic vibe like a lot of its HK Thai peers. There's no separate customer bathroom so if you need to go staff will happily point you along the path through the narrow kitchen closely skirting the back of chefs cooking huge pans on open flames. I'd actually recommend it for the experience...maybe not super buzzed though...we didn't bring anything but the place was BYOB and at least half of the tables were enjoying wine. The waitress was extremely kind and attentive although the food took a while to arrive. For what its worth there were some Thai people dining there which isn't often the case at other places.FOODThe papaya salad was terrific...the papaya was drenched in a wonderful sauce that combined both spice and sweetness. I'd totally recommend sharing this among the table.Chicken kra pow was delicious and done very well. Portion could have been a little bigger but the chicken was very savory and all the vegetables fresh and for $11.50 in Manhattan I can't cmoplaiChicken curry noodle soup -- I tasted some and it was very good the broth was very thick with a rich but not overwhelming taste.FINAL VERDICT: A great affordable choice among the abundance of Thai eateries in HK." u'Yum! Had the Panang chicken curry it had just the right amount of spice. Came with white sticky rice; hubby had chicken pad Thai. Kept our water filled but I wish it would have been icy.']
32.Room Service,[u"I first tried Room Service while looking through Grubhub for the highest rated Thai food around my apartment. I decided to order the Red Curry with white rice. They delivered it way faster than their time prediction and the food was hot and delicious! I decided to pay my favorite take out restaurant in NYC a visit with a friend . The decor inside is very trendy and chic I loved the chandeliers! \xa0However The customer service did not match the ambience especially our waiters who were very nonchalant. The food did come quite quickly though and it was delicious as always. Overall Room service never disappoints whether it's for takeout or dining in! I will definitely visit this restaurant on future trips/ extended stays in the Big Apple!" u"Arguably the best value for your money in midtown for Thai food. Great overall decor in the restaurant - it really makes you feel like you're in a modern trendy place. As far as the food goes they have a great lunch special for about $10 which comes with an appetizer and an entr\xe9e. I've done both sit down and to go with this place and would definitely recommend eating there. Not only is the decor worth it but the food tastes significantly worse when delivered.I've had the Pad Thai Spicy Basil Noodles and the Spicy Veggie Brown Fried Rice and loved them all - highly recommend!" u"I love this Thai restaurant for a dish I normally dislike! Pineapple fried rice. It is SO good!! I don't love rice but there is a ton of pineapple and cashews and raisins. The combination is awesome. The sesame tofu is a must. It's super crunchy with the sesame coating without being fried.Prices are SO good too. Lunch specials are $7 for a meal and appetizer and dinner isn't much more. I also love the decor. Minus one star for how loud it can get and sometimes you have to flag down waiters to get water." u"5 stars JUST FOR THEIR BRUNCH MENU ... It's at least $9 at most $11 for a delicious meal 11:30A-3:330P.I believe I've visited 4 times: Green and Red Curry both great. 5*Pineapple fried rice with chicken and Pineapple fried rice with shrimp and they're both delicious! 5*Takeout service is just as great. Dine in service is super (however today at a slow LUNCH my waiter kind of forgot about us with our check BUT I hunted someone down and paid. ITS WORTH IT HERE ... come for dinner or come for lunch then go out on the town. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. So far... My favorite Thai Restaurant." u"It's too bad Yelp doesn't allow ZERO stars.Ordered delivery for lunch. \xa0Food was good enough but1. \xa0Took 2 hours to get here2. \xa0Delivery guy calls that he's downstairs I go downstairs and he is NOWHERE to be found.I look in the lobby. \xa0Go outside. \xa0Go around corner. \xa0NOWHERE3. \xa0Charged $3 for deliveryI'm sorry but when you take 2 hours to deliver us food AND charge $3 fee AND nowhere to be seen when you call and say you are there I cannot tip you.It may not be the right thing to do and it may be a d!ck move but I can't.I will never order from this place again.Thank you." u"Our fav Thai place in the cityWe can live on those spicy basil noodles And the decor is stunningThe only reason I wouldn't give them a 5 is because of their service It's called room service but it takes hours for them to ask you what you would like and your standard dish doesn't come with a spoon so be prepared to ask a waiter for a spoon to serve your food with Aside from that great foodReally hits the spot!" u'Terrible service! Fantastic food and cocktails! I always struggle with how to rate restaurants that fall into this interesting category of bad service but good food. Had to ask 3 times at the bar for a glass of water and only after ordering the lychee mojito did the bar tender serve me a glass of water. Not sure if there were language barrier issues or what the deal was because then once seated it felt as if we had been neglected for 15 or so minutes before we were able to order any food. We were seated smack next to the chandelier which was super cool and helps add to the vibe. The lychee mojito was exactly what I needed after a long day out in the sun it was fruity and refreshing. The fried calamari was also phenomenal - by far the highlight of the meal. If you go definitely order the fried calamari appetizer. My chicken fried rice was decent but nothing amazing. Prices were very reasonable for the food but standard prices for the alcohol.' u'Based on the name and the decor I\'m surprised at how reasonable the prices are. The restaurant really is beautiful but I was hesitant to eat here because "Room Service" doesn\'t exactly sound like authentic Thai.The drinks here are amazing and not very pricey compared to other places in the area. I got the Tom Yum soup for an appetizer and it was really really good.The red curry that I ordered for dinner though was pretty bland which is kinda hard to do with red curry. It just didn\'t taste like much and didn\'t have much spice.I would go back and give them another try. Maybe it was an off day for the curry. 2 of the 3 girls I was with really liked their meal the other said that the Pad Thai had way way too much peanut in it like she was eating a jar of peanut butter. I guess now we know that next time we have to ask specifically for the curry to be spicy and for the Pad Thai to not have an excessive amount of peanut.' u"I've been coming here for years as they serve one of my favorite dishes in the city: peanut sauce rice with big shrimp satay.Ordered one today for pickup. Walked 10mins to pick it up walked back work opened order the rice had chicken instead of shrimp.I called to let them know. Was told I would have to pay extra for shrimp. I refused as this was their mistake. After arguing with me (I was quite kind and calm) I was put on hold to speak to manager. Manager told me I had to pay extra. I told manager that this was their mistake and they should take the loss as any good business knows to do. He continued to ARGUE with me so I hung up.Since I cannot eat chicken I am sitting here pissed picking chicken out of my food.There goes one of my favorite restaurants. Their customer service has never been good now I see how truly bad it is." u"***Delivery review only***So many Thai places to choose from in this area but since I like trying new spots decided to give Room Service a shot. Despite the odd name your basic Thai food choices are here.Decided on the Honey Glazed Short Ribs ($7) and the Chicken Pad See Euw ($10). Delivery time was around 30ish minutes and the food was still warm by the time I got it. Honey glazed ribs were chopped up into smaller pieces to fit the container I suppose - heavy on the sauce and sweetness thought it would have a better kick but the meat is cooked well. Pad see euw is your regular fare mixed chicken egg flat noodles and veggies. Rich and oily that puts you into a food coma fast.Overall nothing spectacular here. I feel like the lunch special is the way to go since it's much cheaper." u"Really fancy ambience but affordable Thai food. Wasn't as great tasting as it was hyped up to be... We went for Thai restaurant week and got the 21$ prix fixe deal. Good portions for a good price. We also got a free dish towel. Staff is nice" u'Do yourself a favor and do not order from Room Service. The Seamless delivery took over 2 hours (ordered at 12:09pm arrived at 2:15pm) during lunch time. I called the restaurant 4 times and every time the man on the phone put me on hold for 5+ minutes and then gave me an answer ("The delivery man left 20 minutes ago...he should be there shortly!") that proved to be a lie. When the food FINALLY came it was obviously not warm at all. I also specified "No peanuts" and "Steam tofu not fried" but of course they ignored all those. Luckily I don\'t have a peanut allergy (I just don\'t like peanuts) but this is deadly for those with a peanut allergy. I have nothing else to say about this place other than to AVOID!' u'For a place with the word "SERVICE" in its name the service was poor today. After a few subsequent visits since my original review its time that I downgrade This places rating. Our server tonight sucks at her job. This became apparent shortly after my party was seated when my friend asked for a Beer recommendation. Her lack of interest or ineptitude to make a recommendation was evident when he was trying to decide what to drink and she had no information to offer to assist him. It was like she was annoyed that we even asked for her opinion. As a server if your trying to make money you should be prepared to recommend something. This will only make the bill higher which should inflate your tip. In addition to her lack of helpfulness when I gave her cash to pay my check she did not bring my change back. She assumptively decided to keep my change for her tip. I typically tip 20 percent but the change amounted to about 10 percent and I let her keep that with out making an issue but she would have gotten more if she returned with my change. The one food item I ordered was an appetizer with assorted fried items. A couple of these fried items were cold like they were barely thawed after they took them out of the freezer to fry them. Cold food is never acceptable. Usually I would make an issue with management about each and every transgression I mentioned in this review but I was enjoying good company and conversation and decided not ruin the mood. But after tonight\'s lackluster service and substandard food they lost my patronage. It\'s a cool spot but in the restaurant business you have to be on point every time. Tonight they were not.' u"Best Thai place in NYC. Literally no competition with this place. The service is always good the food is always amazing. It's always packed through lunch & dinner so that should tell you how great this place is. In the past I've had the pineapple fried rice pad Thai spring rolls and dumplings. Everything is so good I feel like this place can do no wrong! Amazing flavors and good portion sizes." u"Before I came here I was not a big fan of Thai food. I thought it is too sweet for me and always contains much sauce. But this place totally changed my mind! (Thanks to my friend who booked this place for that dinner!)We came in as a group of 3. I walked in at around 6:30pm on a weekday evening and got seated immediately. We ordered 1 salad and 3 main courses - green apple & beef salad traditional Bangkok fried noodles wrapped by a layer of egg jumbo shrimp in clay pot and lychee duck. All of them tasted yummy! I wasn't super hungry that day so I assume they really offered good food not just I had good appetite. LOL.One note left: if you plan to bring some cakes here to share you will need to pay $1.5 fee to the restaurant. Just keep this in mind if you want to share a birthday cake here. If you have a large party come in that could be some amount of extra charges." u"Really great Thai food in NYC. My friend told us about it when we were visiting New York. I'm a huge fan of chicken pad Thai and they did not disappoint. Full of flavor! When I visit again I'll definitely be making a stop here :)" u'Nice Thai place. I had the Room Service Pad Thai which is wrapped in a thin egg crepe - great way to put a spin on the old recipe! Also enjoyed the coconut calamari and Thai Salad which had a nice spicy kick. The service was also very accommodating. Worth leaving your room to get Room Service.' u'Amazing place!! I was craving for Thai and we found this amazing place. Nice ambience very cheap but very good service. And food was delicious! Will go back there again and again' u"It was the 4 of us on a Friday night around 9:30 and the wait was about 20 minutes. My friends got drunken man noodles with chicken and shrimp.. Asked for spicy and it came out really tasty. Wish it was a little more spicer though. I ordered mango lemongrass chicken and it wasnt cooked right where the chicken was kinda hard. Wasnt juicy at all and was VERY SWEET.. Then we got a dessert something with chocolate with greentea ice cream. Chocolate thing was NOT good AT ALL. I cant even remember the name at this point because i couldn't careless for it but the ice cream was yummy!" u'This place is disgusting. I got Roadside Noodles to go and discovered a RUBBER GLOVE in the bottom of the takeout container. I will NEVER go here again and urge you to do the same.']
23.OBAO,[u'Excellent food and an amazing lunch deal.Went for dinner during restaurant week. The pho broth was so delicious flavorful fragrant and unique. The sea bass melted in your mouth and the bahn mi (while small) was fantastic as well not so crispy that it cuts the roof of your mouth. Though the bread is a bit on the thick size. Also the rib appetizer while tasty is definitely overpriced and not really substantial. But aside from that the food quality was excellent!As for the lunch deal wow for about $10 you get an entree and an appetizer. Totally worth it and totally delicious!' u"Went to Obao on a Monday night and got the restaurant week special along with a couple appetizers and entr\xe9es for 3 people. We were seated at the bar for which there was no wait - they were surprisingly at 9pm on Monday! Everything we ordered had good flavor but some of the appetizers I felt were overpriced for the amount of food (the BBQ spare ribs in particular). The Pho is really good as was the fish and pork belly bahn mi (though the bahn mi was a little small).The service was pretty good with the exception that they didn't bring out all the ingredients for one of the appetizers and it took a couple of tries for them to make it right.Finally the lunch special deal is amazing - we ordered delivery a few days later." u"Good place. I must say that I am comparing it to Vietnamese food in New Orleans which I appreciate so much more now. Also I will admit that I did not follow the Yelp recommendations on what to order. That being said...I ordered a vermicelli bowl with chicken on top. I asked if I could get one egg roll on the side or on top of the bowl (a regular option in New Orleans) and was told this is not possible and that I could order a set of 7 spring rolls. I did not do this. \xa0The crisp of the egg roll is such a good topping! If I was with someone else I would have ordered it. The bowl is huge when it comes to the table. Unfortunately it was primarily lettuce and greens with minimal vermicelli. \xa0The chicken was certainly tasty and a good amount of it was there but the vermicelli noodles were not enough so that's why I gave a lower rating in addition to it not being very flavorful. It was certainly decent but not 5-stars for me. I would give this place a chance again this time following Yelp reviews' recommendations. The service was ON POINT I must say because I was sooo thirsty and my water was filled regularly and that is sooo great." u'Where do I begin Obao?! You are everything a foodie could want and more. If I had to marry a restaurant Obao would be it. I\'ve been here two times and both times; it has never failed to disappoint. FOOD: First off if you go from 12 PM - 4 PM on any day weekends include you can take advantage of their lunch special. $9 for a selection of entrees with a choice of various appetizers. Where in New York City especially in Hell\'s Kitchen are you going to find such great food for such a low price? I was so impressed. I got the Tom Yum Soup and Bahn Mi Pork Belly and it was some of the greatest Vietnamese food I have ever had. The other time I had their Cashew Chili Chicken which was also amazing. The food here is a modern take on classic Vietnamese and they do it well.DRINKS: There is a selection of beer and fancy cocktail drinks. Come during happy hour for specials! AMBIANCE: The ambiance is the best part of this place. There\'s a weird way that Obao makes you feel. Its perfectly quaint and "hipster" with twinkling lights and lanterns. But at the same time you never feel like you are out of place. It\'s like being at a hipster coffee shop and feeling like you belong - you\'ll have to go and check out the ambiance yourself. SERVICE: My water was refilled every time I took a sip. There service was great. The servers were so courteous and nice. OVERALL: I love you Obao.' u'Very good food ambience and service. Would definitely recommend. I had the steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings as an appetizer and it was very delicious the sauce was amazing. I ordered the pad see iew and the flavor was very good but I thought the noodles were a bit too long/thick a bit greasy as well. My 2 friends both ordered the Pho Bo and it was delicious the beef was thinly sliced and served rare the way I like it!' u"Very impressed by this place. Did the $9 lunch special that everyone raved about in the reviews and it was incredible. Everyone at my table got something different for the app I thought the dumplings were by far the best. You get two of them. I got the beef pho off the lunch special. It was a large portion and very tasty. My only complaint was that they didn't bring the typical pho sauces to the table which I love throwing in to make it spicy or even more flavorful. The drinks were awesome. I got the Flunk Flink and it was awesome. If you like lychees you need this drink in your life. Service was great too. Our waters were never empty and even though they were packed we placed our order quickly. Would highly recommend." u'Second Visit to this was a complete bust.My soup was hot water with over cooked chicken. the staff was not interested in serving their costumers.Left the resturant after a few bites.Ironically this resturant served me the best pho I had in nyc a few weeks back' u'I REALLY wanted to like this place. I was so excited because they had Michelin rated dishes. Meh. Okay first off I met my friend there. She sat at the bar & had a drink because they wouldn\'t seat her until I got there. Fine. I got there and we were seated but they wouldn\'t let us order until my friend closed out her bar tab and opened up a table tab......They also could not split our bill without us telling them exactly how much on each card. They just made everything difficult which I was not expecting for a "nicer" restaurant.The food was not very impressive either. Which is where my rating mainly comes from. (since food matter most :P...)1) The sugar cane rib skewers were actually REALLY good. I loved them. I would get them again.2) Tasted the pad thai and it was okay...kind of saucy and they used thin noodles instead of the usual "pad thai" noodles. 3) I ordered B\'un with chicken (Michelin rated). The waitress told me it wasn\'t spicy (I can\'t eat spicy foods). I was expecting a noodle dish with chicken and a sauce some veggies and a ton of flavor. I was very disappointed. My dish LOOKED full and amazing. From the bottom there was a sauce (which was kind of spicy)...like a soup. Then a TON of shredded lettuce. Then about 1/4 cup of vermicelli noddles. and a lot of chicken. I hardly tasted any peanuts or scallions. I had to spit out more than one bite because this lettuce was bruised wilted and sour. It just wasn\'t a good experience.I was really excited to tr this place out but I definitely would not go back. 2 stars for the appetizer.' u"It was ok interesting menu. I would go back to try different things. We had papaya salad which I love but this needed more heat wasn't spicy to me. Steamed dumplings... I'll pass \xa0sugar cane with meat wrapped was o.kneeds more meat. Food was just okThank you for responding. I will be back to try other thinks on the menu looking forward to try your Pho! I found you through Open Table. Pro is that you guys are open late enough to grab food after a Bway show!" u"I came to Obao on Wednesday evening with my girlfriend and four others. The restaurant is not particularly large but it was able to accommodate a table of 6 in the upstairs seating. The space was pretty dark and it felt almost like being in a pub.I'm rating it 4 stars but if I could give 3.5 I probably would. The food was pretty good but the service was really lacking. We were seated in the corner of the room and were basically forgotten for most of the evening. Our water was refilled twice -- once during the meal and another right before we left.I ordered the roasted duck noodles and I would recommend it. At $14 the portion is on the smaller side and I was only really able to feel full after finishing a quarter of my girlfriend's dish (which she was too full to eat). Despite the smaller portion the flat noodles were tasty and there were good chunks of duck. It also came with a delicious hot sauce which had a nice balance of light heat and sweet flavor.Still at $14 I would be open to trying new restaurants especially having so many around in the theater district." u'OBAONY Manhattan Hells Kitchen Restaurant Row7:30pm Friday 3rd June 2016Four StarsI have passed by this place dozens of times and I always thought about stopping in. However I had no idea it was an "It" place to be. The facade is two stories of windows with openable door to let a nice breeze in. The long black granite bar top takes up most of the front of the restaurant and seats about 15 people. There are a lot of filament lights that sets a beautiful atmosphere. The wood and black steel rounds out the ambiance. We had a reservation for 9 and were seated almost immediately in the back. The cocktail list was pretty interesting. I wanted the smoke signal but it was unavailable because the smoke mahjong was broken. I had a $13 Makers Mark which came in a heavy rocks glass and Spherical-ish shaped ice. If you follow them on Instagram obao_Ny you get a free edamame. We ordered a bunch of food and shared it. The papaya salad was refreshing citrusy with a hint of spice. The basil fried rice had thick succulent shrimp and a delicious mix of onions scallions egg and bell peppers. The Pad See Ew had thick fresh rice noodles with brown sauce and Chinese broccoli. The short ribs were salty fatty and plentiful. The lobster Pad Thai ($35) had a whole crustacean. The claws and tail were expertly extracted and delicious. The glass noodles had a good flavor but overall only were too sweet and not enough salt and spice. I really enjoyed the food. It was reasonably priced. \xa0The service was okay. Overall it was a good meal.' u"Fantastic atmosphere- lanterns hanging from the ceiling firewood on the walls good mood lighting. AND THE FOOD! My friends and I ordered many appetizers and there was not one thing we didn't like. I think my favorite was the Pad Kee Mao. Recommend you try it." u"Pretty good pho place in NY.Order their Pho Bo & Pho Ga (Beef & Chicken Pho) and it was good. The broth was clean tasting which I liked. The decor of the place was nice. Very modern and chic. Loved their lighting. The service was good too. But pho was kinda expensive and the quanity on the small side. But it definitely hit the spot after a night of drinking. I can see myself coming back here if I'm ever in NY again!" u"We waited for a while before we were seated. \xa0Our full party wasn't here yet. \xa0The restaurant is pretty loud and we were seated next to this group where one of the guys went a little too crazy thanks to Mr. Alcohol...What we ordered:-Kimchi fries - we didn't know what to expect-Pad Kee Mao with beef - extra charge for the beef-Pad thai with beef - no extra charge for the beef-a noodle soup that I completely forgot the name of!!....This place was packed! The service wasn't bad since they were pretty busy. \xa0The food was good! \xa0The pad kee mao had lots of going on with the flavor and it was a good kick. \xa0However the pad thai seemed a bit mediocre.. My friend asked for it to be made spicy but she ended up asking for more hot sauce. \xa0The kimchi fries turned out to be fries topped with kimchi and some type of sauce. \xa0It was a good combo.Out of all four of these dishes the noodle soup seemed to be the star! \xa0I'm so sad that I forgot the name of it. \xa0I'm definitely planning on coming back to find out the name and to try more of their food." u"Solid. Takes reservations. A little loud but cute space inside. Start with the shrimp rolls in the glass noodlely wrappy thingies. Other mentionables include: fried rice noodles basil chicken cashew chicken... But you should really try the noodles here. The pad Thai lobster looked really good so I'd sample it the next time I come back. Overall good service consistently good food and a nice selection to choose from." u"Let me start off by saying this is not your average Vietnamese restaurant. This place be fancy. You walk in and you are captured by their shiny/sleek decor. My friend and I were confused that we had walked into the wrong restaurant and had to take a few steps back to double check the sign at the door.I ordered from their lunch special - a set price for one appetizer and entree. I ordered their dumplings and a regular pho bowl. I was impressed by their fast service but not so much the quality of their food. If you are looking for authentic Asian food this is not the place to go. The food tasted very American and it was a huge disappointment for me... :( but this would all depend on one's preference. Conveniently located near Port Authority and good customer service." u'Convenient location in the theatre district The food was great as well as the service. Very friendly vibe I would definitely come back. I had the Pad Thai and Thai Tea- the decor is cozy has cool lights all over the ceiling.' u"I came here for my friends' birthdays and I had a wonderful experience! I definitely will want to come back and try out their lunch specials!Appetizers: Calamari was delicious and full of flavor. Also I got to try the spare ribs on sugarcane skewers. It was a first time for me and I thought it was really tasty even though it would be nice to have a little bit more meat on the sugarcane. Entrees: I got the Pad Thai Shrimp and I would definitely recommend it. They gave a lot of shrimp in my dish and the noodles were different than the usual pad Thai noodles! It's different than the regular pad Thai that I eat but I thought it was very flavorful and would definitely order it again. I would recommend you to order it if you want to try a different spin to Pad Thai. My friends got the red curry duck and they all said positive things about their dish. All my friends were extremely full after their meals as well. Interior: the first floor has a dim but classy vibe. It was very warm and welcoming. The second floor if seated by the Windows there is very good lighting and view! For birthdays: they do charge a $3 cake fee per person if you want to bring your own cake. However they do sing happy birthday and cut the cake for you. The servers were very accommodating to both our tables with serving the cake and singing happy birthday twice since we were seated at two different tables!" u"Would recommend swinging by if you're in the mood for Thai but if not try somewhere else.Good sized menu with a variety of dishes to choose from. Portions are a tad small but for the area I think that's pretty common. Prices are reasonable as well (most ranging between $11 - $17). The restaurant was decently sized. There was upper and lower level seating. Both seating areas weren't particularly big so be aware if you're trying to come in with a larger group! My friends and I waited about 30 minutes for a group of 5 people. Not horrible but it was also a Wednesday night.I ordered the pad see iew which was pretty good. The noodles were soft and silky with just the right amount of soy sauce for flavor. Veggies and meat were both in good amounts too.Now onto service. Our waitress wasn't attentive. There were times we needed additional utensils refills on water etc and no one was passing by. It was hard to flag someone down since we were in the corner. We also had an issue when it came to our bill since instructions on bill splitting weren't clearly communicated from our waitress which was quite annoying." u'Came here as a party of 4 and will certainly be back so that my boyfriend can try it as well!Location/Accessibility : \xa0Easy to find on the street and close to the ACE. \xa0Slightly closer to 42nd St than 50th but both would do just fine. \xa0Ambience : I loved this place. \xa0The bar area is close to and open to the street side. \xa0It brightened up the restaurant and made the space seem more open. \xa0As you go further into the restaurant you\'ll find the main seating area. \xa0While there was plenty of seating I definitely didn\'t feel squished next to any strangers and didn\'t have any random butts in my face from shuffling around. \xa0They utilized their \xa0 space well. \xa0I really liked the decor. \xa0I wasn\'t able to get a good photo of it but they had these orange light fixtures that from afar reminded me of "lanterns" in the shape of hot air balloons. \xa0The lighting was dim but not so much that I ever felt like it was dark; it was nice and soft for a relaxing dinner. \xa0They also use mirrors which always helps to make a space look a little larger. \xa0The bar and the tables were the type of wood that seemed a bit rustic but very homey. \xa0By the time we were finished with dinner the restaurant was packed but never did I feel like I had to yell to be heard or that I couldn\'t hear someone speaking. \xa0If I could pick one word to describe how it felt being there I would say : pleasant.Service : The bar tender was very prompt upon me sitting at the bar. \xa0She made sure to ask if I had any questions about the drink menu. \xa0The drink came out very quickly. \xa0The only tiff I have is that she put two drinks on the same tab when I fully intended to pay for my own. \xa0The hostess was very kind upon seating our party of 4.The server acknowledged our table right away. \xa0This is something that people take for granted I think. \xa0I\'ve been to places where I was sitting for 15 minutes if not more before anyone came to the table. \xa0In any case we were all pretty quick to figure out what we wanted and likewise the food was INCREDIBLY quick to come out. \xa0Another thing people may take for granted : clearing of the table. \xa0Not that I need to be waited on hand and foot but I appreciate that it shows how attentive they are and at what standard they hold their service at. \xa0Bussers (I assume?) were very polite upon asking if they could take dishes away and were very timely. \xa0It\'s as if they knew the exact moment to come in. \xa0When we asked for the check it came and was turned around really quickly. \xa0I suppose I keep mentioning how fast the service was. \xa0While this is certainly a plus I don\'t want to take away from the fact that their service was also quality! Food and Drink : I got a drink just to get one but I\'m actually glad that I did. Thai Sabai - This one is SWEET! Just how I like it. \xa0Minimal taste of alcohol. Very enjoyable nice and cute. \xa0I originally looked at the menu online and wanted to order Pad Thai. \xa0However the restaurant menu has little Michelin symbols for those items that are Michelin Recommended. \xa0Did you know they did that? I didn\'t... In any case that changed up the game plan. \xa0I went with...Bu\'n with Saut\xe9ed Flank Steak - Absolutely delicious. \xa0I would eat this again for sure. \xa0The steak itself was SO good. \xa0My only "complaint" is that I wish there were more steak and less lettuce. \xa0Don\'t get me wrong. \xa0The lettuce added a great element to balance the dish out; it was fresh and crisp. \xa0I\'m just very much more of a meat eater than veggie eater. \xa0Plentiful amount of pineapple which I also love. \xa0The cucumber was less abundant but whenever you manage to snag some in a bite it was wonderfully refreshing. \xa0While for the most part I\'m really trying not to revisit places so as to branch out as much as possible I definitely want to return here so my boyfriend can try and experience OBAO. \xa0Thanks for a wonderful meal and can\'t wait to try more!']
18.Briciola,[u'The food here is AMAZING! However the seating arrangement is awkward and uncomfortable since everyone is basically sharing one communal table. The hostess is also unfriendly and very strict with the seating. I knew about the seating arrangements before I arrived but I didn\'t realize the extent of how tight the space was. I was literally touching elbows with the people next to me. \xa0AppetizersThe waiter verbally recited the specials for the day to me which were both items that I already planned to order:1) Octopus Salad ($15)- Delicious!!!!!! You NEED to order this! The flavors of the balsamic and pesto blends perfectly together. They give generous portions of the grilled octopus unlike other restaurants I\'ve been to. There were bigger chunks of grilled octopus in the dish than the amount of greens in the "salad". This is my kind of salad! 2) Burrata ($16) This dish consisted of a big ball of fresh mozzarella on top of a bed of prosciutto. This was a very enjoyable dish which I ate with the crunchy bread that they give you. Great dish to share although I felt like it was a lot of prosciutto for two people but if we had more people with us it would be a perfect appetizer. PastaThe portion of the pasta was quite small but perfect for us since we were a bit full from our appetizers already:1) Fettuccine Funghi ($12)- I would totally order this pasta again. It was creamy came with a lot of mushrooms and you can taste the delicious truffle oil and garlic in the sauce. The fettucine was perfectly cooked.2) Rigatoni Gamberi ($12)- I liked the spicy tomato sauce and grilled shrimp for this dish. However I felt that the pasta was a bit undercooked.The food is definitely worth coming here for if you can look past the extremely crammed space.' u"Came here on a night that was 92 degrees and humid.For some reason this place is reluctant to use their AC to its full extent - they not only left the door open but they also had 20+ tiny CANDLES as decor. CANDLES. IN 92 DEGREE WEATHER. Who decided that was a good idea?Only when multiple people who were already crammed into a space so tight and right next to 20 candles and a kitchen which - surprise surprise - uses heat to cook food complained the waitstaff made a grand gesture to close the doors. But remember the AC was barely on so it didn't help much with the kitchen action and being in a tiny space with 10+ people.Honesty I couldn't enjoy the food because we were fighting the heat for our lives and swatting mosquito away.I probably will not be returning in the summer." u"Awesome Italian food at a great price! Although seating might not be suitable for large groups as most guests were seated at the bar or the commuter table Briciola is a great spot to bring a date or a few friends. We had the special octopus salad ($15) which included delicious grilled octopus capers tomatoes and slice potatoes. This also came with some fresh toasted bread. We also ordered some blue point oysters as appetizer which were just $1 each (all day I believe). The food came out pretty quickly and it was always hot and fresh. I was pleased with the texture of the pasta as well as the portion. For $12 you can pick any pasta from their extensive list which included options with meat to mushrooms to seafood. The pastas were definitely some of the better ones I've had in the city.Overall we were really pleased with our experience at Briciola and would definitely recommend others to try it if they are in the area. I will definitely be back to try their other appetizers crostini and pastas!" u"Bricola is one of my favorite wine/tapas bars in the city! I discovered it from the recommendation of a coworker and I've been many times since. Unfortunately they don't take reservations and because it's such a tiny restaurant with one long communal table and very limited bar seating expect a long wait to be seated. I've been for dinner several times and it was about a 30 minute wait. More recently I came for a lunch on a Sunday at around 3pm and there was no wait at all. Below are the dishes I always get and highly recommend:1. \xa0$1 oysters during happy hour. It's all day until they run out on the weekends and during happy hour on weeknights.2. \xa0Grilled Octopus Salad. This is seriously amazing and I can't get enough! The octopus is so tender and flavored so well with balsamic vinegar pesto and olive oil and potatoes.3. Truffle Gnocchi Special. Not sure that they always have this but every time I've been I've gotten this. It's a little pricey at $23 but I mean truffles and gnocchi together makes it soo worth it.If you're with one other person this should be plenty of food and you will leave so satisfied! Don't forget to wash it all down with a bottle of white wine!Wish I could give this place 5 stars but with the inability to make reservations and the super cramped seating I think 4 stars is best." u"I would give this restaurant 5 stars if it had proper tables. It's just a long wooden table with stools. I also encountered a very rude bratty hostess. I can only assume it was someone's niece who was forced to come in and help out. Now on to the food. I went for the octopus salad while my friends went with the pasta. It wasn't a particularly large portion but it was just right. The oil they used to to flavor the octopus salad was delicious. Not sure if I'd return but it would be related to the lack of regular tables. It's best suited for wine tastings and events like that." u"We arrived around 10pm. The hostess told us it'd be a 10 minute wait. While we were waiting a man (perhaps the manager or the owner) blocked the entrance with the sandwich board. Ok? The hostess motioned for us to come in. We had to sidestep/hop around the sandwich board to enter the restaurant. The aforementioned man took our orders and promptly ignored us for the rest of the evening. A bus boy brought our bread appetizer and entrees. I wouldn't be so offended if I hadn't watched the man (who seemed to be the owner or manager) socializing heavily with the two groups next to us all the while completely ignoring us. I ordered the pesto risotto which sounded interesting as I'd never seen the two combined before. Although the dish was a strong shade of green I did not detect much pesto flavor. Still the risotto was fine. It was difficult for me to draw the attention of our supposed waiter (whom I suspect is the owner or manager) because he was so busy chatting with the people next to us. For the same reason it was also difficult for us to get our check. As we left we again had to sidestep/hop around the sandwich board which I think is ridiculous. Fine I get it you're closed but at least let people leave! Incredibly unprofessional and rude to allow customers to dance around a sandwich board to exit!" u"This was a great find for some real Italian pasta. Amazing food and intimate ambiance but maybe too tight of a squeeze to fully enjoy your dinner.I'd definitely recommend this place for happy hour. They have $1 oysters- huge blue point oysters when we went. Dinner was also delicious with $12 for a plate of pasta that tastes well worth it. I ordered the pesto dish and was very pleased with my choice. My friend ordered the gnocchi and parmesan special which was so rich and creamy with a nice truffle flavor. Just be careful to ask for the prices before ordering the specials because we didn't realize until the bill came that the gnocchi special was twice the cost of the regular pasta dishes. We also each got a glass of wine for $8 which the bar tenders will let you taste before ordering. Although the food was great the space was not. It was such a tight squeeze even for a NYC bar/restaurant. The only dining area has one table where they seat multiple parties. It's a cute family style seating but you will be in your neighbor's business for sure. The bar area was so narrow and packed that the waitress had trouble walking over with food or the bill to those sitting on the outer bar. Your best bet is to sit at the main bar that way you don't have to get up and the waitress can reach you more easily. Otherwise you may not get the best service since the waitresses tend to hang near the bar which provides the only open space for staff.I'd definitely come back for happy hour those oysters are well worth it!" u'A very small intimate restaurant. And when I say \'small\' I mean it\'s so small that you can almost stretch out both arms and reach each side of the walls. We got seated right away. Since it\'s such a small restaurant we had to share a rectangular shaped communal table. It has stools that can seat 8 people on each side. Shelves of wine bottles line both side of the walls. Our waiter was friendly you can tell he was a "real Italian" as he had a very thick Italian accent. I could barely understand him as he explained the Specials. Although he was very nice and always checked on us. I ordered the Fettuccine Funghi. It was delicious! The sauce the mushrooms the chunks of garlic & the aldent\xe8 pasta were all cooked to perfection. They also served complimentary bread which we had to ask for. It was very crusty and went well with Olive oil and balsamic vinegar. My boyfriend ordered the Linguine pasta with Clams white wine and garlic sauce. I had a taste of it and it too was just as delicious and full of flavor! Overall great restaurant & decent price! If you don\'t mind sharing a communal table are not claustrophobic and want delicious authentic Italian food then this place is for you! You won\'t be disappointed.' u"Supposedly they have the same owner as aria across the street. But they also have a $1 oyster every day of the week so i decided to come here. They dont seat until the whole party arrives and even then they designate where u sit and it's elbow to elbow with other parties without any wiggle room at all. Makes u wanna get outta there quick. But they do have a good selection of wine and tapas. We had a strip steak octopus and a pasta as well. Octopus is still the best. And if it was for pasta id go back to aria instead since they have the same menu. It's only a nice place if you like the change in ambiance." u"I love the sister restaurant down on Franklin street but I cannot get behind this place.1st of all - while there is AC in the back of the kitchen the temperature in the restaurant yesterday was like a sauna. \xa0If I were them I would run out and buy some fans at least. \xa0I couldn't even cross my legs yesterday as when I did sweat was dripping down my legs. \xa0A couple of smart people came in and left straight away cause they said they couldn't eat with the temperature so warmUnfortunately we had ordered a bottle so we finished the bottle in the sauna like temperature and then high tailed it out of there.Wait staff was RUDE. \xa0Asked for ice and got a look like I had 2 heads. \xa0One of the waitresses / servers / staff was drinking some coffee concoction by the door. \xa0Really? How many places allow the staff to be eating in the middle of the restaurant???And lastly at one point there were 4 of them all huddled in the back and we couldn't flag anyone to come over and get us the bill.While the pasta smelled amazing do yourself a favor and go downtown to Terra on Franklin street. \xa0This place is a smaller non AC rude version of their sister restaurant.I really hope management reads my review. \xa0There's a lot left to be desired here." u"There's a location across the street that's the actual restaurant part & has viable seating. \xa0Found this out when I came here for a date. \xa0I had lasagna which was delicious and it's tiny in here but my date was a lot of fun and we could hear each other have good conversation and all that. \xa0Service was attentive as well. \xa0I'd return ideally when it's less hot outside." u'What a nice little spot - and I emphasize little. \xa0It is tiny - maybe a dozen seats around the bar and a large community table in the other room. \xa0I was lucky that I was solo and could find a spot at the bar. \xa0They were full at 700 on a Wednesday. \xa0Great meal. \xa0Started with the Buratta special followed by Ceasar and paparadell. \xa0The ceasar was the weakest dish - little too heavy on the dressing which made the salad a bit soggy. \xa0Paparadell was perfect. \xa0If you can get in - worth it!' u"Hell's Kitchen is one of my new favorite in the city. It is full of cozy bars and delicate places and Briciola is a great example. Came here twice- first brought here by a girl and then I brought another friend here. This place is close to a majority of Broadway shows theatres near time square. So I would recommend it as a dinner place before shows. The menu is not much but absolutely enough for you to pick from. I know this place offers a variety kinds of spaghetti. Definitely order some if you are s fan. Seafood here is also nice. I tried squid mussel and lobster-all were yummy. This place is tiny but with a good size bar. So you should order some alcohol too of you are not in a rush. Service is so so-they are always busy and don't care customers much. But I'm ok with it which leaves me more privacy. In general I like this place and would come back." u"Briciola is a nice place to pop by in Hell's Kitchen area if you are looking for Italian but taking a look back I would consider other Italian places around Manhattan than here due to the limited space potential long waits and the push for you to leave. There were only two of us going there to sit at the communal table for dinner but this place is not good for parties at all. FOOD: I ordered the lobster ravioli and octupus salad with my friend. The ravioli was a bit overcooked for me not as al dente as I would have hoped. People here rave about the cheap prices (~$10 per entree) but honestly portion sizes are small! The octupus salad was the best though. Perfectly grilled and seasoned and not overcooked because we all know overcooked octupus tastes like rubber. SERVICE: This is where the three stars comes in. I was rushed to order but when we were ready to order we were promptly skipped. The wine did come quickly but the food was a little slow. At the end of the meal upon signing the check a not so gentle nudge to leave the communal table was given. I mean that's the New York City way no? I wish though the service was a bit better but with so many people in such a small space no wonder the service lacks. I would try this again if I was in the area again but squeezing in through the bar area sitting at a really tight communal table is not really my jam. I would look for another Italian place in this great city." u'WOW! This is a tiny little restaurant! Theres only one long table with stools so you sit at the same table as the rest of the customers. The food is ridiculously good! You think it cant get any better and then it does! I got the Fettuccini Funghi and was shocked at how good it was. The sauce is absolutely perfect. We got Tiramisu for desert which was perfection in every bite.' u"Cannot say enough good things about the ambiance and food here. This is a typical New York very narrow restaurant that has a long table and you're sitting shoulder to shoulder with the people next directly next to you. Super cute space with a great wine selection as well. I wouldn't recommend coming here with too many people since it's pretty tiny- we came with a group of 4 and luckily didn't have a ridiculous wait. The food is incredible - for $12/pasta I cannot say enough good things about it. My personal favorite is the tagliatelle with wild boar. The sauce is flavorful and the boar is delicious and goes so well with the pasta. I've also had the ravioli which is also incredible but you may need another dish with that. The lamp chop appetizer is fantastic as well. Overall I would try a bunch of things and share them with whoever you go with because nothing is disappointing. I'm moving out of NY soon and am bummed I won't get the same level of pasta anywhere else. Briciola is a hidden gem and I'd go back here weekly if I could to try every kind of pasta. Don't miss out on it!" u'Super small but intimate and cute place. Dollar oysters and reasonably priced smaller plates with a nice selection of wine by the glass. Great place to catch up with a friend. We ordered a dozen oysters the burrata special mussels (excellent broth) spaghetti vongole and the chocolate souffl\xe9. Add in two drinks each and the bill was a bit over a 100 bucks. Can get super tight in winter because you are hanging your stuff right under the bar by your chair and can feel a bit squeezed in. Would come back again when the weather is warmer.' u"I have been here a few times now and this is one of my favorite places to eat with their sister location Aria across the street and also in the West Village. The food is amazing. The burratta is so fresh and delicious definitely try it. Also have tried the octopus salad and skirt steak which are seasoned to perfection. The ambience is cool and friendly and the service is on point. Also they have dollar oysters for happy our and don't forget to enjoy the vermentino wine they serve here with a nice assortment of cheeses and meats." u"I simply cannot get over how cheap and delicious their menu is. If the restaurant itself wasn't so tiny it'd be 5 stars!Squeezing in thru the bar area into the dining room was struggle city. Once seated at the long communal table I could finally sit back and appreciate the rustic decor. It has a wine cellar vibe with dimly lit lights; its a cute romantic spot. You have to hang your coat up on the wall and pretty much hold onto your bags underneath the table (annoying) but the food was so good that I forgot all about my discomfort. We started with the Crostini di Pulpo which was just perfect. The octopus was so tender and it paired really well with the salsa verde. I'd like to say I enjoyed the crostini but it scraped the roof of my mouth (we all know that feel). We tried 4 pastas but I can only recall 2 of them: Tagliatelle Bolognese & Garganelli Osso Bucco. They were both yummy but the bolognese reallyyy blew us away... WOW. Pretty sure they were heavy handed with the heavy cream in that dish but I ain't complaining! My friend & I also split a bottle of cabernet so its safe to say that we walked out of there pleasantly full & buzzed. Service was pleasant no complaints.Will return again and again. See you soon Briciola!" u"Its a bit hard to accurately rate Briciola for me. I was actually torn between voting 3 stars or 4 stars. I would love to give this a 3 and a half stars if it were possible. I'll explain why below.I normally avoid Times Square like the plague because any native New Yorker knows that this area is just one big overpriced Disneyland for tourists who don't know any better. If you want authentic food you need to head to lower Manhattan the Lower East Side or Brooklyn. But I saw that Briciola was rated 4 stars and me naturally being a pasta fiend I had to check it out. The restaurant is a very tiny cramped space. There is literally just a narrow space for just one person to walk thro the aisle. The restaurant has two narrow strips that function as two continuous tables one by the bar in the front and the other strip in the back. It was a very busy night so I waited for about 25 minutes before one couple finished eating and the spot became available. I sat down promptly and began reading the menu as fast as I could so that I could order my food quickly. I saw from the plates of my neighboring patrons that the portion sizes here are small so I knew I had to order two pastas. I started first with the Gnocchi Sorrentina. Honestly I wasn't too impressed. The gnocchi was cooked just right but there was barely any sauce on the dish!! A great pasta dish should be bathing in sauce in my opinion. So what I did was I ordered a side of meatballs because I knew the meatballs would come with a generous helping of sauce. I used the sauce from the meatballs to supplement the skimpy amount of sauce on the gnocchi. For my second plate of pasta I actually looked to the guy sitting right next to me and asked him what he ordered because it both looked & smelled amazing. It was the Fettuccine ai Funghi. I ordered that as well and thankfully this dish was a winner. The fettuccine cooked al dente and this particular mushroom sauce was creamy and rich unlike at other restaurants which often create bland mediocre mushroom sauces. Now that I think about it I should have just ordered two Ai Funghis LOL. That would have pushed my rating all the way to a 4. I finished the night with 3 scoops of vanilla gelato drizzled with warm chocolate."]
116.Il Forno Hell’s Kitchen,[u"I ate here while on business in 2014. My colleague and I were aimlessly walking around looking for a place to eat that wouldn't cost us an arm and a leg in the Time Square area and were pleasantly surprised by a special they were offering. At the time the special included a personalized gourmet pizza dessert and a glass of wine for under $30. The service was great from the time we were greeted outside the restaurant to when we paid for our bill and finished off the last few bites of cheesecake. I will definitely return to Il Forno the next time I visit NYC. The atmosphere was great the staff were amazing and the food was fantastic." u"Food poisoning from the fish! Terrible \xa0un-authentic food that should be avoided like the plague. Service was neutral \xa0not polite but not rude. Waiter recommended an awful yet expansive entree that nobody enjoyed. The grilled salmon came out leathery and burnt as did the kale (not even sure how it's possible to burn kale but they somehow managed). Oh and the fish gave me food poisoning. The bolognese was a tiny portion and tasted tinned but at least it wasn't burnt. Our friend with the fish of the day said he'd give it 4/10. Poor drinks selection \xa0virtually no beer selection at all. Overall overpriced \xa0small portioned cheap quality meals served under the decor of a classy Italian restaurant. \xa0Don't be fooled. The water is even served in jam jars \xa0I mean \xa0really? The walls are nice though." u'This is a great Italian restaurant. The decor is beautiful. The walls have a very homey rustic Italian look. Very good prices. The Pizette is a delicious personal sized pizza on the cheaper side.Definitely recommend this place for a date.' u"I wanted to give a four star review but the food did not sit well with me (even though it tasted delicious!) The atmosphere was hip and quiet around 10:30 pm. The Bruschetta was delicious! I could eat it all the time! My entree was the Chicken Parm with a side of spaghetti. The chicken was very good but had a slight spicy taste so beware of you don't like spicy foods! I think that is why it didn't sit well with me." u'Ate here at lie evening. I ordered Grilled Chicken Pizza and it was bland and very spicy. I had felling that there is nothing else in pizza except pepper. Service was quick and adequate.' u"We were searching for a place to eat late in evening on Sunday night. They were one of the only places that didn't have a hour wait. We were mainly looking for pizza appetizers and salad. We had to wait for a little while since we were six people. The hostesses were great offering us menus other than the one posted outside and kept us informed about timing while we waited. Our server was accommodating and patient with us and our kids. The brussel sprouts appetizer was pretty good. the pizza had good flavor and enjoyed the rustic style. Our food came out in a decent amount of time but we didn't feel rushed to have to leave either. I think we were all surprised at the patience of the staff that deals with tourists all day long." u"This place was so great! We visited because of Restaurant.com and I'm so glad that we did! My mother and I ordered the seafood linguine which was so great! My husband had the pizza and he said it was close to authentic. The service was a little spotty but it was a busy Friday night. The decor is absolutely darling. Great experience here I'd totally eat here again when visiting the City." u'-1 Star just because I was unable to sit anywhere I wanted 2 and the a Restaurant was empty at the time' u"We had dinner here last night as it was close to our hotel. The decor was quaint and there were enough tables so that the wait was minimal for a weeknight. Food was mediocre/decent at best. Service was quick and adequate but the waiter did forget to bring out the bread while all other tables around us had theirs. Nothing too memorable and probably won't come back anytime soon. \xa0Too overpriced." u'Food is meh overpriced if you ask me. We ordered the beet salad risotto and seafood linguine. Risotto was way overlooked linguine was average though but the pasta was a planet away from al dente. Beet salad was the biggest waste of money. Service was ok nothing more than a 15% tips.' u"Food: 1.5 StarsService: 1.5 StarsCame here before our broadway show as other places were packed. At first thought it looked good but was extremely disappointed with how the meal turned out. First we had to wait a good 30 minutes before a table opened up. After being seated the food came out extremely slowly and it was nearly difficult to get the attention of any waiter. I ordered one of their pasta dishes and the noodles tasted like something out of a microwave dinner. Not Al Dente at all and it was like eating a thin piece of gum that would break ever so easily in your mouth. We also ordered an asparagus and egg appetizer which was fibrous beyond belief only included four short pieces of asparagus. For the price none of the dishes were worth it and portions were tiny. I actually went after dinner to buy some pies so that I wouldn't get hungry during our show. This place in my mind is just a tourists trap so I'd definitely recommend eating somewhere else." u"Looking for a restaurant to have dinner before heading to the Booth theatre we stumbled upon Il Forno and what a treat. Very nice decor and excellent service. The selling point besides the great food was the maitre d' Kevin what a character. He was funny and made amazing recommendations for our dinner AND dessert. We had the short rib which was so tender it almost melted in your mouth and the blacken sea bass which was seasoned exquisitely. Wasn't sure about dessert until Kevin insisted on the NY Cheesecake. It was the best we ever tasted even better than the world famous Junior's cheesecake!Our waiter was on point making sure we weren't rushed but wouldn't be late for our Broadway performance. If looking for a great restaurant in the theatre district be sure to stop into Il Forno. You won't be disappointed." u'Nice Italian food. Kinda averaged if you keep Up with your Italian cuisine. The capucino is sooo good. I recommend getting s dessert. Their cheesecake should win an award!!! So good!' u"Il Forno was an awesome find for a quick dinner surrounded by adorable Italian-esque ambiance. The Grilled Atlantic Salmon was really delicious with cucumber and tomato with a pesto sauce. It was the perfect amount of pesto. The Beet salad with purple and yellow beets goat cheese and pistachio nuts made a wonderful combination. The service was quick and the doors open so that you feel like you're basically sitting outside. I really enjoyed my experience here." u"Poor service perhaps understaffed? Ordered pizza had to ask for Parmesan. Asked For garlic and was told they didn't have any (!). Too many places to choose from don't go here." u"Cute place. Fun atmosphere. Traveled the world and I've now found the only two restaurants that don't have ice tea to drink while eating. Here's a thought to think about... If it's cold out do not come to this restaurant. The tables are place in the restaurant so when the front door is open you get hit with a blast of cold ..... Not pleasant Other than that the food isn't bad... Actually pretty good" u"Very tasty! A cute and nice restaurant in Hells Kitchen with great ambiance. The food was super good especially the polenta! GET THE POLENTA! We also ordered a pizza which was tasty. They messed up our order a bit but it was nothing major and I'd recommend this place to anyone in the neighborhood!" u'We ordered salads to start with which were huge. They brought our dinners out too early which would be my only complaint. I ordered the fish of the day which was red snapper yummy.' u'My experience here was inconsistent.No complaints about the Grilled Chicken Pizzette though which I thought was delicious.My friend and I both ordered the mixed greens salad to start and were surprised by how huge the portion size was. Had the waiter told us we would have ordered one to share. While the portion size was generous the flavor was lacking- the salad was severely underdressed. It seemed like a few drops of lemon juice was all they used and the majority of the plate was just plain greens. Not exactly a "lemon vinaigrette" as they claimed.For my main course I tried the Fusilli Bucati- I thought the flavor of the sauce (arugula pesto and asparagus) was excellent and different. I\'d eat it again. However my complaints about this dish:1. The pasta was definitely not al dente... It was extremely overcooked and very mushy. 2. It wasn\'t listed with any meat so when the waiter asked if I wanted chicken I simply said yes. When the dish came out the strips of dry cold chicken were placed around the side of the plate. Not incorporated into the dish at all and not appetizing. I would have been better off without adding the chicken which ended up costing an additional $5 (which the waiter did NOT tell me beforehand).Overall the waiter was very pushy with his recommendation of certain items- even when we made up our minds for example that we were going to pass on dessert. It left us feeling uncomfortable that he kept asking.' u"Just back from this nice restaraunt. They have very nice menu with option meal of the day. Cesar salad was very yummy. But it doesn't have included chicken/ bacon as many other places do. You can easily order as addition. Risotto with mushroom is magic. It's my first best place among Italian restaurants in New York :) I advice this place. The service is very good. And if I found this place in the first day of my vacation I would come back defenetly!!!"]
127.Azuki,[u"Located in the City Kitchen cafeteria is this sushi stand. I didn't expect much from a sushi in a food court but I was surprised of the quality and deliciousness of the sashimi I ordered here. I ordered the Azuki sashimi entree for $24. It came with a big container of rice and a huge portion of sashimi. There were five different types of fish and each fish came with three slices. The slices were very generous and were nice big/thick cuts of fish. The types of fish were: white fish salmon tuna white tuna and yellowtail. Everything was super fresh but my favorite was definitely the white tuna. Each bite of the white tuna melted into my mouth as I took each bite. I had to save the last piece to be the white tuna because it was just that yummy. The 15 pieces of sashimi surprisingly was very filling without eating too much rice! I would highly recommend this place!" u"I only gave it a 3-star because as a Hong Konger I have eaten in many good sushi place. This is slightly overrated and it's relatively pricey given its quality and quantity. But it's in the heart of NYC and I expected everything to be slightly pricey.There are many restaurants around. I won't recommend this place to People who'd like good Japanese food. It's like a footy court and azuki happens to be part of this place." u"We stay in the Row almost every time we come to the city so I am a regular at City Kitchen. Despite the crowds the space is pleasant and filled with delicious high end food options. I've gotten sushi at Azuki several times and I've never been disappointed.This trip we headed there to grab lunch after arriving in Manhattan mid-day. I got the lunch special - $11 for two maki rolls and a miso soup or soda can - and so did my mom/dining companion. I had a Cali roll and tuna roll with a Sprite and she had a Cali roll and salmon roll with miso.Everything was super tasty and fresh and you can't beat that price for sushi in Manhattan. Service was quick and we ate at the sushi bar counter. This is not the best sushi I've had in NYC but it is very good and I will surely be returning because of the convenience factor." u"So freaking fresh and fatty--the salmon and yellowtail sashimi (priced at $3.5 for two fat slices of each type) was unreal. I ordered salmon yellowtail and white tuna sashimi for lunch with an Asahi and it was enough to fill me up. Some of the best sashimi I've had for a great price will definitely be back!" u"Had a huge sushi craving and I was super determined to try out all the vendors in City Kitchen!So I ordered an Eel Avocado Roll ($7.50) and it was realllly good. My biggest problem with sushi is usually their generosity with the ingredients. But at Azuki the gave me a good amount of eel and a good load of avocado as well. It was too little where I felt like they were being cheap or too much where everything is falling apart! The roll was made on the spot so the rice was cold and hard. Only part that disappointed me was that they have Thai Iced Tea on the menu but it wasn't available when I ordered it." u"This review is for delivery only.After a long day's of work I was famished and craving for some Japanese. My usual go-to Japanese restaurant wasn't open so I decided to look for other places and stumbled upon Azuki which is newly opened.I ordered during dinner time via seamless. My seamless account had the default delivery time set at 8PM which I forgot to change. After getting my confirmation e-mail I started to reach for the phone to call them and update my delivery time. But before I could pick up the phone it started ringing and Azuki was on the other end. They called me to ask if I wanted my food to be delivered at the stated time or ASAP. I found this to be very attentive and I'm sure their service for customers dining in would be just as great.The food itself was very fresh and delicious. I got their 3 rolls special for $17 (eel avocado crunchy spicy tuna alaska roll) which comes with a miso soup! I also got their pork gyoza which was fried perfectly and remained crispy. Overall their prices are very affordable and you get a good amount of sashimi in your rolls. I will probably order from here again in the near future!" u'100% proper sushi. \xa0Extremely fresh and delicious.' u'Great sushi for a good price... Small cozy place with good service would definitely be back.']
155.Dos Caminos,[u"All I can say is WOW! One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. Very authentic menu & a huge variety of items! They even have skirt steak (arrachera) one of my favs. Good service. All employees are very friendly. Good size restaurant for Times Square. They also have a downstairs. It's connected to my hotel W Times Square very convenient. Fun atmosphere!Ordered traditional guacamole appetizer accompanied w chips & three salsas. One salsa was salsa verde bursting w flavor. Next was a chile-salsa medium hot which was delicious but I couldn't quite puck out which chile it was. Last salsa Was muy caliente - I think habanero based. I ordered the appetizer trio including chicken taquitos plantain empanadas & mini lobster tacos. Plate presentation was beautiful! My food was accompanied with salsas & crema fresca to enhance the flavor of my food. I def plan on eating here every time I come to NYC!" u'Food tastes good but not for the price. I purchased "tacos arabes" & a "grapefruit margarita". The tacos were $18. There were 3 tacos and each taco was about 3 bites. The margarita was $15. It tasted good as well but as it was mostly ice I probably had 6 or 7 sips of margarita. Tax & a 15% tip made it a grand total of $41.23 So it tasted good but you could get a similar quality dinner for 1/3rd the price at a regular tacoria. I\'m giving it 3 stars since the food was good but no more stars because it was overpriced.' u"We arrived around brunch and didn't expect much from this place but to my surprise they had a whole bunch menu to itself. We were seated quickly in the downstairs dining area without a reservation. The downstairs has its own bar and TVs for viewing of sports events and what not.We were greeted quickly and ordered our drinks. The coffee was nice strong and heated since it was being held in a thermos so I'm not sure if it was brew at the time or for the breakfast crowd. We order guacamole and we're asked the heat intensity we would like and chose spicy. They don't skimp out on the heat levels here spicy is indeed spicy. The small guacamole was pretty big to be honest and we had to stop ourselves from getting full off of it.When the main course came it all looked great. I ordered the brunch tacos and couldn't wait to dig in. They tasted delicious and would recommend it to anyone. My sister ordered the egg enchiladas and cheese was melted on top and sat on a skillet. It tasted awesome too. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to get great Mexican. The downstairs area feels private also compared to the location." u"Came for dinner with two of my old coworkers so we can catch up eat some guac and drink margaritas. This location is the latest for Dos Caminos. It's pretty much in the midst of Times Square. Made reservations on opentable. It was a Monday night so it wasn't crowded. We were seated right away. Our waiter was really cool and friendly. We ordered margaritas that were yummy. Guacamole for the table. We all ordered tacos but I got mine naked. Which came with quinoa. Service was good food is good. I'll come back to this location again." u"This place has the best margaritas I've ever had! We've been here several times. You can't beat the location; it is right in Times Square. They have large glass windows that overlook the TKTS area. It's perfect to sit eat and people watch. Like I mentioned their margaritas are delicious. My favorite is the prickly pear margarita. They are quite strong so plan accordingly. Food- wise they have a good selection. To me it felt a bit over priced but you have to expect that in Times Square. Still $30 for a large guacamole appetizer seems a bit ridiculous." u"The food is disgusting  the workers don't do anything but stand around and talk to each other . The hosts are stuck up and they take forever . Super pricey not worth time or money . I would recommend you go to Taco Bell if you are in NY and craving Mexican food" u"The food was good but nothing special. Being from South Florida the food was over priced for what it was. I got a veggie quesadillas and my cousin has chicken chimichangas with BBQ sauce which \xa0I thought was an American twist. We also got a side of rice and beans which I will say was pretty awesome! It was seasoned rice and whole black beans so so yummy! The service was nice. If you go down to the basement there a complimentary coat service (I'm from Miami and we don't have coat services so I don't know the proper name sorry!) The basement is more loungy there is music and couches to eat at and hangout at the bar. The upstairs has a more \xa0restaurant feel to it. So you have options to what type of environment you want to be at. In my opinion the food was over priced for what it was and from where I'm from. Aside from that the food was good." u"I've always avoided this place. Like always. I went a few years ago and thought man what a waste of money. I went again just a day ago and thought man what a waste of money. Tourists who hoard up wads of cash just so they can dump it at places like this is what keeps venues like Dos Caminos alive. They think it's okay to have mediocre food for a lot of money. The guacamole is okay. I got the fish tacos. So bland except for the slight char flavor which just made it worse. My lunch buddy had something on the app list. She could not finish it. She offered to have me taste but I took her word for it that it was not that good. So 2 apps 1 entree $60 lunch (after tip). Unbelievable." u"I have been now to probably all of the Dos Caminos restaurant locations. Each has its own amazing feeling and while the food is the same the ambiance is definitely one thing that is not. for this location I find that while not the most impressive I think it has the best view of all of their restaurants. Who does not like to enjoy their prickly pear margarita while people watching at Time's Square but just I case you don't they have a downstairs bar and seating area as well get away from the city!!My personal favorite drink at Dos is a basic frozen margarita with a shot of sangria. Now some of the other restaurants have the perfect ratio and this Dos Caminos is still starting their ways. when I asked for it the bartender had no idea they even served that at their restaurants he still obliged with a smile and commented on how it just makes sense as a drink. I happen to fully agree with him! It took several tries then again. I also had several of these. Therefor it is important to not just enjoy your margaritas with some water and be responsible but also some food. And I can't think of a better thing to munch on then their pastelitos of sweet banana filled with black beans and grated cheese on top served over a spicy sauce. These 4 succulent little bitters are a perfect way to tidy up a chill moment at Dos Caminos!I also had a grapefruit margarita which I definitely did not enjoy and did not have to pay for. I love tequila I love grapefruit but I wish the description had said it would basically taste like tootsie rolls. Yes that is what this Margarita tasted like and no I was not prepared hahah! I do appreciate the bartender trying to get me to try something different and after he saw my immediate reaction he understood it was not something I would ever order again. Still presentation was great so I took a picture and yelped that! I have not bought anything else at this location but their menu at their other locations is basically the same and I have enjoyed my meals there. The only thing I really feel like I have not enjoyed is the small amount of salsas that come with the chips and salsa. That said they are still pretty tasty.Dos Caminos is a staple Mexican restaurant that is enjoyable and usually pretty interesting to be at (decor wise). This is a great second or third date location to enjoy the food drinks but if bored of the date then to people watch!!" u'I met two friends for lunch here today. It was their choice and i had wanted to try this relatively new place. we were seated immediately and given menus. Shortly after we ordered and they got margaritas [which they said were very good] and I got ice water. My friends ordered from the brunch menu and I ordered from the general menu. One friend got the mexican pancakes which she said was very good and the other got huevos rancheros. I got the shrimp quesadilla which came with larger shrimp mushrooms red peppers and cheese. It was delicious. I would recommend and return however in the area where we were seated there were a lot of people around us and the noise level made it difficult to hear what my friends were saying on the other side of the table. Despite this we had a great time.' u'Dos Caminos is a great concept. This newer restaurant in Times Square is really gorgeous. My favorite cocktails are the Mexican Star and the Grilled grapefruit Margarita. For apps I get the guacamole salsa trio and the Ceviches sampler with the tuna being my favorite. For entree the steak alambre is what I usually go for. Service is great and all the staff are really friendly.' u"I like other Dos Caminos locations and have always gotten the best of service but this location leaves a lot to be desired. I came for happy hour with a couple of friends after work and grabbed a seat at the bar. The bartender was not attentive towards us at all. He didn't offer us chips like he offered the other patrons. We asked him for two pear margaritas and he gave us regular ones. When we politely tried to get his attention he ignored us. When we finally did get his attention he switched our drinks to the right order but they were overflowing so much so that we couldn't even touch the glasses. He didn't even offer us napkins to clean the glasses off. To make matters worse when he did give us the chips and salsa he pushed it over to us on the bar in a rude manner. I've never had service like this at a Dos Caminos before. I'm sure this will be my last time at this location." u"Service at this place is really bad so don't expect to be in and out. Took 15 minutes for someone to stop and put our name on a list and that's only because we flagged her down. The food was alright. Ordered nachos and it was a huge serving so that was a plus. I'd skip the enchiladas next time nothing too special about them. The environment is pretty cool you feel like you're in a different world when you're inside. Could definitely find a better place in new haven." u'Love everything about this place! Fun atmosphere great service (loved our waiter) and great location in times square. \xa0Tried Queso Fundeto (sp) for the first time and loved it!!! Good size restaurant got seated right away with reservations on a Saturday night. \xa0Overall a great time!' u"Guac was awesome but the drinks were a bit watered down. Service was great. Apps were also good. My dinner was quite gross though. I got the naked tacos and my chicken was chewy and gross. Didn't eat them." u"Ugh I have to say I was absolutely disappointed in today's service. Its been some time since I been to a dos caminos and wanted to have a nice lunch date with my cousin. I cant even talk about food since we NEVER got it!! Got there at a good time with a reservation so there was no waiting. We ordered within 10 min since I was limited to an hour and wanted to make the best of it on catching up rather than staring at a menu. My cuzzo ordered a beer at first and never did get his beverage. we were not offered anything to snack on while waiting and had to repeatedly ask the ETA on our food. 45 min passed and decided.... we are just going to leave. wouldn't have time to eat the food anyway if it decided to come out! what trumps me is that our waitress had no idea when our food would come out. we didn't get anything complicated! so i was just baffled at why it was taking 40 min to but a taco bowl together and to bring out 1 beer! sorry dos caminos very disappointed. wont ever come back to times square again!" u"Ryan Millis is awesome. I'm sort of a picky eater/ annoying customer and he was such a great server. He is extremely polite and attentive. I would def recommend this lace and especially this server!" u"Had lunch at this branch of Dos Caminos for the first time today. Mostly because my 11-year-old begged me to go there to celebrate her birthday. I had my reservations since our last venture to the Dos Caminos in Meatpacking was kind of a disaster. But I'm happy to report that our lunch was surprisingly good!Ambiance - I don't love that this Dos Caminos is basically in a windowless basement but the place was well lit so it didn't feel like a basement. The restaurant wasn't too full or noisy at 2pm on a Sunday.Service - EXCELLENT. We had the nicest waitress who checked on us frequently and even brought on some rice and beans on the house. Food was overall quite good.-- Mahi Naked Bowl was delicious. Love that the Mahi was wild and good quality. I highly recommend this dish as did my husband who ordered the same thing.-- Kid's Taco Plate was quite small and my daughter and her friend basically polished it off in 2 minutes (thus the need for additional orders of rice and beans). Not sure the meat quality was all that because they left a few chewy pieces behind but overall I know they enjoyed their meals.Overall I was quite happy with Dos Caminos. Prices are on the high side ($18 for the Mahi Bowl $26 for a large guacamole) and portions are on the small side - thus why this place loses a star. Still I think we'll return!" u'This was our last minute place to go yesterday right before our concert. Banging margaritas ! And fish tacos. Highly recommend to sit at the bar and enjoy a nice meal before hitting a show or for drinks at the bar.' u"It's a nice little fancy place. Thy have two floors. Service is fast given the large crowd. Drinks are really good. I had the smoke and ash cocktail which was very very good and strong. The guacamole is as good as they come. Food is very good too. I had the veggie market quesadilla. Yummy. Good service.!"]
184.Glass House Tavern,[u"A casual 4 stars but I'll give it to them.Food: I was there with one other person. Both of us ordered from the pre fix menu. Orders included the quinoa salad and the shrimp & mango salad to start followed by two turkey burgers with sriracha slaw and fries and to finish pineapple bread pudding. All for $25 per person. Everything was very good and also a great value play. Service: polite. We didn't really test our server but no complaints.Atmosphere: casual clean not a whole lot of natural light but no problem with the lighting comfortable." u'Came in here Thursday evening because I had some time to kill before a show. This place is right around the corner from Broadway/all the theaters. It wasn\'t crowded or loud like many other establishments in the area which was ideal for me considering I was alone.The gin cucumber rickey was strong and refreshing. I was unusually nervous/stressed that day and this did the trick. I would recommend.For food I ordered off the bar menu - mac and cheese (with onions truffle and bacon...what a combo!) It came out *sizzling* and ended up being OK. It was more cheese than mac which sounds like a good thing but really just overwhelming and not filling. Everyone that works here is attractive and sharply dressed.The service was OK wouldn\'t call it attentive or friendly but still polite. The bartender didn\'t have much of a presence yet when I needed another drink he was there.I don\'t go to shows often nor do usually have to "kill time" waiting for others but if I find myself in either of those situations again I might return here for a drink or two. Probably not for the food though because it seems expensive for what you get.All around Glass House Tavern is OK.' u'We took a day trip to NYC and decided to have lunch before a show. We were falling a little behind schedule and we needed to eat fast. We asked our bright and happy waitress if she could bring the food out ASAP. No problem. The food was delicious our waitress was super nice and the food was prepared quickly(for 8 people!!!!) would recommend this restaurant!!!! V(^_^)V' u"It's a fiver. Hands down. Terrific environment great conversations(at the bar!) and a very NYC place to be. It's classy and chic and the food was wonderful! I had a Grilled cheese w/ bacon and tomato and husband had Seared Tuna and calamari. Foodies! This is right up your alley when in the city. Freddie was our bartender and he was great!" u"TL; DR - Perhaps there are gems on the full menu. \xa0But how often are they prepared properly as to be gems when what I experienced showed a serious lack of quality control in chef's kitchen? \xa0If I'm spending $110 for four drinks and two appetizers everything needs to be on-point every time I visit; from server etiquette and finesse to space to ambiance to execution of every beverage and dish...and I should never feel that I'm receiving less than my fellow diners.Full review:I'm torn. \xa0So much potential for this to actually be an on-point classy-though-accessible pre-show dining option. \xa0It is certainly an acceptable option for pre-show drinks (all four craft cocktails we ordered were either good or excellent). \xa0And the ambiance is built to easily be lovely. \xa0But the finesse needed to nail all these options just wasn't there last night and has given me serious pause as to whether I want to give it another chance.Comfortable bar seating. \xa0Lovely - and acoustically pleasing - space design. \xa0Though the bartender didn't really greet or welcome us even while cleaning the area to start our service. \xa0It took him about ten minutes to make two drinks (and he was only making ours). \xa0Worst of all he would slam the shakers down on the bar hard enough to shake it and us loud jarring noise to boot (very LES dive bar style).Then the manager set up a three-top directly behind us in the only walking space there was....which led to us being unnecessarily cramped and frequently bumped...Then we spotted a hostess dressed more casually than the same at Virgil's which changed the tone of the place....Still a 3-star rating until it came to the food.The gentlemen next to us were watching their watches making comment on how long their order was taking. \xa0When it came out the tortellini in broth looked less than impressive (same as most other dishes we'd been eyeing at the bar) though the mussels and sesame-crusted tuna both looked quite good. \xa0The tuna looked especially tempting since it was a perfect rare cook and 7-8 generous pieces with the end pieces not included on the plate.We ordered one tuna for each of us. \xa0My friend received five pieces but with a proper cook. \xa0I received four pieces the two center of which were overcooked and two end pieces to boot all with burnt sesame coating. \xa0Clearly no consistency in portion size fillet weight or quality evident by three identical dishes served quite differently (two of which were for the same dining party!). \xa0This was even more off-putting considering the price tag which is greater than the area high-end sushi restaurants my friend and I have enjoyed (I paid over $4 per piece of overcooked tuna with burnt seasoning; maddening).Might pop in with this same friend if he brings it up. \xa0At this point not likely to try again on my own accord or to recommend to any other of my theater friends." u"We stumbled upon this place when looking for something that would be open on New Years Day. If I had seen the three $ signs on Yelp I probably wouldn't have chosen it but it turned out to be more affordable than I thought. We mostly stuck to appetizers but we weren't super hungry so that was just right for us. The boyfriend and I shared an Egg Nog cocktail which was amazing ($13 - not bad). The bar menu has some cheaper options for those looking to save a bit more money. Surprisingly the place wasn't crowded and we got seated immediately. The server was prompt and friendly. I had the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I misread on the menu so was expecting it there to be more than one haha. It came with some zoodles (zucchini noodles) on the side. I thought I'd end up being hungry later but it was pretty filling! They also serve some nice assorted breads for the table. Overall it's a good place if you're in the area and looking to have a quiet dinner/appetizer/drink!" u'Pleasant place for a late lunch. \xa0Decent draft selection interesting and tasty options on the menu and good service. \xa0Comfortable and quiet.' u'I made last-minute pre-show reservations here based on the decent-ish reviews on Yelp and boy what a disaster. \xa0I inadvertently gave my mom who was visiting \xa0a true New York experience -- \xa0"getting screwed by an overpriced crappy restaurant in Times Square."We had an hour and 45 minutes to eat and the waitress asked when we sat down if we were on our way to a show. \xa0You would think this would mean some urgency in taking the order serving the food bringing the check etc. -- but no. \xa0In fact if anything it seemed to make everything move in slow motion. \xa0We did not get ANY food for over an \xa0hour and after complaining to the manager absolutely no effort was made to speed up the process (or at leas try to appease us with drinks or something.) \xa0Speaking of drinks. \xa0We ordered 2 bottles of champagne at the beginning of the meal -- clearly we were there to celebrate! \xa0Why then were we never given another opportunity to order more booze? \xa0Now we were sober and hangry.Adding insult to injury once the food came out it was a colossal disappointment. \xa0The veggies were undercooked and unseasoned. \xa0The steak was lukewarm like it had been sitting under a burner for hours. \xa0Everything was "meh" or worse and we paid $60/person for the privilege of nearly missing our show. \xa0Avoid this place at all costs!' u"Very nice restaurant sensitive to time and excellent service.On a trip to see Lea Mis we needed a place to eat. The original place I called the day before said that no reservation would be necessary. So I didn't make one when we arrived they could not seat us undeterred we walked next door and had a great experience. We were seated in the upstairs by the window which is quieter than the ground floor with the bar. We were greeted quickly by a smiling waitress who took our drink order and the. Asked if we were going to the theater tonight when we said that we were she said she'd make sure everything came quickly. I had roast duck my wife had a fish dish & my mother got pasta. Everything was delicious. Cooked very well flavor in every bite. Everything tastes and felt upscale. The food was certainly a quality not quantity approach but no one felt cheated wen the plates were empty.The manager came over and said he felt like it took too long to get food to our table and he'd like to offer us desserts on the house. No one had complained or said anything I honestly didn't even think it was that long but I appreciate sentiment. I had strawberry shortcake with lemon creme my wife got the bread pudding and my mother got apple crisp. I liked mine best but it was all pretty great.Fun night and a great send off to the theater for $100 bucks plus tip. Worth stopping in if you're in the theater district." u'I Love New York ......and now I Love the Glass House Tavern. \xa0From this day forward all other Bolognese dishes will have to be compared to the pasta and sauce served in this contemporary style eatery. They blended lamb with a mouthwatering sauce over curled pasta balls from heaven. I definitely over ate and wanted to lap up every spec of sauce with bread. \xa0Everything else in the menu is 5 stars as well!!!High tailing back the minute I return to the Big Apple!!' u'This is a good restaurant. Food was good. Salad tasty and the main courses were good. The food is very good. The sad part of this place is that manager owner was reprimanded multiple employees right in front of us throughout the meal. This is not a very good way to run a restaurant. One was a new employee. This is a sign of a low life owner who wants to make money that he is willing to mistreat his employees. Not a place I will go back to because of that. It is a shame.' u'Our group of 5 ate here for brunch/lunch before a Saturday matinee. Great location great food lots of options - a perfect place to dine before the theater. Yes it is pricey - but welcome to NYC especially convenient to the theater district. Our waiter was attentive mindful of our theater plans but did not push us out when we had a few extra minutes before we had to leave. A great choice!' u"A nice spot in the Theater District to check out before or after a show.We actually went on a week night during evening show time and did not need a reservation. \xa0Our waitress Emily was very attentive and helpful with/knowledgeable about the menu. \xa0They have a nice prix fixe option ; I went with the salmon and corn risotto which was very good. \xa0The blood orange garnish was a nice touch (I think it was a blood orange?). I'm a sucker for a bread pudding and their pineapple version didn't disappoint. \xa0Nice low light ambience and quiet enough to have a good conversation although we were upstairs away from the bar. \xa0I'd definitely go back." u'Disappointing. I\'m always cautious of restaurants close to Times Square and it seems I was right to be.We went for restaurant week and it\'s most definitely not worth the price even with the prix fixe menu. The place was completely empty -- the neon sign of all disappointments. No exaggeration we were the only ones in the place. This only hits home harder when you remember the bulk of human civilization quite literally two blocks away. Despite the fact that we were the only ones in the restaurant for a good half hour it was nearly impossible to flag down the wait staff.Appetizer game is WEAK -- a parfait and fresh fruits and berries. Ugh you might as well release me into the wilderness and let me forage for myself. It only starts off the meal on a sour note when there\'s clearly so little effort. Roast corn & cous cous "risotto" with an Atlantic salmon filet for entree. Not scrap out my tongue awful but the fish was bland and generally forgettable. Certainly not inspiring any future visits.I did like the panna cotta at the end but at this point there\'s really no saving the whole experience. Check please.' u"Food was ok no real complaints about the food - but service was pretty bad. Our server was more interested in the other employees and what was on the television. Wouldn't go back." u"I despise Times Square so much everything is so tacky and fake and every restaurant is a chain with terrible food. With that being said I randomly stopped in this place the other day and really liked it. As another reviewer said and I agree it feels like your local restaurant. It's a nice bar that I would describe as new casual comfortable trendy and tastefully decorated it's the type of bar I would want to go for happy hour after work. I can't stand the Irish pubs in Midtown that smell like beer it's loud and over crowded and everyone seems to be wasted. No thanks. Moving on the two times I have been here there have been a fair share of people but not so busy you wait 30 minutes at the bar just to get a drink. Fairly upscale crowd although with anything in Times Square you will always get annoying tourists. Anyway they have a decent cocktail menu the bartenders know how to make drinks and they're pretty friendly. I had their rice balls the other day which I highly recommend (6 small rice balls with truffle that comes with a side of parmesan like aioli). Delicious." u"came here last saturday after a matinee. had one of the prex-fixe meals (quinoa & mushroom salad/salmon/choc cake) and it was very good. each of us had a dif meal from the prex-fixe and everyone was happy. service was good too but not rushed. the place was packed but it wasn't crazy loud. only downside drinks are a bit pricey. $10 for a quarter glass of house merlot. i get the 10 bucks at least fill the glass 1/2 way." u"Perfect location because I am seeing Waitress: The Musical right next door. Recommend making reservations as it is a small restaurant. Did pre fixe dinner menu for $39. Enjoyed each course. Nice light tasty Thai-inspired shrimp and green mango salad for starter. Best grilled salmon I've ever had- cooked perfectly (medium). Pineapple bread pudding was a sweet way to end the meal with the added surprise of currents. Excellent prompt service with knowledgable server. Overall highly recommend for pre-show dinner!" u"Love this place for drinks and appetizers. The risotto balls are a must try! Energetic and fun atmosphere without being so loud you can't hear your friends. Service is friendly and attentive." u'Popped in here last minute before a show and was pleasantly surprised especially since we normally avoid restaurants near Times Square. Food was terrific. I had the Shrimp Fettucini with a Pea pesto and the hubby had the Seafood Spagetini. We both loved our meals and the service was terrific too. We were on a time crunch to go catch a show at the Lyceum theatre nearby and they served us super quick. Great experience I would definetely recommend.']
204.Haven Rooftop,[u'My company had a work event here recently.The staff was super friendly and accommodating - they would also ask if we wanted more water or drinks etc. They even kept our little cocktail tables clean/clear throughout the night.The venue was nice - kind of had a hard time finding it when we got to the top floor and we wound up using the emergency exit? Food:We had mini appetizers. The tuna tartar on a chip was my favorite. SO GOOD. I had like 3 of them. The burger slider mushroom risotto and veggie spring roll - also very good. The only thing that kept me from enjoying this place thoroughly was the fact that it was like 95 degrees and 90% humity and they only had a couple fans running. We were all melting.' u"Pretty bad.i stopped by this place while visiting NYC with friends.I was actually looking for some cool rooftop with a viewfound this on my google search.Not view at allplace is tinywith no decorjust a small bar a small sitting area.It's was HH timebut they didn't have pretty much anything to offer.Bartender: she wasn't any excitedwelcoming or much helpful about menu.Drinks:badwe had couple and no one really enjoyed them.artificial is how I would describe then in one word." u'This is a nice venue. Cool ambiance on the rooftop. Fans but no AC. Waiters and waitresses were very attentive. We got a table and ordered drinks. The cuddle on the beach shots were good. Even thought about having their ski shots which would have been fun but too much work.The hummus and pita were \xa0a warm and tasty appetizer!' u"Staying across street asked desk clerk where should I go to have a cold draft. He said right across \xa0street. So here I am. Sure enough cold beer on tap. \xa0Albeit only 3 to chose from. Sapporo Stella and an IPA. Had a Sapporo and an order of wings. Actually the wings were pretty tasty! \xa0Its a hotel lobby bar so didn't expect them to be this tasty. Well done!" u'*Disclaimer: Lots of compliments followed by "but" for this restaurant lol.I\'ve been meaning to check out a rooftop restaurant or bar in the city for a while now so I was really happy to see a deal for one! I bought a LivingSocial deal here for one appetizer or salad to share (up to $15) two entrees (up to $25 each) and two cocktails (up to $14 each) for my boyfriend and myself. Be sure to read the fine print for the voucher before you make a reservation because you can\'t use the deal on Fridays or Saturdays. Also if you like something that exceeds what the deal covers they let you order the food and pay the difference. Just thought it was worth mentioning because some places don\'t let you order outside the deal\'s price range!Drinks: We both ordered a Solstice cocktail. So yummy I recommend it! But we got the smallest serving ever. I know Prosecco is served in a champagne glass but our glasses weren\'t even halfway full with the other ingredients added.Appetizer: The mushroom risotto was flavorful creamy and generous with mushrooms! But the risotto rice tasted slightly undercooked.Entrees: I got steak au poivre cooked medium. I got such a generous NY strip steak that was seasoned perfectly and the fries on the side were nice and crispy! But it tasted really dry for a medium. Manny got the sesame crusted tuna. He said that the seaweed salad was amazing and it tasted super fresh but he wished they served a bigger portion because he was still hungry when we left.Service: I\'ve read awful reviews about the elevator guy being rude or pushy but I guess Manny and I got lucky this past Sunday evening because the elevator guy we met was very courteous and kind. He even offered to take pictures for us in front of the fireplace! The restaurant staff was great too; everyone was welcoming and helpful. Our server (Genesis I think?) was awesome!Rooftop view and decor: The rooftop view was lacking. We had a gorgeous view of a parking garage and tall business buildings (sarcasm lol). But the d\xe9cor for their "Winter Wonderland" was so cute! Beautiful lighting and snowflakes everywhere!I\'d rather try another rooftop restaurant than come back here and pay full price for our next meal but I\'m glad we gave this place a try.' u"Visit Date: February 11 2016 My friend and I came here for dinner when she found a deal through travel zoo. The atmosphere is incredible and fun the staff is so very friendly but the food is definitely not much to talk about. My advice would be to come here for some cocktails and enjoy the lounge \xa0but I wouldn't eat here again. I'm not sure what they do in the summer but in the winter they enclose the rooftop so you can be on it but still be warm and they decorate it like a little ski chalet which was definitely half the fun of dining here. To be on a Manhattan rooftop is also a very incredible feeling I like it better in the warmth but I appreciate the fact that at least this place encloses their rooftop for the winter so you can enjoy it year round. For an app we had the guac & chips. It was honestly so so. The chips weren't flavorful and the guac had no flavor either. For dinner I had the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle sauce. Tasted like there was no truffle sauce on it just a bland flavorless white sauce. For dessert we shared the s'mores for two which sounded a lot better than how it actually came. You can't really mess s'mores up but the menu said the peanut butter was warm and it was cold. Also the presentation of the dessert could have been better. So my recommendation is to drink cocktails here if that's your thing but unless they improve the food service you can skip dining here." u'I was looking for a decent place for Happy hour after work to celebrate my birthday I came across this place...Sometimes working in this area u forget that there are hidden places like this. We came in & settled towards the back by the bar area within a few minutes by chance we got lucky & were able to grab a table & chairs. They offer limited happy hour specials selected beers & house wines. We started with some wine  Pinot Grigio is always a good choice for me .. Good wine. After a few we moved onto some different drinks I went with Stoli raspberry & cranberry not bad  friends had Jack & diet also good. After a few drinks we decide to get some food. We ended up ordering Truffle Fries  Calamari & Wings. Truffle fries are very good  good dipping sauce with the truffle taste. Calamari was good as well. The wings were also not bad nice & crispy but kinda on the small size. As for the place itself good set up with plenty of tables to sit  decent music playing good atmosphere. Being that the weather was a bit unpredictable I enjoyed the enclosed space it was nice to enjoy being on a roof top without having to worry if it was going to rain on my parade. Bartenders were nice & attentive  good service not sure on prices since my friends were treating I believe when we looked the place up it was reasonable. Always nice to find a decent place to enjoy happy hour  we had a good time & chances are I will come back from time to time.' u'Amazing atmosphere! Great drinks! The food could be better ALOT better ... I had the salmon it was very dry and had no taste.' u"Friends took me here on Cinco de Mayo. It was very crowded! The drinks were delicious but because of the crowd we decided to head out after 2 drinks. Would love to check this place out when I'm in town again." u'The rooftop bar was closed due to a private party and we were asked to visit the secondary rooftop bar which was only accessible by going down a second flight of stairs. After the journey to the second very crowded small outdoor bar we were greeted by lackluster service and ok drinks. I will probably not return.' u'I cam to Haven Rooftop to meet up with a friend before heading to a Broadway show. I would say that the cool ambiance of being on the rooftop good DJ and a young yuppie 20-30 crowd definitely puts Haven Rooftop up there. The location is prime in Midtown/Time Square area but not filled with tourists so definitely a good experience. Drink was strong. Reasonably priced for NYC. Definitely a kind of place where you would come after work and relax with coworkers and friends.' u'On making my reservation I was warned about "our dress code: business casual." But when push came to shove... there was neither. We saw guys in shorts and plenty of jeans and sneakers. What we weren\'t warned about was the BAG CODE... no back packs. I\'m not sure what the other rules are especially for women\'s bags. The checkroom is next to the elevator and the tuxedo-ed button pusher will make the final determination. Beware!There is a small under-the-sky space in the center on the roof. On one side is a covered area with a DJ... WHAT?? On the other side is a covered area without a DJ nice but not really rooftop. The Slavic staff was very professional if a bit on the cool side. The beer selection was bottles only-- all bigger brewers or their recent purchases. (Can you say Anheuser Busch = Goose Island?) The mussels were tasty and filling. One order is enough for two-- or three if you\'re not super hungry. (Our server called them "small personal sizes" when we ordered.) Two orders of mussels and 2 pizzas (okay... nice crust otherwise not special) took care of the six of us. Not a bad night but not really an orgasm either. --Drink Club is a roving group of NYC drinkers. A different bar every week.' u'Nice staff....really nice view. Love the sesame encrusted tuna. Can I please have my New York up with a twist. Here are some pics.' u'The decor service  food and the view from the rooftop restaurant was wondering. Very nice restaurant to dine and socialize with friends.' u'Not much has changed since I was last here and wrote my original review. Unfortunately this place has not gotten any better. Not only everyone gets carded downstairs you cannot get in wearing flip flops either (a friend of ours was forced to go to the office to change shoes). We tried ordering a pitcher of mojito but were told by our very detached waitress that pitchers are not being served at this time as on Thursdays they can get more money from individual mojito orders. We settled for sangrias - better to say sangria flavored water. There was almost no flavor and none of us got buzzed even thought we each had 4-5 glasses. Every minute someone came to our table either trying to take away the food we were still eating or asking us how we were doing. However when we asked to have our wobbling table steadied no one did anything.' u"Came here for Happy Hour with a couple of friends. However we lost our table because people had reservations at 7:30pm (despite being kicked off at 7pm..) so we were forced to stand around randomly just to find spots.Elevator - the wait is so long!! I guess with the hotel being a hotel and all.. the elevator has to stop at more than one floor so it takes a while to get down to the lobby. I think I waited 10 min altogether and the line was out the door from the elevator. At least there are couches around if you need to sit and the lobby has a very nice interior decoration.The bartenders were nice drinks were decent and the view is alright (you really only see typical office buildings around.. not so much the city view). However if the game is on at least you'd be able to watch it if you were standing in front of the bar.Smoking areas are available near the bathrooms (there are only two bathrooms by the way.. Unisex but the place isn't really all that big so it's enough for the guests). Couple of security guards who stand around in case anything goes wrong and to make sure people aren't smoking in non-smoking permitted areas. There are also two floors to the rooftop - one higher and one lower. I'd had prefer to be on the upper level but since my friends could not find space on top we had to make do with the lower level. No complaints really.. just that it's not as high up as I'd have prefer.Food is alright.. ordered the hummus platter. I mean what can you really go wrong with pita bread and hummus.. We did also try the pizza which tasted homemade and sliders but nothing really out of the ordinary that made me want to REALLY go back there again.Pricing - city pricing which will cost you $5 per beer and $7 per wine for Happy Hour only! (I think it's either 4-7pm or 5-7pm). Otherwise each drink is $8 for beer and obviously a bit more for cocktails. The Manhattan wasn't bad - not too strong yet not watered down that I couldn't taste anything. Sangrias were really good! Tasted more so like juice than anything yet you get the feeling knowing it's an alcoholic beverage.Prob. wouldn't pick this place as the top choice for a rooftop bar next time.. There are better places in midtown around the 34th street area that I'd prefer with better views and music choice." u"I went here in Feb on a Sat night at 11pm. We were walking by and saw the entrance and thought it looked interesting so we decided to go in.In short: the main floor is a bit fancy. I liked that. The rooftop place is very cute. You take a small elevator up to the rooftop deck (for us it was enclosed due to winter time) but it was nicely decorated. There was snow flakes hanging from the ceiling and snow decorations. It was small only a few high top tables and couches and what not. But it could be a really nice place to just chill in the summer when its open and nice weather. Crowd was very diverse mostly young people ages 21-26.The thing I didn't like was the pricing. It was $14 for a martini drink but it was very small. In their defense it was a strong drink though. But after venturing here we went to another bar and got a much bigger martini for only $12. I would still return though I think." u'Good food. Overpriced. BAD service.The food was great but everything is extremely overpriced and the service is absolutely terrible. Mistakes are okay but take responsibility for the mistakes you make. Snippy remarks from waitresses and rude remarks from the elevator attendant are NOT okay.' u'This place is beautiful but while here two other tables literally got in a fight with the staff. The workers are very slow to attending tables and delivering drinks and food. Plan to wait awhile if you want to go to this restaurant. The view and atmosphere is why I rated it well.' u"Enjoyed a fun night out here with about 12 others last night. The servers and hostess were very accommodating and pleasant the entire night! The only thing that I thought was weird was their pricing. I asked for a titos and club: $14 next time I just asked for vodka club and they poured grey goose: $14 then I got stoli club and one time it was $14 the next time it was $12. So either vodka club is the same price for any kind of vodka or the bartenders are just making up prices. Regardless this place had great music and a great vibe we'll definitely be back!"]
62.Tartina,[u"Tartina offered a delicious tour of authentic Italian cuisine in a romantic dimly lit environment. There were a number of tantalizing specials to choose from but I went with the conchigliette stuffed with mozzarella di bufala. Divine. Wow. While I waited my expert server and guide Alexey recommended a cocktail made with whiskey balsamic and strawberry. What an experience. I'm usually wary of any kind of beer or cocktail that's overly sweet and fruity but this smooth drink hit just the right balance. He also recommended the most perfect glass of wine with my dinner. I can't remember exactly what it was but after the cocktail I had to trust the guy and I was certainly not mistaken to do so--it paired perfectly with the cochigliette. After dinner I went for the hosuemade chocolate hazelnut cake served with a scoop of gelato. Very much worth the wait. Thank you Alexey for my introduction to New York Italian! You are the master. Please send my compliments to the chef. Buonissimo!" u"This is a 2.5 star review. \xa0Honestly there's nothing glaringly wrong with Tartina. \xa0The service wasn't horrible and the food didn't make me queasy. \xa0It's just that nothing stands out at all I felt no reason why I'd come back. \xa0The pasta was uninspired and I've had better at multiple restaurants within 2 blocks of Tartina. \xa0The dishes were very by the numbers and the taste was just bland or so-so. \xa0I'd recommend several other Italian places in the neighborhood before them." u"To be completely honest I have only had the fish here and because it's so good that's probably all I'll order. Although slightly over salted the Orata is full of flavor. Skip the side of escarole altogether. The appetizer of poletna with ground veal was the superstar of the evening though. Five stars for that.Alexy also knows what he's talking about when he makes menu suggestions so listen carefully :)" u'Had an amazing brunch experience here. Alexey was extremely attentive and made our dinning experience unforgettable.' u"Alexey helped us pick a great wine and was very helpful with food pairings. A top-notch romantic quiet atmosphere that makes you forget you're in Times Square." u'A manhattan style brunch place. Decor: simple but chic. I called to make reservations for brunch and when I walked in 30 minutes early there was no wait and a table with a sign was waiting for me and my friends.The drinks that come with brunch were great. I had prosecco and it was just perfect!For food I ordered the salmon and poached eggs with potatoes. My eggs were perfect but someone else at the party got over cooked eggs and when he asked to remake them they were under cooked. It was a hit or miss. 3 out of 4 of us thought the food was just right.Service - waiters are tall and handsome with unidentifiable accents. They add extra flare to the dining experience.Bathroom - not something I usually yelp about... But in this case there was one tiny bathroom for the entire place and I stood in line for a good 20 minutes while one mother occupied it and let her two children in one at a time while taking long breaks to herself in between. I had to go and the wait was frustrating. I wish there was another bathroom.' u"My sister and I visited NYC this week and we were walking around the city and came across this cute restaurant on a Wednesday night. There wasn't anyone inside when we came. Our waiter greeted us and seated us immediately. The decor was very modern and chic. They also have a really cool bar as well. Perfect for any occasion. For appetizer we ordered their daily specials which was an entree it was full of mussels in white wine sauce and with pieces of bread around the plate. It was a great way to start our dinner. For entrees I ordered their Penne Alla San Gennarese. (No clue how to pronounce this dish so I ended up just pointing it out lol!) He also gave me extra parmesan cheese in a little bowl which i thought was kind! I enjoyed this dish very much. I liked how the veggies go well together with the pasta sauce. However I think the pasta itself was a little hard- i prefer mine a little more softer! Overall I would recommend this pasta- it's very filling and also a great choice for vegetarian lovers- without the cheese!My sister ordered their Branzino entree. We could literally smell this dish while they were making it. We knew this is going to be great and it was! This fish was smooth and juicy. I love the vinegar sauce on the side. Everything goes well for this dish. I would recommend this to any fish lovers. We were already satisfied. But I couldn't resist trying our their desserts menu. Our waiter was kind enough to explain the desserts. He explained six different kind of desserts with great details and enthusiasm! Out of all the choices I decided to go with Tiramisu. OMG- This was amazing!! It's very light and soft. Everything just melts in my mouth. We finished this less than 10 seconds. I'm so glad I've made the choice to stay for dessert! The only thing was missing- was just a glass of red wine. Oh and next time order two plates of Tiramisu! One was clearly not enough. Overall we both had an wonderful experience dining at Tartina. Our waiter was friendly and informative. We thanked him for a great dinner and told him we'll be back soon!!" u'Friends of mine came into town for the International Food Festival and one friend said she had met a work colleague at a restaurant on 9th Avenue recently really liked it but could not remember the name of it. She checked her mobile and found out that it was Tartina. It is a small place more of a long hallway-railroad apartment type of space. There are tables in the front and some seating in the back and a bar area for seating. It was brunch time so we all ordered from the menu provided. I got the frittata with sausage and mushrooms and on top of the frittata was a mixed green salad. It was delicious. I got a cup of coffee to round out the meal. My friends ordered the same as I did but one ordered a cappuccino instead. The waiter Alexi was very personable and because my friend had been there recently they kind of knew each other and got to know each other all over again. The food was good it is reasonably priced and I would recommend and return. It is a great place to take people from our of town-you can eat comfortably and are not rushed.' u'Stopped in prior to a Friday evening show. Lovely! The food was wonderful but better yet the service was incredibly fantastic and a special thanks to management \xa0Ambience is great - not too crowded or noisy. I highly recommend this great Italian eatery for a low drama and relaxing meal.' u"Tartina is such a great spot. I go there before Broadway plays almost every time I come in. The food is sooooo good everything on the menu! If you are looking for authentic delicious Italian food then this is the exact spot for you. There is nothing on the menu that is basic---it is all unique delectible and tasty. Youre going to want to try everything they have. The bruscetta sampler is amazing and every one of their pasta dishes is a home run. Gentleman....take your date here you will not regret it. In addition to the food being spectacular the staff is also so kind and attentive even gave us free dessert drinks! This really is my go-to spots whenever I'm around Broadway its awesome." u'Simply lovely. Charming cozy and the food was great. Alexey recommended a very nice wine and every other recommendation he made was spot-on. We will be back!' u"*This review is based on brunch - which was not good at all.I ordered the jam omelette with sausage and fontina cheese. I know what you're thinking. JAM omelette? It sounds weird but for some reason I thought it might be good. You know that whole 'sweet and savory' concept. Sadly I was mistaken. The egg was way overcooked the sausage had this weird leftover taste (probably leftover from the night before) the home fries it came with were bland and a little mushy and the jam came in globs. Let's just say nothing in that omelette worked well together. The best part of the meal was probably that it came with your choice of a mimosa bellini or prosecco.I would come back to try their pasta but I definitely won't be back for brunch." u"We had two fish dishes. Both were delicious especially the orata! Waitress was very friendly and gave us great recommendations. Atmosphere is nice and cozy and hell's kitchen is such a lively area. Will definitely come back!" u'Given the huge tourist influence in the area recently a fantastic find.Excellent lunch experience nice peaceful meal in a more classic Italian style - not the usual NY "Red Italian". Lovely fresh pasta with seafood real luscious tiramisu (of which I am very critical) very good Caprese (but the tomato a little weak of course given it\'s March). All at a realistic cost in a cozy little place with a full bar and very good wine selections. Given the small size I would be cautious at busy dinner times.' u"A group of four of us enjoyed dinner here. We were able to get a same-day reservation for Saturday evening without a problem. Service was attentive and friendly. After one of us ordered a drink with cucumber in it (one of the daily specials) our waiter explained that they were out of cucumber (and apologized) before making a fitting recommendation for another drink. I appreciated that he listened to what we liked then made a rec. instead of just trying to get us to order something expensive or over-stocked.Clean silverware/napkins after each course and complimentary lemon sorbet after our meal were nice treats. Some people on here have complained about the bread. It wasn't anything special but it wasn't hard or dry either. I had the caramelle - according to the menu homemade pasta stuffed with ricotta and mozz. in a butter walnuts and radicchio sauce. It was excellent. I'm not typically a cream sauce person (given the choice I'll gravitate toward a tomato sauce) but this was unquestionably delicious. And so rich! Had I been by myself I would have needed to divide the plate in half when it was served and take half the pasta home for lunch the next day.The calamarata also got raves from our table. They said the calamari were cooked perfectly -- and both people who ordered that dish ate every single bite. No dessert for us everyone was too stuffed! Now to figure out when I can make it back to try the anelli di crespelle..." u'Really a hidden gem. Have been here for dinner 3 times and have never been disappointed. Price point is really good especially for HK (even the wine by the bottle). The wait staff is incredibly knowledgable and friendly. Cannot recommend more highly!' u"Horrible food!The appetizer was way over priced. The calamari was tasteless and poorly put together with slices of cheaply cut oranges.For entree I got a steak. I don't know what cut that was but it looked really bad like it was previously frozen and looked like it was almost steamed than grilled. Had absolutely no color to it and I had to return it. My friend had a fish and that was bland too. Very disappointing" u"I went here with some friends this past weekend and it was just OK. The place was clean but it was incredibly quiet- you could hear a pin drop. There wasn't even any music. We walked in and the only other people in the place was a very quiet couple. It was awkward and we felt we had to try and be quiet the whole time. The food was good & the waiter was attentive. Two of us had the gnocci butternut squash & speck special and that was delicious- big serving. One had the muscles special (she said it was cold) and the other had a ravioli-like dish that was quite small. I enjoyed my gnocci dish but we all agreed we wouldn't return." u'Went to Tartina on Thursday. \xa0We were the only people in the restaurant which made me wary but we live in the neighborhood so we figured we would give it a try. \xa0We were seated next to open windows looking out on to 9th. \xa0We ordered negronis and a charcuterie. \xa0The cured meats were phenomenal and the waiters were very attentive and friendly. \xa0They make their negroni with champagne instead of gin which is weird but they were happy to make the standard gin negroni for me and it was great. \xa0The happy hour deal was unexpected and great and the prices were really reasonable generally. \xa0Not sure why the place was empty but I will be back!' u"Went with a friend on a Saturday noon. I had the spinach and goat cheese omelette which was very generous on the spinach and eggs but seemed a little overcooked. My friend had the smoked salmon with eggs with delicious smoked salmon. We also got an extra serving (though sides don't seem to be listed on the menu.) The brunch/lunch menu is a bit small and the food is not among best I've had - but I would recommend if you are looking for a nice cozy relaxing place with decent food a good price and good service. I would go back."]
22.La Pulperia,[u"Wow wow wow amazing place for Latin fusion food. Found this place using Yelp and my experience it's going outstanding !! Tip- the salmon brule good for appetizer and the pulpo al escabeche. Main course the octopus !I really recommend this place for dinner great music and drinks !Five starts to la pulperia" u"Pros:Good foodCons:Seriously overpricedTINY portion sizeI tried Fish Ribs (Barbequa de pacu) and Seafood platter (Brazilian paqueta). The fish ribs was great but the sea food platter was just decent. However they lose serious points because of how unjustly expensive they are. I could've still dealt with the extra price if they at least gave enough to fill you up. Nope. They served some of the tiniest portion sizes I've seen in any restaurant. This is a small decent restaurant pretending to be an upscale 5 Michelin star restaurant but it's no where near as good as that. I wouldn't come back here if I'm the one paying." u"The Quick: Phenomenal service mixed with delicious seafood and strong drinks earned this spot a coveted five stars. The Details: We almost missed this restaurant as the storefront is very tiny on a congested block restaurant Row near time square. The restaurant is designed to look like the inside of a ship. Makes sense since the seafood is so delicious and fresh it was probably caught that day.The entr\xe9es such as the octopus (amazing) and branzino come with five seasonal sides including eggplant celery root gratin (covered in cheese) and potato salad. The staff was very accommodating to my 'bread free diet' and brought us dipping vegetables for the guacamole at no additional cost. The owner/manager came to our table to make sure we were happy with everything and was extremely entertaining.The Damage: An entr\xe9e each and appetizer to share came to $41 each before tip. We were fully satisfied with the portions and stuffed." u"Well I think I am a little addicted to La Pulperia by now. It's been more than 2 years since I have been enjoying its latin fusion cuisine and spectacular drinks. \xa0It has soared like eagle in terms of popularity and quality of service. This restaurant is an example how an establishment \xa0should be run. This is definitely no fluke Victor and Carlos have worked extremely hard to have La Pulperia \xa0reached new heights.My favorites The guacamole: fresh and with a touch of spicy jalape\xf1os along with home made chips.The Argentinean empanadas: top notch. The papas con chorizo empanada. Nice blend between an Argentinean crust and a Mexican spicy filling. The grilled octopus: Perfectly cooked accompanied with great sides except for the cheesy celery. Just had it yesterday and it's always consistent.La moqueca: fresh coconut saffron rice topped with seafood. A brazilian original taken to to the next level. Do not get me started commenting on the drinks. I am a big fan of Daniel he is the best in midtown to say the least. He is always searching for the next drink that will blow your mind. \xa0In summary this place delivers the best food and service on 46th st so if you want to experience something great before your broadway show head to La Pulperia." u"I've been to La Pulperia a few times now - from a boozy (drag queen) brunch to a random stop in for cocktails. I've always had a good time. The food most seafood of course is very good. The ceviche oysters and steak are my favs. My hubs loves the moqueca (seafood stew). With that being said I mainly come here for the drinks. (There was a brief moment in time when a SNAFU occurred with their liquor license - very sad times). The barten.. I mean.. mixologists here are amazing! I just ask for Mezcal and he makes the magic happen. Last night drinks came with flamed cinnamon sticks thyme and rosemary. Amazing." u"This little restaurant is easy to miss on a street lined with them but it's worth the effort to eat there. It's s little pricey but the food is well prepared well presented and very good. I ordered the grilled octopus my granddaughter had the black pepper spaghetti with seafood and truffle oil. Both were delicious. To start we both had the ceviche which was very fresh citrusy and refreshing. We seemed to be the only tourists there so it's a local place and that's a good thing. Service was attentive and prompt." u'In from out of town. Such amazing food and atmosphere. Came with my sister. It was nice for us to be able to have a personal conversation but also have good people watching. Would totally go back!!! The cocktails were bomb!!!!!!' u'Fantastic place- small underground atmosphere with brick walls and seating for 20-30 people - we had the Brazini whole fish and the paradelli with short ribs which were both amazing. \xa0The octopus starter was good but did not have much octopus. \xa0The empanadas are do die for!!' u'We visited this place on Cinco De Mayo which as you can imagine was a little busy. \xa0We were able to post up at the bar near the entrance. \xa0This place was definitely enjoyable. \xa0The drinks were made well! \xa0We ordered empanadas which were absolutely amazing. \xa0The butternut squash crab and corn/cheese were delicious. \xa0Staff was friendly also!I definitely recommend this place to check out!' u'A really nice non- "theater district restaurant" in the heart of the theater district. The best items we had were the corn and cheese empanadas (highly recommend) and the salmon tartare br\xfbl\xe9e - a very unique flavor. It\'s tough to find something great to eat before a show and la pulperia offers that.' u'So good! Went here with my new wife for a honeymoon dinner and Alejandro and his team took great extra care of us. Will be back next year for our friends wedding!' u"Eating here felt welcoming like having dinner at a friends house. Had to look for the address despite trying to nav my way there so if there's a sign i sure missed it! \xa0I suppose that's part of the charm tho. Super low key restaurant. Small intimate setting w lively music and friendly crowd. Kinda pricey for what it is but a fun experience regardless.I was able to make reservations day-of but there was plenty of room at the bar and seating available at a few tables. I met both the owner and the manager -- both insanely nice and made some recommendations based on what I described my buds were craving and I was fortunate enough to get to try out some unique dishes -- fish ribs and broccolini (had a surprising kick to it!) are MUST gets! \xa0Lobster taco was better than I expected prob great for most but I don't even normally like tacos or lobster :PToo full to try the dessy but it def looked good... yep I was eyeing everybody else's haha. \xa0Next time I'm here I'm gonna bring more people so we can do it family style. \xa0YESSS mmmm" u'Great service and exceptional food. \xa0Definitely get the app sampler. \xa0Totally worth it. \xa0Loved the salmon tartar. \xa0An interesting twist. \xa0The Smoky Room cocktail is delicious!' u"You ever find yourself heading home after a long day of work and suddenly have an undeniable craving for fresh oysters? \xa0Once that thought is planted into your mind it won't go away no matter how hard of a day you had. The only cure a visit to La Pulperia and their happy hour dollar blue point oysters. A nice little restaurant tucked along restaurant row. Laid back decor retro lights and brick stone walls adds to the settle charms of this little hideaway. Large yellow incandescent bulbs bring back a vintage atmosphere to the exposed brick stone walls and the hardwood floorboards. Sitting at the bar you get access to their happy hour menu items that range from the dollar oysters to salmon tacos. Their empanadas and guacamole were also delicious. My fianc\xe9 tried the happy margarita and she enjoyed the drink very much. Not too strong and flavorful at the same time.The manager came by and introduced himself and made small talk. \xa0A very friendly fellow and that goes for the staff as well. Everyone we interacted with was friendly and courteous. \xa0He was nice enough to give us a shot of their sponsored tequila to try. Who can argue with service that gives and gives?Overall the place may be small and not packed to the door with people but sometimes the places with less people makes for a better experience." u"Try the Escampeche de Pulpo. \xa0It's so good it should be illegal. The service was high class the cocktails were a delight and the main courses are something out of a movie. \xa0Dine here with confidence!!!" u'Oh dear god. I love love their take on the salmon tartar. It\'s caramelized with strawberries. Literally.... TO. DIE. FOR. If you\'re someone like me that loves to try different food and have your pallet go on an adventure you just try this. Their fish ribs were also so delicious and fresh. Very "fall of the bone". \xa0The venue is very nice and the location is perfect in HK. I think it may be a little too over priced but if it\'s good food I truly don\'t care.' u"They have a great drink- El Chilango. \xa0I would return over and over for just this.I enjoyed the beef empanadas esp the crust. The cheese one was tasty as well but would prefer beef.We shared the seafood soup which was good. Tacos were small and I wasn't a huge fan.They have a good happy hour menu. I was really surprised to find this place if not for Yelp I don't think I would ever know it existed and i have never walked down that street before (in my 20+yrs of living in NYC). Looks like a bunch of tourist trap restaurants congregated there." u'Great food. Great service. Little congested seating - but honestly dosnt matter you are there for the food! Drinks were great as well.We were late for our reservation but the restaurant was able to accommodate us in no time. Will be back.' u"Great happy hour prices super nice staff and lovely cocktails! The bartender is a total sweetheart and the host made me feel so welcome a rarity in NYC. I would definitely recommend a happy hour since we didn't have dinner but I would definitely come back!" u"The food here is amazing and the show was fun... I love how friendly and nice the staff is... The lobster and ceviche were the highlights of our meal... I have to confess that the drag show at intermezzo is miles better but their food sucks... The food here is just leaps ahead... It's nicely presented as well presentation is everything Intermezzo take notes..."]
200.Pret A Manger,[u"This is by far the best Pret Location I've been to in NYC. \xa0I arrive every morning between 7& 8 and always pleased with how energetic and friendly the staff is. \xa0 I can honestly say the staff especially Charmaine help me start my day off on the right foot and with a smile.What is even more wonderful I practically pick up my lunch there everyday and receive the same level of service. \xa0 \xa0 Did I mention the food is always displayed beautifully and fresh. \xa0 The store is spotless even in their most busier of times." u'We stopped in for a quick breakfast...were in a hurry so grabbed pastry and coffee. \xa0The croissant was delicious. \xa0Quick service plenty of seating and very clean environment' u"This place kind of reminds me of Panera Bread with a menu built for convenience and for the on-the-go person. \xa0Anyways came here for a quick breakfast they serve warm bagels sandwiches and pastries. \xa0Coffee is pretty much serve yourself. \xa0 Pretty good spot for breakfast if you want to burn some time before a morning show at Radio City Music Hall. \xa0 Staff was friendly \xa0quick and effecient.Plenty of locations all over the city so I'm sure you'll run into one soon. FYI: Bathroom code is on your receipt." u"My absolute favorite! Fresh healthy and tasty products and the price is fine. I'll just probably move to any city with a Pret a manger nearby." u'Love love love this place so much! There are so many HEALTHY vegetarian opinions that are full of fresh and nutritious ingredients! The coffee and cheddar and tomato sandwich were nothing but perfection. Will be coming back here x 100 plus Cheers and enjoy' u"I stopped by for coffee and brunch:) It was really good! The chicken & avocado balsamic sandwich was so delicious! It's very clean and staff was really nice." u'Tawny is THE best! Service smile and really knows her organic product options. And her smile was a million dollar one!' u'Food is fresh and delicious!! Easy to pick up a bite and run right out in under ten min. This place is slammed full of people but not too trendy. Made today consumed today. I like it!! Turkey avocado sandwich and Greek yogurt with blackberries and granola YUM!!!' u'What a lovely little cafe! The fresh juices were absolutely delicious and the little "Love Bites" were a big hit for little gifts that I brought back to Houston. The staff was very friendly and the entire cafe was very well kept!' u"I heart this place! \xa0Visiting from out of town felt so good to eat fresh all natural food in perfect portion sizes. We ate here 3x in 5 days. Green good stuff juice bagel soups burritos and protein salads were delish. They also donate all they're remaining food each night to the food bank. Helping others and ensuring customers only buy what's fresh. Bravo. Love." u"If McDonalds actually cared about what it served to nourish people it'd be Pret a Manger. \xa0That is healthy fast yet still lacking flavor soul and character. It's a sad testament to our fast food lifestyle that people get excited by such a small improvement over other fast food. And yet it still merits three stars." u'This was a great place to get breakfast near my hotel. \xa0Things to love: flat white coffee yogurt with pomegranate seeds and honey fresh juice fresh pastry.' u'This place is deceptively good. I didn\'t have high expectations for a "fast food" place but the taste and quality rivals many sit-down places. I\'m not giving this five stars because it is in NYC with so many delicious options but almost anywhere else 5 stars. Reasonably priced too!' u'My every morning stop before office! love the coffee and almond croissants are amazing !Lunch time they have very healthy and fresh options ! The best around this area' u"Pret is a quick spot to literally grab lunch when you're on the go. Sandwiches are packaged in half or whole along with assorted salads. They should bring back the dipped soups versus serving it pre-bowled." u"There is a Pret A Manger at about every single street corner in London so when I found one in New York I was thrilled. It's my favorite place to grab a healthy meal on the go. Very fresh delicious and healthy options. I'd recommend it if you're in a rush or skipped breakfast and want o pick up something healthy." u'Their almond danish is the best around and service is always accurate fast and friendly. \xa0Always a go to for a great cappuccino or a place for an interview or quiet meeting.' u"Ordered a hazelnut latte to try the place out.Didn't have time to try more. Not the best but not the worst. Nothing to complain about! Clean fresh decent and mainly consistent. Good for on the go." u'LOVEEEE EVERYTHING ABOUT PRET !!! This is my favorite location the food is amazing and always fresh!! \xa0love everyone there specially angel hes a sweetheart' u"It's Pret always consistent consistently very good. Self serve sandwiches drinks etc...I've reviewed these around the globe and they all get 5 stars. Always clean and food is always fresh and delicious."]
161.Sticky’s Finger Joint,[u"My love affair with Sticky's began when I visited their first location on 31st street ... Finding out they had opened a 3rd location I was excited since this location is easier for me to visit. In comparison to 31st this location is nicer  this one is bigger & has a more comfortable seating area. Fun decor  love the colorful mural. I've tried my share of the Chicken before this time around I decide to try the Thai fiesta & the Chicken poppers with the vampire aoli & mac sauces. The Thai fiesta fingers were very good  nice big pieces of chicken covered in a sweet Thai sauce this was great. Chicken poppers seem to be new to the menu regular fried pieces of chicken these are meant to be dipped the vampire aoli is very good nice garlic taste  the Mac sauce was interesting at first ? Not bad tho taste like Mac & cheese of course taste good on the chicken. New food additions to this menu sandwiches wraps & salads not bad looking forward to trying then in future visits. Nice location  service was good & prices are not bad depending on what you get." u"I heard good things about this place and the menu was really enticing but honestly I just couldn't eat it.Ordered the buffalo chicken strips and I think the reason why it was so inedible for me is that they just dumped too much sauce on it making it an absolute salt bomb. Like even though I could tell it's quality plump chicken and a crispy breading underneath the sauce just ruined it. And the bleu cheese crumbles on top didn't help either.Then I thought maybe I'll like it better if I'm drunk. So I stashed it in the fridge and tried it the following night after a Thirsty Thursday but nope. Nope nope. I tossed it." u"Good chicken fingers. \xa0They've got a lot of tasty sauces and good chicken and fries. \xa0Chicken and fries seem to be about the only thing they do so don't go in expecting great variety. \xa0Also they are extremely stingy with sauce - you get one small container of sauce and an extra small container is a dollar. \xa0Not great there Sticky's. \xa0But the food is tasty so I'll probably be back at some point." u"There are places that make you wait for hours for delivery ... and there are places like Sticky's where the delivery guy literally shows up like 15 minutes after you put in the order. \xa0Even I was kind of freaked out at how fast the food got to my place. \xa0That alone is worth a five star rating.But let's not forget the food. \xa0Heard about this new outpost near my digs and decided to satisfy my irrational desire for a good chicken sandwich by ordering a spicy chicken sandwich some cajun fries and a side of cabbage. \xa0The cabbage for the record is a total waste of money. \xa0Don't even bother. \xa0But the sandwich and the fries were seriously kick ass.The spicy chicken sandwich was at one point crispy .. but the crazy amount of slaw and hot sauce that was oozing on the sandwich turned it into some kind of Frankenstein's monster. \xa0Only it was a really good monster. \xa0The flavor was outstanding. \xa0If you like light food don't even think about ordering the spicy chicken. \xa0I have a pretty high tolerance for heat but this thing was pretty damn spicy. \xa0I honestly would have stopped eating it if not for the fact it was so tasty. \xa0The cajun fries were a perfect compliment to the awesomeness of the spicy chicken. \xa0It did get a bit salty after a while but honestly it was still worth it.Next time I might take a more conservative approach and order the classic but I still really enjoyed my meal and the ultra fast delivery definitely deserves some serious brownie points!!" u"Pretty good chicken! Very crispy. There are a lot of sauces to choose from.My bf went to get food there and just came back. I was craving chicken and fries as well. So I ordered the signature chicken poppers (that comes with small fries) and he got a regular one with the sauce on the side.Took a star away because I opened the box only to find chicken and no fries... thought maybe it would be at the bottom...nope..bit disappointed. And I don't want to walk all the way there just to get the fries." u"This third location of Sticky's is the largest and best yet with more seating and space including booths.There are also some new menu items exclusive to this location for now. They have wraps which you can fill with grilled chicken or fried chicken but most notably the new Hot Chicken / Szechuan Spicy Fried Chicken is so hot it will make you sweat. If you like spicy make sure you try this.All of the excellent original stuff is here too like the sandwiches the specialty fingers and the amazing fries in all varieties. Definitely get the Bacon Mac Fries and don't scoff at the S'mores Fries as they're actually an excellent combo. Anything really goes well though with the fries here which are perfectly crispy and salty." u"Oh ya I luck out walking down 9th Avenue looking for new food spot for me to check out and I 'm there when Stinky's Fingers opens up for the first day in there new restaurant. \xa0 at 4:00 PM and I got there 6:30 PM I waited on a line that went around the block until I could order after 45 minutes.I got the crunchy Chicken Finger Basket and Fries to go since all the tables were taken. \xa0They have about 8 tables with 20 seats. I nibble on my food on the way home. \xa0It was good tasting chicken not (sticky?) I didn't know at the time since I was new to Sticky's that they have a dozen sauces to add to your chicken and one is called Sticky another is called Vampire?Oh and I love the flavor of the coating on the chicken and the meat was not dry. The fries where also good it you look close at them you can see the flaky outer crust on the potato I don't know how they get it that way. I got the plan classic fries but you can get Cajun or something called pop pie fries. They forgot to give me ketchup or ran out Oh how I wish I could have sat down to enjoy it.Maybe No of course I will go again to try and get more chicken with some of the sauces like Vampire Aioli Green Tea Caesar or Wasabi. And some of the other items on the menu soon like Popers and the \xa0Salted Caramel Pretzel. Today's first day was just to crazy to think of options because they had $1 baskets of chicken fingers and poppers between 4 and 7pm but I got to the counter at 7:15 ;-(" u'R. is in the building.i have long avoided Sticky\'s for fear of ruining the key element of any birthday boy diet: chicken fingers. the other elements of a birthday boy diet are obviously...SPOILER ALERT...ice cream cake and soda. duh.the digs themselves. clean. shiny. colorful. there are seating options flush right as you enter. a couple of booths and smaller tables. on the left there is a table inset to the wall for those who prefer to stand aka standing room only. haha. straight ahead to the back is where you order. most options are pretty straight forward. the space itself feels big even though square footage puts it more at a medium-ish size. amazed at despite the junky eats...how clean the space was. PRO TIP: you can get the chicken fingers fried or grilled. get them fried. grilled chicken fingers are WEAAAAAK like your dad\'s game...which is why he ended up with your momzzzz. lolthe fingers? the chi\'k\'n be magnificent. crispy crunch outside. flavorful chicken meat on the inside. the vampire killer aioli sauce --thick creamy spiced right...perfection. you get one complimentary sauce with each fingers order...outside of ketchup...which they have a treasure chest of. you can ask to sample before choosing one. definitely want to try buttermilk baby ranch cray sauce \xa0and wasabi aioli next time. there about 20 different sauces!PRO TIP: three fingers is enough for 1 person. the LARGE = five fingers...great for two to share and you get two sauces!all chicken finger baskets come with fries. i opted for the bacon cheese fries. glorious to the eye. smelled great. i would say it\'s a tad on the salty side actually it\'s pretty salty. maybe it was the combo of eating the fingers and these fries...but the fries seemed over salted--and add the the saltiness from the cheese sauce and bacon...and you have a sodium bomb. they were still pretty edible but i couldn\'t finish them. if you order them ask to ease up on the seasoning and you should be fine. \xa0curious to try the pot pie fries next!the rest of the sides are different variations of the fries...or not real veggies like slaw or pickles. loloutside of chicken fingers you can get poppers chicken sandwiches made up of the chicken fingers or salads with chicken fingers. and you can get wraps as well. drinks: soda Boyle\'s soda & water...water or a can will run you almost two bucks. lame. they do have Black Cherry Boyle\'s soda...but that\'s even more than 2 bucks.PRO TIP: bring your own water or drank. the staff: cool quick hardworking. not very chatty. but they keep the place sparkling and moving like a well-oiled machine...so no complaints there.ANECDOTE: as i was eating a woman with a walker/cane--about 30+ years of age but looked more like 50+ bc she\'s been ravaged by obesity and the aging effects of fast food--stood waiting for a table but no one was getting up. since i have done no good deeds in 2016 i decided to give my table up ...so said lady could eat. hitting ::PAUSE BUTTON:: a table away was a dude who obviously worked for STICKEY\'S who was obnoxiously cackling into his iphone earbuds\' mic while he slapped away at a PC (probably an IBM thinkpad--who uses that weak PCtech). the guy was probably a manager/pr person/"consultant" etc. who doesn\'t do any work at the location but takes up a table to mindlessly ramble over the phone out loud. the woman who needed a table was in clear view of him. however this human form of STAPH infection continued to giggle aloud and probably play World of Warcraft and not give up the table. ::UNPAUSE:: it was fairly clear that i was cutting my meal short but i decided to do the "right thing" and get up & give up my table. as soon as i got up the woman hit turbo boost (farted probably ) and whooshed over faster than a electric wheelchair with nitro and sat down. she didn\'t even say THANK YOU \xa0or anything! what a goddamn TURD. serves me right for doing the right thing. point of the story. take your food from Sticky\'s and eat anywhere but there bc this is the type of customer you\'ll be sitting next to: 250 lbs of mushy turd/ette/s overstuffed into a 100 lbs. bag who has a Super Cuts haircut and bad dye job. or you\'ll be forced to listen to the inanity of one of their "suits" who\'s probably being \xa0CATFISHED by some dude in Riker\'s. i have pics not posting of both trainwreckages of humanity...not to protect the innocent...but to protect your eyes from gratuitous grossness X 2. regardless of the anecdote the food here is good. fries be salty. the digs be clean. staff are great.the cost: chikn $7-$8 + bacon cheese fries $5-$6 + Boyles sida (delicious) $3-$4 + tax equals lots of delicious at a high cost for fast casual food. drops mic bc chicken fingers take priority over emceeing!i out.zzz' u"Really liked it here! It decorations inside were super cute people there were really nice too!! The food was good loved the Thai sweet chili and the sticky's sauce! Can't wait to try other sauces!! (The sauce comes with the chicken basket but if you buy the sauce individually it's around a dollar I think! )" u'what is this new world that has been opened up before methe salted caramel pretzel signature is my new favorite' u"Dropped by for their grand opening promo: selling baskets of their classic Fingers OR Poppers for $1. 4:15pm line wasn't too ridiculous despite the blog press and the staff handled it well albeit with a number of hiccups with confusing who ordered what. The Buffalo Balsamic Maple sauce however was just buffalo and thus a huge disappointment* but the fries and chicken were solid. This outpost is their first to serve alcohol and the decor is pretty great street art-style murals.*We'll see how they react given their history of social media impropriety." u'My child wanted wings for his 12th birthday dinner. \xa0We could walk here from the hotel so we gave it a try. \xa0He enjoyed the wings! \xa0I tried one of the wrap sandwiches with grilled chicken. \xa0If you get this tell them only a bit of sauce. \xa0I was literally squeezing my sandwich and letting the sauce pour onto my plate. \xa0It was ridiculously covered and not in a good way. \xa0The people working the counter were nice and friendly. \xa0They do have a bathroom so you can wash your sticky fingers when done. \xa0The wall is painted in a cool artsy way (see photo).' u"Okay after a crazy day of running around there's nothing quite like some comfort food to wind down. \xa0The restaurant itself its is industrial with some cool art on the walls but clean and kind of simple. The food although yes it is fast and fried its pretty good. \xa0This is no dieters place your defiantly packing a high calorie meal here but man is it good. \xa0I love spicy food so I tried the Basket Buffalo Blue Crunchy it comes with fries. \xa0The flavor is really amazing I chose the smallest size but its a huge portion I couldn't finish all of it. \xa0This place is my new guilty pleasure." u"Best chicken fingers I've ever had. \xa0They use fresh chicken and you can really taste the difference. \xa0Their sauce is also pretty special and worth the extra dollar they charge for it." u"Sticky's newest location!! I am so glad they opened up in Hell's Kitchen. The other two locations were too far for me.. Much bigger than their other two locations with fun murals stretched out on their wall. Only at this location you will be able to try their wraps you can get with either grilled or fried chicken. Not a huge wrap fan but theirs was delicious and especially with the sauce they put in. You must also try their new Southern/Szechuan style chicken. So hot & spicy it was perfect for me. Great food and friendly staff!" u"We are visiting NYC and I found this place on Facebook via Insider page.. It's like 15 mins walk away from times square. Came here monday afternoon and this place is very neat and clean good ambiance and a lot of friendly staffs.. Especially the bearded guy with cap.. He's very nice and very accommodating! He even gave us a sample when I told him that it was our first time there. Hope the management give him incentives for his hardwork. ^_^ Probably it would be the last time (for now) to visit this place because we are from SF. :( But if you are in nearby area dont hesitate to try this place! Especially the thai fiesta! Bomb!" u"I had been watching for the opening of Sticky's Finger Joint and when I passed by the other day I realized it was already in full swing. I got a copy of the take out menu just to see what was available and to make an educated choice when I got to the counter. After perusing the menu I decided to get the poppers [no fries] and i was entitled to one sauce so i got the sassy BBQ. I was hungry but not that hungry and I didn't realize how much food i would be getting. It was delicious. The staff was accommodating and the food came quickly. It is a fairly small place but there is adequate seating and there is also a counter along one wall. i would recommend and return." u'I walked by when the first opened and saw a line outside the door so I had to give it a try. I order the chicken fingers and fries with a traditional BBQ sauce. The chicken tenders were a great size moist and juicy. I would go back' u'The chicken fingers are all white meat and pretty thick. Lots of sauces to choose from I tried the vampire aioli barbecue chipotle mayo sweet chili and sticky sauce which were all good. My preference is the vampire aioli but there are tons more to choose from.' u'The fried food is great. The prices are a little expensive for the fast food vibe but I have never had a bad experience.']
64.Tacuba Hell’s Kitchen Cantina Mexicana,[u"Good vides very open loud but was good for our group of 5. Main down sides were the delay getting food it was all delicious but it took a while (40+ Mins). Marg's: Too sweet but I'm also not a big Marg fan. Dishes: - Spicy Kale was great not too much spice. - Chips & guac and avocado fries were perfect.- Had the Pollo Tacos nothing too special." u"Torn on this one - I wanted to love this place. \xa0It's big it's unique looking and I love mexican food.I came for lunch and got three vegetarian tacos (which were great but comically TINY.) \xa0They were $13 and came with rice and beans which is really not bad - BUT - the dinner menu seems to suggest that the same tacos are a few dollars more and don't come with rice and beans. \xa0That would really irk me - as again as I and every person mentioned these are really small tacos. \xa0 Like the smallest i've ever seen. \xa0Also I asked if there are chips and salsa and the waitress said they are $3. \xa0I know $3 isn't bad but i don't think i have ever been to a mexican place that didn't offer chips and salsa for free. \xa0Between getting charged for that and the small portions \xa0- i just felt like i was getting hosed. \xa0When the dessert menu came around i honestly just assumed i'd be disappointed by the portion size and opted to leave and pick up a dessert elsewhere. The food really was good - but something about the place made me feel like i was being ripped off." u"Oh Tacuba you are an expensive taco joint. Service decor layout food are all good but damn it's expensive for a tiny taco. We came to dine during the night with the crazy thunderstorm and glad we got a comfortable corner seat.Guacamole - Started off with guacamole which was really good! They give you a side of salsa which was just OK but go for the guac of course. The chips were nice and warm...that's the best!Brisket tacos - I highly recommend getting the brisket beef tacos. SO GOOD. Very delicious the flavor is on point and good chunks of meat. The green sauce really compliments it well. Just sucks that the tacos are so TINY. Chicken tacos - these were OK. Not bad but if I had to choose I would rather go brisket! The combination of the chicken and salsa on top was good but I can't get over how small they were for that price!Carnitas - these were delightful...if you like pork and you like a bit of crunch with a side of vegetables this is the dish for you. It comes on a sizzling plate of pork on the bottom crispy pork skin guacamole and greens to top it off. You get six hot soft taco shells to build your own meal. Again tiny taco but the filling was great. Fried avocado - this was just OK. I would pass. All in all three main dishes with an appetizer side and drink came out to about $100. Would I do it again? Probably not but it was a good experience." u"Of all the Mexican restaurants in hell's kitchen Tacuba is definitely a standout. One of the best in the area by far! The food here is excellent the ambiance great and the service top notch. We came here on a Friday night and easily got a last minute reservation for four. First thing we noticed is how big bright and airy the space is. The walls and bar are nicely decorated with Mexican knick knacks like painted ceramic skulls cacti and tequila bottles. Gives a very cool rustic sort of vibe. To drink we got a pitcher of the La Sandia and a Pina Para la Nina in a pineapple. The Sandia was refreshing and strong with watermelon bits in it The pina was good with a strong pineapple flavor. For the food we got the grasshopper and the octopus-chorizo tacos. The grasshopper was very well done and the octopus-chorizo was good too. We also got the Japones ceviche which was delicious! It had a nice peanut-soy sauce-citrus flavor to it definitely a unique blend of ideas. We also got the duck enchiladas which were perfect. The duck filling is smoky with a hint of sweetness and the enchilada sauce was light and flavorful not the tomatoey cheesy mess you typically get in most tex mex places.I later found out that this is a Julian Medina establishment and being huge fans of Toloache I'm not surprised we loved the food here so much. A must try for sure!" u"This restaurant is so cute!!!! Love all the atmosphere the decor and wow the patio area is perfect! Super friendly great service! Water was always filled. One of the other table had some kids and the staff was super sweet and friendly with the kids. Even wore a picture they made for her the whole time we were there! Such a sweet gesture! They have a huge bar area with ever tequila you could think of! And a great drink menu! I got the \xa0pepinada margarita. It was refreshing though wish had a bit more flavor and spice!Loved the guacamole came with different spice levels. We got spicy and it was super yummy! The chips were great too. Wasn't a huge fan of the salsa reminded me of a cold soup! Got the carne asada tacos delicious!!! Small portion but I felt full after eating it! The chips and guacamole probably helped!!!  I really enjoyed our lunch here!!!" u"The Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood are hit and miss...and the location of this new one is cursed but I think it just might make it!Came here for dinner on a Thursday night and really enjoyed the atmosphere the service and the food. \xa0 The plates are small and made for sharing and the prices may seem a little high but ordering guac the carnitas and the suadero tacos provided enough food for me and my mate. \xa0 \xa0I also had a margarita which was nice but small.The tacos were delicious...the brisket meat was flavorful and tender. \xa0The guac was really really good. I can't say why it was such a treat but I really liked it. \xa0The carnitas was good too maybe a little greasy in spots but there was nothing left in the pan when we were finished!This is a nice alternative to El Centro (which I love) and Arriba Arriba (which I like a lot). \xa0I would say the food and vibe here are a little more upscale than those places." u"Everything was top notch just wish the portions were a little bigger! :P Very cute interior perfect for a date or fun friends get-together. I was so lucky to have been surprised by my friends here for my birthday and we all had such a great time! The staff were so accommodating so I'd like to say an extra thanks to them! :) GET THE AVOCADO FRIES!!!!Mojitos were delicious! Can't go wrong with any of the tacos. Prices are a little steep but I guess what can you expect from Mexican food in NY. I will be back!!" u"Lots of Mexican options on this stretch of the city so it's hard to stand out. Tacuba comes in with a rustic decor and open atmosphere.Fairly busy on July 4th day but secured a table for 2 near the window. Had to start the with the Guacamole ($12) - a medium sized bowl filled with creamy avocado goodness served with a plethora of chips. For the meal ordered the Carnitas ($22) and a sangria ($10). Carnitas comes out as a giant roast pork dish in a bowl cooked crispy with lots of oil/fat in the bottom. A little greasy yet excellent flavor. You roll it up in the provided tortillas and add a dollop of guac and some sauces perfect. Sangria is okay has some odd juice inside that tasted a bit syrupy.Service here is super friendly and the food came out fairly quickly. Prices are higher than I'd like to spend on this type of food so try to get things you normally don't find in other similar spots. Will try to come back for brunch." u'I had been waiting for this restaurant to open but when i wanted to eat there there was always something else going on and they did not open until 5P at that time. I went for lunch the other day and the choices are extensive. There is something for the table-guacamole various taco plates and sides ceviches entrees as well as margaritas wines cocktails tequilas and selections of beers. i was seated immediately and was hungry but not too hungry-i ordered a margarita de la casa [regular margarita with salt] it was great-i then ordered the pulpo y chorizo tacos [i thought they were regular sized tacos but they were actually appetizer sized] They were extraordinary-so good that I ordered a second plate. The margarita finished things off and it was a great meal. I would recommend and return.' u"Stopped by here for cinco de mayo or as I would like to call it cinco de drinko They have a nice cocktail menu with a variety or margaritas. We got the pineapple margarita for two served in an actual pineapple with chunks of pineapple floating in the drink. Delicious! \xa0The tacos are very small so get them as an app or get tow orders for an entre. I had the brisket tacos. The meat was very tender and there was a lot of flavor and a nice kick.I got the duck enchilada because thought it was unique but I want very impressed. There wasn't. A lot of flavor and it had a hint of sweetness I wasn't expecting. I had to ask for a side of hot sauceWe also got the ceviche with ginger and peanuts. The tuna tasted fresh and it had lots of flavorWe ended with the churros which were just meh. They weren't crispy enough and the sauce was too thin. I expected much much better from a Mexican restaurant." u'Bold bright Flavors mark this new Julian Medina restaurant. He opened his cantina on what\'s becoming "little Mexico" on 9th.Ave. There are 5 Mexican restaurants in a five block radius.The space is urban tropical comphy chairs with a lovely skylight and a pretty patio in rear.Food wise: Small plates style Ate:Chile relleno w/ quinoa kale & mushroomsShrimp lobster ceviche Guac.$40The relleno was loaded with taste surrounded by a rich red sauce & melted cortija. The guac had that fresh made taste with crunchy onions. The ceviche with lobster- ridiculous! Btw- excellent accommodating hospitable service!' u'Huge fan. I have eaten there twice and just loved every bite. The portions are small but I tend too eat too much so I can deal with it. The ambience is perfect... the patio is small but reminded me of my time in Mexico. I thought everything tasted to perfection I am going to go back to try every dish. TWICE!' u"Nice place cute look food tastes good but portions are super super small!!! I don't really ever post bad reviews but this was shocking really!Green leaves and some jicama one sliver avocado... That's not a salad." u"I've visited this place twice and unfortunately won't be returning. Our first experience was a much more friendly and attentive waiter this second time she barely came to the table and we ended up leaving after eating without our second drink delivered since she didn't bother to ever bring it. The food is very good but portion size is extremely small no sides on any dishes and the price is high for the type of setup. Hell's Kitchen has come to be my least favorite place to grab food and this restaurant is one of the reasons." u"Tacuba looks like it's related to Toloache. \xa0We dropped by here for brunch with our baby and dog (he stayed outside since we snagged a table by the open door). \xa0The food is a bit on the pricey side but it's expected given the decor and style of the restaurant. \xa0I ordered tacos and they were a bit on the small side but it was more authentic and not Tex-mex (Not covered with cheese and sour cream etc.). The food was good.Overall a good experience." u'A great new brunch spot in HK. We went here before seeing a play on Broadway.The tacos were well put together and goodAs were the appetizers' u'The far more reasonable less annoying and better looking Toloache. \xa0Also to mention the food is on point from the spicy guac to the brisket tacos. \xa0I had 3 margaritas at lunch and could have easily had 3 more. \xa0Our service was awesome (thank you Ernesto) and the back patio is a gem.' u'Sorry Tacuba but you\'ve got a long way to go before winning me over. \xa0To start the decor is really cute. \xa0I\'ve seen this restaurant go through many transformations (Agua Dulce Pier 9 etc.) and each concept the interior is done to the nines. \xa0Tacuba definitely shined here. \xa0Where they are lackluster is the service. \xa0My god the service. \xa0I know this restaurant is fairly new and I would generally give them slack but given the owner manages another location I would think they would hire servers who know how to handle being in the "weeds." \xa0Actually the restaurant wasn\'t even that busy when we were there. \xa0However we experienced significant wait times from being greeted to getting drinks to asking for more chips (which were forgotten and had to ask again) to getting the check. \xa0Almost every time I had to flag the server down. \xa0He never stopped by to check in unless I prompted him over even if we were sitting with empty drinks. \xa0He was very friendly when I did get his attention but there was nothing proactive about the service we received.A couple was sat a few tables down from us that ended up getting up and leaving b/c they were never greeted and water was never poured even after 10 minutes.The food was fine. \xa0Nothing to write home about. \xa0Our guacamole had absolutely no flavor and was served so chunky that we had to mash it up ourselves. \xa0The first basket of chips was the bottom of the barrel made up of small crumbs. \xa0We asked for another basket but it took over 10 minutes to arrive only because we asked a busboy walking by (the server had forgotten). \xa0The tacos were really good but you really need to order two orders as a meal. \xa0My friend\'s relleno was very enjoyable and the portion size was adequate for a meal. \xa0The drinks were a waste; literally just juice/mixer. \xa0I ended up switching over to beer as $11 for just mixer can\'t be justified in my book. \xa0My friend\'s and I don\'t hold back when it comes to alcohol. \xa0We decided to relocate after dinner if that\'s any indication...Out of the restaurant\'s control we were seated in the lovebird section of the restaurant. \xa0The table next to us got cozy enough to take their shoes off (gross!!) and start groping one another (7pm on a Monday) and then there was another couple patting each other next to them. \xa0I didn\'t know we visited on Valentine\'s Day. \xa0LOL' u'Absolutely loved the vibe and the cocktails and the food! High-ish prices but worth it for a night out!Pilar was the best!!' u"This place was awesome!! Best service I've ever received. \xa0Food was great and sangria too!!"]
58.La Masseria,[u'This is a great restaurant in the heart of Times Square.The price is definitely higher than average but location the restaurant itself and the most important thing the food are all amazing.The food design was fantastic and not only it was perfectly designed it was tasting fresh with the highest quality.The only downside for us was the waiter who seemed not having a good day and did not give us that welcoming face/service; I cannot rate them lower than 5 just because of this as everything else was 100% perfect.I will definitely go back and totally recommend this place.' u"Very pretty venueVery pricey though. If you go here you must get the breaded zucchini \xa0($11) it is absolutely amazing one of the best things Ive ever got at a restaurant! It's like healthy classy french fries... you can't get enough.Do not get the ($15) broccoli entree it was DRENCHED in oil not even good tasting. Took one bite and didn't touch it after that. The stuffed mozzarella was okay wasn't big on the prosciutto in it. Overall a very nice restaurant." u'Middling Italian food that is slightly overpriced. The food and the service are good but it is tough to justify paying top of the line prices for what you get. For an appetizer I got the buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto. It was good but nothing to write home about. The same could be said for the black pasta seafood special that I got. I feel like I maybe should have gone with one of their more known dishes such as the gnocchi or the ravioli. I feel like I order one of these if I end up coming back.Not a bad spot for Italian if you are in Midtown but I would also recommend checking out Carbone and Il Mulino to compare. As with most restaurants I think the dishes you order can color your experience.' u'Visiting New York from the west and wanted good traditional Italian. \xa0This place definitely satisfied those cravings. \xa0The service was amazing. \xa0The hostess was very friendly and the wait staff was very attentive and knowledgable about the menu. \xa0As far as the food the mozzarella buratta appetizer we ordered was fantastic. \xa0The cheese was so fresh and bleeding insouciantly off the plate. \xa0The gnocchi I order for my main course was probably the best I have ever had. \xa0My mom got a spaghetti special which was fresh and full of delicious shrimp. \xa0The menu was well laid out and provided the diner with a range of different priced items some more expensive and some less. \xa0I would happily dine here again.' u"The prices posted are a lie by half . I hate that.....The rigatoni w grandma sauce is $27 not $19. Do they think they will get more traffic by lying?I would have come if it was $35 but I hate posting bold face prices that aren't close..." u"Delicious and the service is fabulous. I'm still fullfrom dinner and I want to go again." u'Went here for a romantic dinner Saturday. \xa0Made reservations through Open Table and were seated promptly and on time. \xa0Tables are close together but well laid out. \xa0Waiter hit the sweet spot with being attentive but not intrusive. \xa0Extensive wine list with some reasonable options up to however much you want to spend. \xa0We skipped appetizers and had a chicken sausage dish in a red wine sauce and a bacon mozzarella salad. \xa0Both were very good. Well flavored without being overwhelming. \xa0Topped it off with creme br\xfbl\xe9e and grappa for dessert. \xa0Wonderful evening.' u"I came here with my boyfriend during Restaurant Week and we had a great time! This place is great for a date night.Food: For our appetizer we ordered the Mozzarella Farcita Dello Chef which was delicious. Top notch. For our entrees we had the Battuta Di Pollo Alla Griglia Con Porri Brasati and the Sea Bass (I don't think this is on the normal menu maybe only on the Restaurant Week menu or the specials). My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken (Battuta Di Pollo) although it wasn't the best chicken he'd had. My sea bass was better than his chicken - we both agreed. My fish was tender and seasoned well - but not too noldly. Very well cooked. Service: The service was good - our waiter was friendly and accommodating. His accent was a little bit difficult to understand at times but he was still wonderful. He was able to recommend a bottle of wine that paired super well with our food - we both enjoyed tremendously. Definitely ask for wine recommendations with your food selections. Other than that the service wasn't suuuper quick but definitely kind accommodating and likeable. Ambiance: B+The ambiance was romantic and intimate. I would definitely recommend for a date night. Everything was very authentically Italian (at least in my perspective) and not too mainstream and it was great. The lighting was just right - not too dark that I couldn't see but not too bright that it didn't feel romantic. The wait staff was also subtle so that it didn't ruin the mood. The d\xe9cor was Italian/European in style so it was in line with the theme. It was all pretty good. Tldr; we enjoyed our visit here and may come back again. The food was good and the ambiance great :)" u"Decent Italian cuisine made in the Puglia style. Apparently the restaurants name means working farm and their cuisine features interesting additions such as lentils in the olive oil. My friend didn't like this addition but I enjoyed the change.We also enjoyed the fritto misto del mare which is basically a bunch of friends stuff (calamari so good scallops yum! and shrimps which my dinner buddy enjoyed immensely).She also enjoyed a spaghetti with tomato sauce that had large shrimp. I had the gnocchi which was good but could have been a little more cheesy.Overall a solid meal for this area without costing too much dinero." u"Because there are a countless number of Italian restaurants in Manhattan one may overlook this one since it seems rather small from the outside given its humble appearance. However once you walk in you'll find that it's fairly spacious and spans a good length from the front to the back of the establishment. The lighting and vibe in here is wonderful it's very classy and elegant which is probably why the crowd tends to be more on the older side. Definitely not a jeans and tee environment. I had such a great dining experience at La Masseria. My friend and I were greeted warmly by the hostess and reservations are easily done online. We were seated right away and were given the menu promptly. I ordered the sea bass with mashed potatoes and clams from their restaurant week menu and it was amazing! The sea bass was cooked to perfection and same goes for the clams. My friend ordered the gnocchi and that was so flavorful that I wished I had ordered that instead lol. Service was impeccable. The waiters were so friendly and polite. They were attentive throughout the whole meal and my water glass was never empty. They were also extremely helpful and patient when we asked about certain entrees and what they would recommend. When waiters exhibit such great personality it really makes customers enjoy their meals even more. It makes me so happy to see that there are waiters who genuinely care about your dining experience and do everything to the best of their ability to ensure you have an enjoyable meal. I'll definitely be coming back!" u'Everything was exquisite. The ambience. The service team. The grissini. The cocktails. Every dish. Especially the seafood: seared scallop and artichoke appetizer lobster homemade pasta and whole branzino with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Perfect pacing. Got us out well in advance of our show but made us feel welcome and relaxed the whole time.' u'Food was ok. I called and asked if they served single portions prior to waking all over to get here with my daughter. Also asked if they were "kid" friendly prior to heading over. They do serve single potions - at family style prices. No child menu - which to a mother equals NOT kid friendly - and also told us we needed reservations prior to arriving. I sat at the bar with my daughter had an over priced appetizer - and am now leaving.Probably good before a play - but that\'s about all I would come for. Other much better venues in the area.' u"Justin our waiter for the evening made this a great and memorable experience for us before heading over to see Larry David's play. \xa0We were lucky to be seated up stairs where it is more quite and you feel as if you have your own little part of the restaurant to yourself. \xa0The food was very good and quite reasonable given the location and nice decor. \xa0The lobster pasta dish was very good and the service even better. \xa0They are quite aware if you have a show to attend and will see that there are no delays caused by the restaurant. \xa0I'm sure that comes from many years of experience in this Times Square location. \xa0This is a great choice for that pre-theatrical performance dinner. \xa0Call for reservations!" u"We were visiting from Boston and went here for my friend's birthday; we were a group of 8 very needy customers and honestly their service is AMAZING!! Such friendly staff also for my friend's birthday song they literally had a whole choir going! And of course their food is also as amazing. I highly recommend this place." u"Went there yesterday for my wife's Birthday. We had 5 o'clock reservations As we were on our way to see Fiddler on the roof on BroadwayWe were seated promptly. \xa0Nice Decor we sat at a large round table that seated 6 comfortably. The food was very good indeed I ordered BOCCONCINI DI POLLO AL VIN COTTO FUNGHI E SALSICCIAChunks of boneless chicken with mushrooms & sausage in a red wine and shallots sauce. It was excellent. I had some of my wife's pasta which was also very good. The deserts were delicious Highly recommend the cheese cake! \xa0Last note the service was very good. \xa0Would definitely go back. \xa05 stars." u"Wonderful dining experience! The place itself is gorgeous and very spacious. They were able to accommodate our large group with no fuss whatsoever. The servers were attentive and very courteous the wine was delicious and the food was reminiscent of Italy itself. I tried their cavatelli as well as the brazino and both were delectable. Would love to go back for their gnocchi and desserts! If you're looking for a nice meal and attentive staff in the theater district I would highly recommend." u'Excellent experience. \xa0La Masseria serves delicious food in a relaxed atmosphere with excellent service. \xa0This was the first time we had dined there. \xa0My wife and sister both had the orecchiette with broccoli rabe and Italian sausage and I had the gnocchi. \xa0We shared a special mozzarella appetizer and also split the Masseria salad. \xa0Everything was perfectly prepared and delicious. \xa0Service was professional and attentive. \xa0We were seated inside but only a table away from the open front of the restaurant - a perfect location.' u'Wonderful ambience - and unexpected in the theater district. The house made mozzarella with egg plant and peppers - wow! Had the the pasta with Grandmother sauce -- tender beef meatballs in a red sauce that has simmered for hours was amazing. Service was exceptional- attentive and friendly. Got to practice my Italian - really cool.' u"Think I found my new fave Italian restaurant in midtown west! \xa0LOVE the outdoor patio charming interior fabulous service and mar of all the delicious fare! \xa0Grilled lobster app is amazing and Tuna steak special was delish! \xa0I'll be back!" u'Cosy authentic Italian restaurant. The menu is not overly long but covers everything you might want and they have a substantial specials list. We were a group of 6 and chose a Wilde variety from fish to veal to rabbit. I think the rabbit was amazing & the best I have had. The meat portion was filling and came with a small portion of spinach & potatoes but I was full after that!Staff were friendly & attentive. Great location too ideal for pre or post show meal.']
35.Brickyard Gastropub,[u'I was in NYC for the day and we wanted a casual restaurant with reasonably priced food with some great craft beer options and this is what we decided on and we made a good choice. We were able to be seated right away and had a few seating options. To eat we got Frickles as an app (Fried Pickles) Fish & Chips and Steak Frites. We finished it off with a beer flight (4 small pours). They have a pretty good selection of beer from different breweries and states.The Frickles were yummy but be patient before you bite into them! Unless you want to burn your mouth like I did haha. The Steak Frites were good. It was steak on 4 skewers and the frites were white truffle oil and parmesan shoestring potatoes. As for the Fish & Chips they were your standard fish and chips. I ate it all but there was nothing exceptional about it. The "chips" with this was house fries which I liked better than the frites. As for the inside of Brickyard it was nice and all of the exposed brick fit in with the name of the restaurant. Go figure!The only thing that was a little annoying was that the service from our waitress was a little slow. Besides that I am glad we decided to eat here for dinner and found this place. It ended up being exactly what we were looking for.' u'I ordered the duck confit salad philly cheesesteak spring roll and BYOB (build your own burger) with beef caramelized onions goat cheese and garlic aoili (i honestly think they forgot the garlic aioli) with truffle fries. The only dish that set this restaurant apart from other restaurants was the duck confit salad. Duck was very crispy and the salt from the duck mixed with the sweetness from the marinated dates was great. I think they were a little stingy on the asparagus though...Truffle fries were also worth the extra $3. They were very crispy and well seasoned.' u'Excellent food good value and great atmosphere. Strongly recommend the maki maki it comes with an amazing side of delicious spicy potato. Would definitely recommend and will be back again!' u"It's 2.5 for me but just can't bring myself to round up.Been twice now once sitting at the bar once at a table Both times service wasn't great. This last time our waiter was downright pretty bad. Not bad guy it seemed just not a good server. We barely saw him things took forever and he was screwing around chatting with the bartenders and other staff. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip they dropped it off no plates no silverware no napkins. We waited around and I saw the hostess bring plates and silverware to an empty table to set it up I asked her if we could have those. She went and got us waters that we never got from the server (my wife wasn't drinking so she just wanted water). I wanted a 2nd beer and I eventually got it.I ordered a burger with goat cheese and sauteed onions. It was OK nothing spectacular plenty of goat cheese which is good. My wife got a chicken sandwich somehow the waiter gave her truffle fries she never said or ordered that. We thought the kitchen messed up so we just went with it. Well we did get charged the $3 she ate them so we didn't argue but overall that kinda stuff bothers me. She didn't like her sandwich at all she said the chicken was dry and overcooked she didn't finish it.Again my burger was meh the spinach dip was also meh definitely not enough pita with it. They do have some good beers on tap and bottles and the hostess was nice. Overall though meh I've definitely experienced better and I wouldn't come back." u'Sports Bar / Restaurant with Great food and ServiceThis sports bar & restaurant is a perfect spot to watch the game with tv all around as you walk in by the bar area and all seated tables in the back to still get great american fare without the being in the bar atmosphere.We were able to get a table right by the bar and were watching some playoff hockey (Go Islanders!) and order drinks and the waiter got them to us really quickly. I got some moscow mules which were delicious. For food we got frickles - fried pickles glazed buffalo and honey bbq wings chipotle pulled pork sliders and lamb chili smothered tots. All of which was delicious and perfect pub food to have while watching a game. The lamb as a meat topping was something different and that i do not see at a typical pub and they make their food taste awesome.In short they have great drinks food and service!' u"Great experience this evening at this restaurant with my mother and mother-in-law (who are friends). Both are VERY picky eaters and don't like drinking that much (I know right?!). I had to pick a place that would meet their needs but not bore me. Brickyard really came through!What made this experience so special was the attentive polite service. Really excellent job here. \xa0 The waiter and bus persons were attentive with water refills cleaning the table etc. My mom didn't like her tea (no judgements please!) and the waiter took it away without any comment or awkwardness. My mother-in-law and I each had a burger and my ma had fish. All of us really enjoyed our food.Burgers start at $13 ang that include fries or a salad. Cheese bacon avocado specialty sauces etc run you $0.50-$2 each. There are a robust variety of cheeses and toppings. All of which were great. The salad was not overly dressed with a house vinaigrette. I ate every bite.They had $5 beer and wine for Happy Hour 5-8 but that's only at the bar not tables. Know before you go. Five stars for a delicious meal and really great service that made us very comfortable and excited to return." u'It was very late for any restaurants on Broadway so the hotel suggested we go to 9th. Used Yelp and found this amazing place. The Philly cheesesteak rolls were incredible. Service was excellent. Sliders were great. So glad we found this place. Kitchen open till 2am.' u"Food was ok but waiter completely ignored me the entire time. Most likely won't go back." u"I came here on a Saturday night it wasn't overly crowded and I had a seat at the bar. It is a little hard to find if you're not familiar with the area the sign is partially covered by someone else's. What really stood out to me was the service the bartender provided. After going to the bathroom I requested a new glass of water because I really didn't feel comfortable leaving my water unattended at a bar. He understood completely without me explaining why I would like a different glass. Can never be too careful with open glasses these days. That to me speaks volumes for the integrity and thoughtfulness within the establishment. Thank you Mark(?) for assisting me with my hesitation. More people need to show responsibility for their peers in the world especially females. I will be going back to this place." u'Brickyard was suggested by a friend and surprisngly I had never heard of it even though I\'ve been around the area and walked by so many times. \xa0It was quite the pleasant surprise as the food and the space was great. \xa04.5 stars from me overall!Decor/atmosphere - Brickyard has two different areas - one in the back that is definitely more of a dining atmosphere - not too loud but not too quiet. \xa0Awesome space to enjoy a dinner with a small group of friends without feeling squished or having to yell over other people. \xa0It was also nicely decorated for the holidays! It might even be a nice place for a casual date. \xa0The front part of the restaurant is more of a bar scene with minimal seating for eating.Service - ehhh. \xa0This is where the .5 came off - the waiter was a bit off. \xa0Something about his vibe just threw me off a little bit. \xa0In addition some of our orders were mixed up (toppings were mixed up among the 4 burgers) and when I tried to confirm if I got the right cheese (Cheddar but accidentally called it American Cheddar) in my burger I got a "that\'s impossible because we don\'t even carry that". \xa0Well excuse me just regular CHEDDAR then geez.The burger itself was delicious. \xa0It was cooked exactly to the temperature that I wanted it cooked and was juicy but not messy. \xa0I had sauteed onions on my burger because of the mix up but it was a nice addition to the burger and went well with the equally delicious 50 cent extra chipotle ketchup.What really shined here was the TRUFFLE FRIES. \xa0Oh my goodness please get the truffle fries. \xa0It says its an extra $3 for truffle fries but we didn\'t see a charge on our bill strangely enough. \xa0While these could have been hotter when they arrived at our table they were absolutely delicious. \xa0Best truffle fries I\'ve had in NYC. \xa0Super crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. \xa0Just the right amount of truffle - sometimes places really overdo it on the truffle oil but this was great. \xa0I would go back just to have these fries seriously.They also have a good selection of beers on tap as well as cocktails and specialty drinks. \xa0Bottom line - great burgers GET THE TRUFFLE FRIES ignore the service.' u'I had one of the best burgers of my life here. Really that good.I came in on a Tuesday afternoon after the lunch rush and before the dinner rush. The crowd was mostly working class men very enthusiastically watching a soccer game one lots of flat screens at least 5 or 6. The space is actually bigger than it first appears with more seating in the back. Once the game was off some background music came on and the first song played was Johnny Cash- yes!I ordered a medium rare burger with gruyere mushrooms onions and bacon. Like a lot of people I always order a burger medium rare because I\'m worried a burger ordered medium will come out medium well or worse. But this was cooked exactly as I ordered it so you can ask for what you really want here. The meat was soooo good the bacon was not over or under cooked the vegetables were fresh. French fries were crispy and nicely salted. My boy ordered the fish and chips and they were also fantastic! Crispy on the outside flaky and tender and fresh on the inside. We also split a salad because why not let\'s get crazy? They use mesclun in a lot of their salads and I just love that! So much better than romaine and boring iceberg I was a big fan. They have a great beer selection a few Belgians on there. They also do neat beer "cocktails" beyond your usual dark and stormy\'s. Service was a little on the slow side because the poor bartender was also doubling as the only server but she handled it well.' u"Went here with some friends to grab a bite to eat for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was around 1pm so it wasn't too crowded and we were able to be seated right away.After perusing the menu I decided to go with the make your own burger since I was feeling a little more like lunch. On my burger I got beef lettuce pickles avocado and chipotle ketchup--and a side of truffle fries.The burger was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. It was so tender and juicy that it was almost falling apart when I ate it. I would have loved the bun to be a little more toasted but other than that it was excellent.The fries were also very good. I don't know if I would consider them to be truffle fries as much a garlic and parmesan fries but they were delicious and crispy nonetheless.Overall I was not expecting much from this place and was pleasantly surprised. The wait staff was not always the most attentive but was friendly enough. Not a bad place to catch a game as well." u"After skating at Rockefeller my friend wanted to grab a bite to eat. I've tried to make reservations for this twice before but it has been always booked (between 5 to 7 time slot). So definitely call day or two before hand to make reservations (not the day of). But it was around 8:30 on a Saturday night so we decided just to walk over and hope there will be a open table. Luckily there was! The place a small quaint place. I really liked the atmosphere. My friend and I just shared appetizers together. We ordered the frickle (fried pickles) truffle fries and lamp nachos. The frickles were yummy! The mayo-type sauce that came with it was on point too. I like how they were cut and fried into bite size pieces. Truffle fries for DE-LISH! No ketchup or hot sauce necessary. The garnish was dressed all throughout the whole basket (thumbs up). I'm used to some places just garnishing the top and its lacks at the bottom of the basket. But not here! The lamb nachos...they were okay. Nothing special. The tinder date next to us ordered it too and the guy scarfed his down though. Drinks: Awesome selection of beers on tap! I love my IPAs so they had about 4 to choose from. They also have 5 beers that rotate through. I had the Cigar city IPA. It was light for an IPA so I think for non-IPA drinkers were like it too.Service: It was pretty fast when we were there! The girl always checked on us ever so often and made sure we were okay. I'll be coming back!" u"It's a shame I've never reviewed Brickyard before because I would've mentioned how much I love the food and the crowd. How I've brought so much business here and referred many clients of my own. Today totally changed that and I will be wary of when or if I go there.1:15 I sit down at the bar1:25 I finally get a menu and drink (lemonade)1:30 I ordered the chicken salad with no radishes and a side of fries1:55 I check on my order after trying to flags someone down 2:00 my food comes out wrong (radishes are easily removed so fine) and chicken freezing cold fries hot but doused in salt. The bartender explains she thought the other guy would get it despite seeing me without food in front of me. When he brings it out she apologizes for the mix up and says she'll bring another to her credit on the house. Too bad I wasted my entire lunch break waiting for food that was my first meal of the day. When I told her I couldn't wait for another meal she said she'd bring a fresh salad but without chicken. (What?) fine. She brings out arugula with grated parm and a measly side of 3 cherry tomatoes cut in half and less than a handful of blueberries. Never again." u"I came here for the burger based on some of the positive reviews here but unfortunately I thought it was just okay. \xa0I prefer my burgers plain with just lettuce and tomato. The burger as a whole was pretty bland so sauces are definitely necessary. \xa0To break the burger down:Buns: The buns were stale and dense to the point where they are quite inedible. \xa0I had to eventually eat the burger without the buns. Meat: A bit on the bland side. \xa0I asked for medium and it was as asked. \xa0Still I find the burger to be a bit dry.Lettuce and tomatoes were fresh. Fries: Home fries were more like steak fries.Truffle fries: 4.5 stars. \xa0They were the highlight of the meal. \xa0I may come back to try the wings but definitely won't be having the burger again." u'Stopped by for an early lunch and was happy with the food and service. I ordered the wrap lunch special and it was great. I would definitely stop by there again in the future.' u"Not a beer drinker much but have enjoyed several glasses here! The food they serve is a plus so go and make dinner reservations before all the drinking. It's a very relaxed and chill place to hangout and catch up with friends. Plus they close at 4A on the weekends so you can literally talk and drink all night long!!" u'An occasional customer only because of my proximity to Brickyard I met my mom and her husband for dinner after I got off work. Everyone enjoyed their dinner. I had the grilled chicken sandwich - sounds basic but every ingredient was tasty including the delicious focaccia roll. Mom had the blue corn-crusted mahi mahi and her husband had the brick pressed chicken. They both loved their meals as well. Nice beer list as well - try the Cigar City Jai Alai IPA and the SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale.Definitely a thumbs up and strong recommendation. To add our sever was very attentive and friendly.' u'Great solid rustic-meets-trendy place with a long list of beers cocktails whiskey wine build-your-own burgers foodie-friendly dinner entrees (steak/salmon/brick chicken) and upgraded standard pub fares. They also have a gluten-free menu for beers and burgers/desserts/entrees. I booked this place for our bi-monthly get together with a bunch of patent attorneys (#geeklife) and everyone agreed that this place is AWESOME. FOOD: -Build-your-own-burger: grassfed beef/bison/veggie patty bun/gluten free bun/lettuce sauces toppings cheeses. I got an amazing bison burger on lettuce with BBQ sauce and cheddar cheese. 5/5. -The sweet potato fries were great. They weren\'t overly greasy like fries can get at some places but were still crispy. Any wannabe cook worth her salt knows that sweet potatoes fries are much harder to get right than regular potato fries due to the sweet potato\'s higher moisture content. Speaking of salt the fries could use a bit more seasoning (paprika and a dash of cinnamon?) or perhaps paired with a sriacha-ketchup or BBQ-ketchup. I dipped the fries in the BBQ sauce that came with the burger and it was perfect. 4.5/5. -Brick Chicken: I didn\'t try this but both of my fellow diners got the entree and raved about it! It\'s a whole (half?) a chicken that is flattened (hence "brick") and breaded. The chicken is plated atop bacon mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas in a presentation that is worthy of a much more formal restaurant setting. DRINKS: This place not only has a mile-long list of brews but also cites the exact number of miles the beer took to get to restaurant just in case you\'re a secret hippie under that 9-to-5 suit who cares about farm(brewery?)-to-table. ATMOSPHERE: The pub was filled with a mix of young and middle-aged professionals. The music was mostly pop-indie (e.g. Death Cab for Cutie Muse etc.) and pop. Good vibes and packed with people but not overly so to where I am claustrophobic. The decor was hipster-sleek if that is ever a thing. VERDICT: Worth it and I might be recommending this joint to my coworkers since we\'re always looking for a new afterwork hangout spot.' u'After immersing in a inspirational full of talent poetry and musician open-mic Saturday afternoon my party of two came to Brickyard Gastropub to eat our fill with a lite dinner. \xa0We ordered:Porcini mushrooms Risotto- served piping hot that I burnt my mouth mushroom were MEH but the rice were prepared exceptionalNachos- served fully loaded with all various topping that the chip withheld and crunchyBrickyard Gastropub do not have blender to enable me a mocktail or a Virgin Pi\xf1a Colada. \xa0The entr\xe9e section of their menu "denotes" what beer is best paired. \xa0Service is attentive.']
39.Turco Mediterranean Grill,[u'Very Tasty and great portions. Quick polite service. I would love to see more drinks added to the menu. A sure winner!!' u'Though everything here smelled and looked good it was way too hot inside. The front door is obviously left open to lure customers. The downfall of this for us is that leaving the front door open allows all the flies and heat in.The four top right underneath the air conditioner all the way in the back had three flies buzzing around on it. I really did not want to fight off flies my entire meal so we left. No one behind the counter engaged me re: the air conditioning despite my voicing how hot it was and debating whether my party should stay.' u"This is for a Gyro place so the 5 starts is for restaurants in that category.What can I say fresh flat bread baked on the spot spicy and delicious seasonings.Very fresh and well rotated ingredients with a decent selection of Turkish essentials.Can't beat this place for lunch I've been coming here for 4 years and it's been consistent." u'Really flavorful food but the service is slow/could use a little improvement. I had the chicken shish wheat wrap and added some of the house hot sauce to it definitely liked the way all the ingredients worked together in the wrap. I would definitely come back and try out some other items on the menu but maybe at a slower time or go for take out. Definitely stop by if your in the area.' u'LOVE THIS PLACE!!!i have been here in 2012 2014 and now 2016 when visiting NY ... this food is so good i cannot get enough ... i live in Los Angeles and still cannot find a place that compares .... ordered hummus appetizer lamb gyro plate and lamb chix gyro combo platehummus: \xa0homemade and absolutely delicious ... served w their bread that is baked fresh throughout the day!lamb and chix gyro: \xa0meat is so good they usually sell out by evening so go early enough ... the plate is served w cabbage tomatoes lettuce red onion ... all of which is crisp fresh and has just the right amt of seasoning like vinegar salt ... got the bulgar which was \xa0cooked perfectly and complimented the dish very well ... you can also get plain rice it is a small spot but truly AMAZING food ... staff is nice and attentive... give this place a try when in NY!' u'We came here looking for a hole-in-the-wall style dinner and this place gave us just that. The prices were good and the meat was tasty. We ordered lamb gyro on the homemade bread which was made fresh and tasted way better than your average pita bread. Portion sizes were so big we ended up taking leftovers home. Dine-in service was efficient and our server was attentive. We hope to return soon!' u'I stopped here for a dinner take out meal. \xa0They have the huge gyro and chicken gyro meat grill in the front of the restaurant. \xa0I order the chicken gyro plate served with choice of rice or another grain (I forget what it was called) red cabbage/slaw lettuce onions tomatoes and 2 types of dipping sauce. \xa0I also ordered a side 1/2 tabouli and 1/2 red spicy dip. \xa0Came with a huge piece of freshly baked bread. \xa0The meal plus the side was $19.I enjoyed being able to watch the cook put everything together make the salad scoop the rice and slice the chicken off the gyro grill. \xa0He took his time which I appreciated.The food was absolutely delicious everything was fresh well seasoned meat so many levels of flavors spicy cool tangy everything. \xa0The only reason I am not giving this place 4 or 5 stars is because the guy that rang the order literally snatched the $20 bill out of my hand. \xa0I thought that was not only rude but awfully abrupt. \xa0Ironically they had a quote or word for the day posted on the board along with the daily special which was "politeness." \xa0There was nothing polite about the money aspect.Other than that the food was great and big portions you could save some for later. \xa0I would return.' u"Wonderful Turkish food! We used to pick up a lot when we lived in the area and we can't stop ordering seamless from here after moving away! Their chicken gyro platter with bulgur is the best the meat is moist and tender and full of flavor. The bulgur is nutty and delicious. The pita they give with the platter too is soft and yummy. Freshly baked every time! Other standout items are the lamb kofte and chicken adana. Oh and make sure to try their falafel platter as well it comes with these perfectly crispy falafel on a bed of smooth creamy hummus and spicy ezme. They throw in a little almond pudding too with each entree that is totally yummy and rounds out the meal perfectly! Ambiance is not much to speak of because this is really a take out kinda place but the food itself is fully deserving of five stars." u'AMAN YARABBI ! I stopped by Turco yesterday and ordered a chicken gyro sandwich to go. From the second I stepped in I was met by smiles from the employees-- definitely professional friendly and clean. This is a small no frills location; the bar where the dishes are made is right up front and there is seating in the back. My sandwich was \xa0$7 and it was super satisfying! \xa0I was told by the man at the register that my sandwich would take 10 minutes -- that is how fresh the meat is -- they cooked it right in front of me. The bread used in the Gyro is not a simple pita but a fluffy Turkish bread with sesame seeds -- I had never eaten it before and was pleasantly surprised by how well the texture of the bread went with the chicken + veggies. It was also thick enough to absorb the tzatziki and hot sauce that came with the sandwich. The tzatziki was watery but flavorful and the hot sauce was AMAZING -- it was the first time in a while that I didnt have to dump the whole container of my sandwich a little went a loooong way. NOW the STAR of the show was the chicken. SO soft so succulent so flavorful... you literally have to experience it! While waiting for my sandwich I spotted Baklava and grabbed a tin (3 for $5). I was a bit disappointed by the baklava as it was super soggy on the bottom and very oily -- only due to this would I give Turco a 4.5/5. In all -- try the chicken gyro sandwich!! Amazing  satisfying food for a great price-- there is definitely a lot of love and soul in this food. I will DEFINITELY be coming back :)' u"This Mediterranean place is a gem in the Hell's Kitchen area. \xa0At work we have declared every other Wednesday as Turco Wednesdays. \xa0If you have not tried this place yet you're missing out!I have tried this place countless number of times for lunch and dinner and the quality of food is fantastic and just absolutely delicious. \xa0I've recruited many people in ordering fromhere :)My personal favorites are the chicken Adana and lamb Adana. \xa0Both these meats are perfectly seasoned and grilled. \xa0It's best to have it as a sandwich on their homemade Turkish pide bread. \xa0If you're craving a larger portion then go for the plate which comes with rice or cracked wheat and more bread on the side (yum!)While I do enjoy chicken gyros I find the gyro meat a bit on the salty side but it's a sure winner within our work team. \xa0Also their falafel is quite flavorful too if you're looking for a vegetarian option.Delivery service is rapid when placing your order online as well as their dine-in service. \xa0Your meal comes with sauces (light mint flavored yogurt based sauce and hot sauce) and sometimes they'll even throw in a sample of their rice pudding with your meal. \xa0Plus point for that.To the reader please try Turco now; you won't be disappointed!" u'I stopped by for a quick dinner to try yet another falafel. They are a takeout based Mediterranean style grill. A falafel sandwich is only $5 and it is HUGE. They use Turkish bread instead of pita which is rare to find. The falafel was a little undercooked in the middle and not too flavorful but gets a 6/10 on my falafel o meter. A good place to go if you want platters or sandwiches for a reasonable price.' u'Walking down The streetI sawYes I saw youA beautiful Piece of meatJuicy drippingIt is spinningI am going crazyI want meatI want donnerI want shawarmaI want it now.I step inI sit I orderI waitI am losing itIt comesI see It isNot whatI sawJuicy drippingBeautiful piece Of meatIt is not juicyIt is not drippingMy shawarmaWhat happenYour oldYour dryI feel violatedWhy meYou looked So good At the windowYou teased meYou where coldBad girlYou whereOnce beautifulAnd tastyOh wellTill we Meet againI stillWant youShawarma.............' u"Since we were in the area we decided to stop by. \xa0 \xa0The staff were very welcoming and friendly. The place didn't seem something special but the food was very good and affordable. \xa0What made the meal so good was the bread from what we understood they make it.Also the place was clean. Worth trying for sure." u"The food is so yummy and they have healthy choices. The service is fast. All in all it's great!" u"I had such a positive experience hereVery vegan friendly and delicious Affordable big portions great for sharingLots of free stuff like peppers and other deliciousnessAnd last but not least I needed the waitress to do me a big favor. My husband locked himself out of the apartment and I was about to see a play nearby and there wasn't enough time for him to get to me. Waitress agreed to hold the key for him without hesitation and was so friendly before and after I made this request.So glad to have this as a new delicious option" u"Awesome food. Especially their bread is the best. So soft and fresh. Their meat is very juicy and hummus is just perfect. Definitely try the appetizer platter as it's shown in the picture. It's very good." u'DO NOT USE THE PLASTIC CUPS IF YOU ARE DINING IN-Scroll down to "Lamb Gryo" to skip the mini tiradeThis place seems awesome for takeout or a quick gyro but since we sat down I ended up having a very unfortunate but annoying encounter with the hostess and the manager. This place doesn\'t serve tap water so we had no choice to get bottled water. They brought plastic cups and after pouring there were little bits of plastic floating in the water. It could not be from the Poland Spring bottles so it was definitely the cups. I brought one of the cups to the manager (the plump gentleman who runs the show) and he said there was nothing there. Seriously? Of course the customer is never right. The hostess also agreed with them. Obviously I was the one lying. They offered to not charge for the water. I was more shocked at the numerous other people sitting there drinking from these cups. They felt no urgency to tell the patrons about this. I brought another cup that had conspicuous pieces of plastic and the hostess finally saw she was wrong and threw it out immediately. The manager even brought a "fresh" pack of plastic cups from downstairs. After I inspected them let me tell you these cups were also the same. There were bits of plastic clinging to the inside of these cups. I told them. They didn\'t care. Again they didn\'t feel like telling the other patrons drinking from these cups. They probably bought a huge bulk order of plastic cups from 2005 and still keep using them. This entire exchange lasted over 20 minutes..- Customers are always right. Don\'t argue with customers. - These people need to take a class on courtesy. The stubbornness to address the problem was appalling. Then the audacity on their part to accuse me of lying was beyond reproach. LAMB GRYOAn abundance of thinly-sliced lamb was bursting forth from this sandwich. The quality of the Lamb was superb. Juicy and flavorful and just the right amount of charred smokiness. Their "Everything" Medley of red cabbage lettuce tomato and red onion added a great crunch to the overall bite. Maybe ask for less lettuce and they should cube the tomatoes instead of putting thick slices. Top it off with Tahini (50 cents) and you have the perfect most satisfying meal ever. Also the portion was HUGE. The biggest gyro I\'ve every had I barely finished it!Besides the terrible and shameful experience the food is absolutely amazing here. I even apologized to both of them at the end and made it clear I wasn\'t yelling or chastising them but simply alarming them of this problem. They gladly smiled and said ok. Clearly they felt no need to apologize to me of their child-like attitude and inability to admit they messed up. It\'s easy to smile when everything is going your way but you can tell a lot about a person when they have to handle adversity. Both of these people need to grow up. Recommended: Lamb Gyro w/ everything & Tahini' u'I order from them on eat24. Delivery was very fast. Delivery person very kind and professional and the most important: the food was delicious! I ordered a falafel sandwich lentil soup cacik (cucumber humus) and a Turkish soda. Everything was perfect! Will definitely order again and try new things on the menu. I recommend this place!' u'How can I just let you eat kebab just watch you eat without a tasteWhen I sit here smelling every bite you take oohYou\'re the only one who really fed me at allHow can you eat all that Doner meatwhen all I can do is watch you eatCos we\'ve shared the pitas in the past and even shared baklavaYou\'re the only one who shared her literal not proverbial kebab with me at allSo Turco look at me now oh there\'s just an empty plateAnd there\'s nothing left here to feed meJust the memory of kebabTurco look at me now well there\'s just an empty plateAnd you ordering one for me is against all odds (and you\'ve got sauce on your face)youtube.com/watch?v=_ZMU\u2026What to get: Doner Kebab duhhhhWhat to do next: Become an organ DonerDo disco singers eat here?: Doner Summer doesWhat about Britney Spears?: Idk but if you find out Doner let me be the last to knowVery smart people from this restaurant once invented a colour. They called it "the colour of the Caribbean sea" well that\'s the English translation. The actual name is "Turco-ise."So to put it bluntly Turco is one of the best Doner Kebabs I\'ve had in North America. The UK (and Europe in general) is full of delicious Doner but in North America it\'s at once hard to find and not particularly great when you do. If you want Chicago-style Gyros then sure N Am is full of options. But if you want Doner you better go to the Blood Bank because the Turkish kebab sliced off the rotunda is hard to come by and when you find it it will probably suck (TurKiss I\'m looking at you). Turco breaks the mold because it\'s actually damn good and delicious Doner easily the best I\'ve had in New York City.I was thinking of starting up a company that takes tourists to every kebab shop in NYC. I would call it "The Turco Tour Co." What do you think.The Doner is served on a large Turkish roll (similar to the way it\'s served in Germany) drenched in white and red sauces with plenty of salad. The kebab meat is sizzling and juicy salty and tasty. It\'s like a Gyro but different. You sort of kinda somewhat have to try it to know what I mean. It\'s a little grizzlier and chewier than Gyro meat and a little more heavily-seasoned and thin but it\'s still more similar to Gyro than it is to the chunks of chopped-off kebab that the Lebanese and Israelis call Shawarma. Now come and get in bed with me and I shawarma you right up.I\'m glad I finally found a good Doner in NYC. It Turco long time but I got there in the end (that\'s what she said).The price is surprisingly competitive for a large Doner sandwich (well under $10) the service is nice (depending on who you get the girls here have always been lovely to me) and if you call ahead it\'ll be ready within about 15 mins. However if you walk in and expect a fast to-go order you may be waiting quite awhile.I dated a Turkish girl once. She was tiny and awesome. She was the small package that good things came in. However she found a rich Turkish boyfriend (who wasn\'t as good at dealing with her packages as I was. They called me the mailman because I always delivered) and he told me to Turco long walk off a short pier. Which was so 1950s Back To The Future but hey.I was last here about 4 months ago and will return before the year is out. I\'ve now had Doner Kebab from here 4 or 5 times and there will be many more stops in the future if Turco keeps the standard at the delicious level it\'s at. Stop by Turco and enjoy some real Turkish real cheap real delicious Doner.Anyway this kebab is so good that I\'m giving the owners of this restaurant their own country. It\'ll have to be a former Soviet state because Putin is too busy trying to swallow Ukraine (you know Putin loves to swallow) to notice. From now on the nation of Doner will be known as "Turcomenistan." Sounds like an Eminem song featuring Dido. Yo Turco this is your biggest fan from Turcomenistan.Speaking of Dido if I ever date Dido and then I find my bff in bed with her I\'m gonna sing:Ahhh I saw Dido in your arms tonightIt must have been something you saidI saw Dido in your arms tonightyoutube.com/watch?v=LC_Z\u2026(By the way what the hell is "Loving By Proxy" and can I try it?)It\'s just Dido in your arms tonightIt must have been the emotionless monotone way she sang "White Flag" to youI should have walked awayOr I should have added an "L" to her name right between the "i" and the "d".' u"Absolutely delicious!! We were looking for somewhere fast and delicious for lunch and we knew we couldn't resist when we saw the lamb and chicken roasting in the window were calling to my husband and me. Huge portions for the price friendly fast service and authenticity make this a real gem! I recommend the cacik appetizer (dill yogurt mint and cucumbers) and chicken gyro platter with bulgar. The shepherd salad is also fabulous--fresh chopped veggies mingle with dill vinegar and lemon to create a refreshing appetizer that is just perfect on a hot day. The next time we're in NYC we'll definitely be stopping in again!"]
42.Fresh From Hell,[u"Awesome food had the special Panini of the day: Mozzarella Tomato Basil. WOW!Also had the Super Smoothie best smoothie I've ever had...they make their own almond milk in-house!Their also very friendly and conveniently located from Times Square (we were on the way to Intrepid Museum)." u'This place is awesome..... Really amazing ... I initially posted a bad review because they were running out of items a lot but it was probably because they were new and going through the normal things new establishments go through. I continued going back and things have gotten way better.The food tastes great and is always very fresh. I go here all the time the juices and smoothies are fantastic as well.' u'I had a certificate from Restaurants.com that I wanted to use and this place was close to work and seemed like a good lunch spot.My intestinal instincts were right. It\'s a cute little soup/salad/sammich/smoothie spot that doesn\'t break the bank. Everything is priced under $10 but you\'ll be spending closer to $20 if you want more than one thing. I order a large mixed salad and a smoothie. The salad wasn\'t what I was expecting in that I\'m used to places like Chopt where I tell them what I want and they add it. Here you have pre-made "salad" toppings such as tuna salad bean salad greek salad etc. that go on top of your greens. With a large you\'re allowed to pick 3 options. The salad was filling and I really enjoyed it.I opted for the Boo Berry smoothie and thought it was pretty good. Filling (Strawberries blueberries raspberries banana vanilla almond milk vanilla whey protein) and flavorful. Given the proximity to my office this is a place I\'d come to again. I wish the menu was a *bit* larger but this also does me the favor of not being overwhelmed with options.' u"Adorable place in the middle of Hell's Kitchen with fresh organic fruits and vegetables! Inventive drinks and great salads.. And I can't wait to try their oatmeal with coconut milk!" u'Amazing little spot! Just tried the tomato cheddar soup and I can say is WOW! So happy to have found this spot. Everything is super fresh and delicious.' u"This place is likable. And I really really want to like it more than 2 stars but it just doesn't do it for me. I have been 3 times and tried 3 different things and I think I am finally ready to admit that this just isn't a place for my taste.The items I have tried:Turkey sandwich - it was an OK sandwich. It was not bad but it was not great and honestly I make better at home. And it's $9 for a basic make at home turkey sandwich...A smoothie - I do not remember which one probably because I only remember the price... $9! For a 16oz cup of not bad but not great smoothie. I am willing to pay for a good protein shake but this place has nothing on liquiteria and it's more expensive - like ???Chicken Salad Sandwich - I thought for sure this would be it. This would be the item to win me over. But it wasn't that good two big watery hunks of tomato very large pieces of roasted red pepper and chewy chicken pieces. My cafeteria at work makes a better chicken salad sandwich and it's a work cafeteria.Notice I didn't say anything was bad. It's not bad but then you look at the price and your like - Hey! This is not a good deal. This is a bad deal for me. I'm sorry I wanted to like you! I really did." u"Looking for some oatmeal visiting New York came across this little place. Super yummy and fresh! Sweet coconut oatmeal. Almost tastes like a hot Acai bowl. \xa0Alvarado's Sprouted wheat bagel toasted with Vegan Cashew Cream cheese..very healthy and yummy as well. The service was great and hospitable. \xa0Quiet little corner in the busy city." u'Very inviting little place with excellent healthy food choices at affordable prices! \xa0Perfect for lunch. \xa0I love the name!' u'I started eating here because I was getting really tired of eating at Pret a Manger EVERY DAY.The sandwich selection isnt huge but they are all really tasty. \xa0My favorite is the chicken salad which comes with red pepper and sprouts (on a good day). \xa0You can really taste that all the ingredients are really fresh.I think perhaps because they are new the smoothie recipes sometimes taste funny but if you stick with a more basic tried and true recipe its sure to be good. I like the "what the hell" \xa0smoothie with avocado.The salads is probably the most plentiful option. \xa0You choose a base and then have a bunch of really good toppings to choose from. \xa0 If you are a salad fanatic this is definitely your place. \xa0I also hear the coconut milk oatmeal is BOMB.' u"We walked in to get a pre-theatre pick-up the prepared salads /options looked good but we couldn't get any acknowledgement and the maybe 5 seats were occupied by 3 people and their belongings. \xa0Also the AC was lacking so we left -tant pis!" u"This is the best smoothy place ever. It has a distinctively lovely organic smell and the owner is very nice. My favorite is the boo berry. It's everything you'd ever want in a smoothy. The service is fast and personal it's a really small but cute place. The best places for smoothies in the city." u"Just ate a panini and a soup from here. The panini was tomato basil and mozz but I got arugula so one star off for that-- I really wanted \xa0that basil flavor. It wasn't bitter arugula though & very fresh mozz. that hasn't irritated my stomach so that was good.I'm under the weather & the veggie chicken soup really helped me feel better. It had parsley nice chunks of potato and carrot and pretty generous shredded chicken. Super tasty and not salty; a plus!!! If you're missing that high blood pressure level sodium by all means add it yourself and good luck with that. It's a little pricy for me for everyday lunch. ( maybe I'll just order 1 item instead of two) but it's very fresh they care about what ingredients they use and it's tasty so I'll definitely be back. Also you can order breakfast--the oatmeal or sprouted bagel after breakfast so I heart that too. Also very friendly and attentive staff." u'Fairies are real! I walked into FFH on a beautiful breezy June morning birds chirping outside from the giant green trees above and the music is more massage therapy than restaurant. The staff is chill and super helpful. And the juice more from heaven than hell. Namaste.' u'I had been waiting for Fresh from Hell to open to experience it. Their menu consists of sandwiches juices soups which change daily and salads. It is a very small space with no table seating and limited counter seating. Their breakfast special consists of either creamy coconut oatmeal or greek yogurt and seasonal fruit. On the day I went I got a large split pea soup (it needed something???) And the turkey avocado sandwich on italian bread with lettuce tomato and honey mustard. It was very good. You can also get greens on top of which you can get a choice of three salads. An excellent choice for kosher or vegetarian eaters. I would recommend and return.' u"Everything I've had here has been incredibly delicious. It's my new favorite place to grab breakfast or lunch when I'm in midtown. The smoothies are soooo good and I've also loved all of the sandwiches I've tried. AND the oatmeal has coconut milk and berries and is steal for under $6. Highly recommend! Also the people are nice." u'was walking around on a freezing Wednesday looking for lunch and discovered this new looking place on a side street in the 40\'s. stopped in to give it a try.i got the half sammie small soup combo for 8.50. chose chicken salad for the sammie butternut squash for the soup.was a solid portion all tasted quite healthy a good "under 10 bucks" lunch option.i\'d like the option to get the half sammie + LARGE soup and pay a bit more but maybe next time they\'ll have that as a menu / secret menu option in the computer :-)' u"Normally people don't want to write reviews of new undiscovered places out of fear that they'll be discovered and mobbed. This is the opposite--i want more people to find this place so that it stays open and provides a local healthy food option in this neighborhood. Fresh from Hell has yummy freshly prepared salads smoothies and sandwiches at reasonable price points. To you need to know anything more? For the same price as a bland salad a roni at a place like chop't you could be eating a salad topped with three of their daily revolving side salads which doesn't make sense but tastes great. There's a basil vinaigrette that I dream about. Etc" u'Other sandwich and juice bars in New York City just cannot compare. \xa0My roommates and I come to Fresh From Hell almost everyday whether its to get a boost after work or after a workout. \xa0This place never disappoints and we are so delighted this has become a neighborhood staple. \xa0Thank you Fresh From Hell!' u'High prices given the small portion sizes. Walk the extra couple hundred feet to 9th Avenue and get a more substantial meal.' u'After passing by many times due to the name curiousity won and I stopped in for a soup and salad. \xa0I am glad I did because it is both fresher and cheaper than a lot of similar options in the area.Good healthy lunchtime option will definitely go back.']
37.Steak Freak,[u'An excellent lunch option...so long as you get there before 11:30 or after the lunch rush. The wait can be a bit overwhelming at times but is well worth it. "Steak" may be the operative word in the cart\'s name but the Chicken Manchurian is by far my favorite dish. It\'s got a lot of flavor juicy and generally very tasty. I usually opt for a combination with the Chicken Manchurian and Beef Basil. For $10 the beef chicken brown rice and salad are a bargain. You get enough food to fill you up but not so much that you are inevitably lulled into a mid-afternoon nap at your desk.' u"The line takes much longer than it looks like it will take!! Keep that in mind if you're on a lunch break or go before noon when it's not as crowded.I only got to visit this truck once because I just don't have enough time to wait in line and I don't yet have an intern that I can send to get it. But it is still my favorite food truck around. Get the steak basil it's awesome. A great blend of steak and Asian fusion sauces. The two guys working here really work hard and make amazing food go check it out!" u"One of my favorite food trucks to hit up for lunch in Midtown. The food is consistently good and the service is always on point. There's always a huge line especially during peak hours (12-2 pm) but the guys working in the truck are always quick and polite.I've had the Chicken Manchurian Steak Basil and Steak Chimichurri. My favorite is the Steak Basil. The steak is always well-seasoned and very flavorful never overcooked and always juicy. Each entree is accompanied by white or brown rice and a side salad. For $8 or $9 in Midtown you can't go wrong.Overall this food truck is a great option for an affordable filling lunch in Midtown." u"Been workin in the city for a few days now and this gotta be my favorite food truck near my job! I got the basil lime steak with brown rice and salad. You get alot of food for a decent price... Wait wasnt horrible compared to other food trucks and the service was friendly...I'll definitely be visiting again for lunch." u"I REAAAALLLLY want to like this place because the food is absolutely delicious and it is the best affordable food that I've had in Midtown but.. I waited almost an hour and thirty minutes for my meal so.. I would love to try this place again but the line has definitely scarred me.This place was kind of difficult to find since the Yelp address is misleading. It's in front of a chase bank located on 50th street between 6th and 7th avenue. There's a whole row of food trucks here and the line for Steak Freak is always the longest so.. it's difficult to miss. As I mentioned early I was on this line for practically an hour and a half since they only take 3 orders at a time and when people begin ordering more than one plate for themselves the wait is extended even more. Their system of ordering really needs to be improved the guy in the front memorizes them.. when it would be much more efficient to write it down or as others have said give out a number. It takes a little bit for the food to be prepared probably 10 minutes after you've ordered. I guess it's my fault because I got here around 1:15pm just in time for the lunch rush.The food itself is delicious and goes well with the spicy mayo and white sauce that they give you. The meat is a little rough and overcooked but not a dealbreaker. The salad is crunchy and tastes good mixed in with your meal.. nothing bad I could really say about the food.. But please!! I can't spend my entire lunch break waiting on line!!Oh.. You also pay AFTER you receive your food so.. if you don't have cash you definitely have time to go to the bank to get it." u"I find it hard to give 5 stars for a food truck-- it has to be reallyyyy amazing so consider this a 4.5 (because I didn't get to try their steak frites since they alwayssss run out of fries early).I came here for lunch and ordered the sesame steak. The sauce was flavorful and the steak was just right (just the right amount of chewy and tender). You can choose between white or brown rice and it comes with some salad.The guy handling the truck itself was SUPER NICE. Always smiles and always polite-- excellent service.I will definitely be stopping by again. Awesome food decent prices and excellent service." u"Where to even begin! Easily my favorite food cart for lunch in midtown. Chicken Manchurian is my go-to with just the right amount of spice to kickstart the afternoon. If you're feeling particularly unhealthy Steak Freak has the best Cajun fries I've literally ever had. Ever." u"Affordable and tasty food in Midtown. \xa0Who doesn't like food truck? \xa0Whenever I'm visiting my friend's office he always takes me here. \xa0Steak chimichurri is our fave. \xa0Generous portion for the price you pay. \xa0I also tried chicken basil but .. it's not the kind of basil I used to have. \xa0It tasted more like ... general sao to me. \xa0Nonetheless it's good. \xa0The line can be long during lunch hours but it moves pretty quickly." u"Their steak basil is amazing! The first time I had it was slightly better than the second time but at least they are preparing everything fresh in the cart. My friend loves the steak with kimchi. Another friend who I brought wasn't too too crazy about the chimichurri steak but loved my steak basil. Long story short I'd recommend this cart and highly recommend the steak basil.When I've been there there haven't been long lines to order most of the people standing around are just waiting for their food to be ready. Don't know if they take card I just order then cross the st to take cash out.. you'll have a few minutes to kill." u'I came for a short business trip to NY and as soon as I asked about food trucks this was "the one". \xa0Now I understand why. \xa0The food is yummy! I didn\'t give it 5 stars because it was a little bit of a wait but nothing outrageous. \xa0I will come back to try other dishes next time that in town!' u'I work upstairs in the building where they setup. The food is excellent. My top 2 recommendations are the Honey Glazed Chicken and the Steak Basil.These guys are very professional and friendly. The serving size of their plates are generous.I try my best to send as many people in my building down to them and always leave them a tip. Keep up the good work guys!' u'Line around lunch time moves pretty slow. Food is OK I usually go for the chicken or beef basil.' u"It was difficult to find this truck because the location on the yelp page is inaccurate. I finally did find it and tried it out. The lines were really LONG & they don't accept card. I ordered basil steak with rice it was delicious! The portions were decent sized and I enjoyed it. My coworkers had the chicken dish and they also gave a good review. The service was great the truck workers explained the difference between all the dishes and recommended their favorite. The pricing wasn't as great as I'd expected. I paid $11 and that's definitely more than I'm used to spending at a food truck. Not sure if I'd get it again because of the price as there are other trucks that sells similar items for much cheaper. I would recommend that you try it. I'm told the sesame steak is also a great choice." u'Amazing meal. First time there and for sure will be back. The sesame steak was fantastic. It was only 12:30 already sold out of fries will have to try those next time. But the flavor of the steak was unbelievable' u"Wow. I haven't even finished eating my Steak Basil but I had to pause to write this review. Can't speak for any of the other dishes but this is delicious- flavorful and fresh! And SAUCE! It didn't even need extra sauce because it's so flavorful but they have me two little sauces which are also great! I'll have to be back to try other dishes." u'This is probably my favorite workday lunch food truck on "truck row" (on the north side of 50th St. between 7th Ave and Ave of the Americas - the Yelp address currently listed is incorrect). I\'ve been frequenting this truck since late 2014 and love it! Line/Wait Time/CASH ONLY: If you go before 12PM the wait time is short (~5-10min max) with only a few people in line. But any time between 12-1PM expect to wait for 15-25 min+ because they draw a large lunch crowd (and deserving!). I will say the guys working in the truck are pretty efficient so don\'t let the long lines dissuade you from waiting. Like other reviewers have mentioned it\'s CASH ONLY but that\'s to be expected with a food truck. No gripes there.Food:I\'ve had the Steak Basil Lime Steak Chimichurri and Steak Frites; of the 3 my favorite and go-to is the Steak Basil (which is also their most popular and rightly so). Of course the spotlight of the dish is on the steak which is well-marinated with a dark brown sauce that has the right amount of sweetness and paired with the spicy mayo and white sauce that comes as a side it\'s even better. Alongside the steak are roasted green/red peppers that are perfect accompaniments. You also get a heaping mound of hot white rice with a side salad (lettuce and a sprinkle of purple cabbage). Sometimes I opt for extra rice instead of the salad if it\'s "that kind of day" which the truck guys are happy to accommodate w/o extra charge. It is a good amount of food for the price ($9). I wasn\'t crazy about the other two dishes. The Steak Chimichurri wasn\'t as flavorful as the steak basil and you basically just get two small plastic containers of Chimichurri sauce to pour on top. The steak in the Steak Frites is not marinated and I think is only seasoned with salt/pepper; for the price ($10) you\'re only getting 5 pieces of small steak strips and some fries - it wasn\'t as filling nor did it taste as good as the Steak Basil.Overall I think this truck provides a super tasty affordable lunch ($9 on avg per dish) in Midtown where the variety of lunch options is not the best. It\'s a nice respite from my usual boring options I frequent in the area (i.e. Bocca Cafe Duke etc).' u'Almost exactly a year since I\'ve had it; the same dish I\'ve had is now called "Steak Basil" and it comes with salad and rice. \xa0It is amazing. \xa0Long wait but worth it.Nice guys there too.' u"I love this food truck! It's always a long line during lunch hour... So try to get there early or late. I usually order basil steak with rice. Loved the sauce it uses and the streak is cooked perfectly. The portion is very generous comparing to other food truck around the area with the same dish. Definitely recommend!" u"I guess good things do come in small packages! \xa0I usually don't dine from food trucks but I was dying for something different. I came across this truck which is luckily a half block from my job. \xa0I'm a steak lover and I figured why not and there isn't anything on this menu above $10 . I decided to try the steak and frites ( $10) and it was AMAZING! The steak was cooked a bit more well than I prefer but even with that it was still delicious. The steak is \xa0seasoned nicely and not dry at all. The Cajun fries are also tasty and crunchy. The meal even came with a handful of \xa0fresh mixed greens which I really appreciated. The portions of both the steak and fries were more than enough. The wait time was also pretty impressive. My food was ready in less than 10 mins with a smile. There is no question I will be back. \xa0I almost forgot to mention the little sauces they have. The hot sauce and dill sauce are definitely worth trying." u"All day on this one! \xa0Delicious addition in Midtown West. \xa0This vendor is far too scrumptious. \xa0Most of the time you're not sure how good vendor food is until AFTER you consume it. \xa0Ya know what I mean! \xa0So out on a mission I went to find some good red meat and BOOM! \xa0Enter Steak Freak. \xa0I ordered the basil lime steak dish and the Cajun fries. \xa0The seasoning mix for the fries is simple yet is a perfect balance! \xa0And the beef . . . OH the beef. . . I can't say enough about it honestly. \xa0Tender favorable no bad bites no odd fat pieces! \xa0I LOVED IT!And I will come back over and over to see these guys!"]
173.Arriba Arriba,[u"Everything about this place is just perfect. - Fishbowl margaritas? Yes. - Strong fishbowl margaritas? Yes. - Strong fishbowl margaritas in a variety of natural-tasting flavors (such as watermelon which is amazing!): YES. The food is pretty good too but if you're not getting a margarita you're doing it wrong. And I wouldn't even say I particularly like margaritas...There's great energy here it's always busy and it has a convivial vibe. I've almost never waited for a table when I've wanted one and the service is great. Arriba Arriba is a winner!" u'HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I along with my sister and her friend arrived at this location around 10pm (on August 6 2016) and was seated outside (right near the entrance). \xa0As I was looking through the menu the server rudely "dropped down" the chips and salsa onto our table which caused my menu to fall onto the ground. \xa0Without saying anything he went to the next table and dropped off their chips and salsa. \xa0I immediately told the server "Excuse me but the very least you could do is say I\'m sorry." \xa0He then comes back picks up the menu and says "My bad anything else?" - with an attitude as if I was the one inconveniencing him - and he immediately walks off back into the restaurant. \xa0I called for a manager who came out. \xa0As I was starting to explain to the manager about what occurred the server comes back and tries to explain his version. \xa0I allowed him to tell the story the way he saw it (at this time he still was defensive as if I did something wrong to him). \xa0I then explained to both the server and the manager that as a paying customer I demand a certain level of respect and service. \xa0I should never have to come into a place that I am paying my money to to be disrespected or having the feeling like I am an inconvenience. \xa0The server says he apologized but his "my bad anything else" was unprofessional highly disrespectful and downright rude. \xa0Though the manager apologized he (in my opinion) did not do anything to diffuse or even make me feel comfortable staying (and I\'m not about to have anyone spit in my food...no thanks)! \xa0It would have been nice for him to acknowledge the improper service that we had been given and even offer to comp or provide something as a showing of "we don\'t tolerate this at Arriba Arriba." \xa0Because we received nothing we decided to leave and go to another restaurant.I emailed the general manager about this occurrence and he apologized saying that he had an idea of who the server was (which leads me to believe that this server has previously had problems with other customers)! \xa0The GM is (allegedly) going to talk to the server and the night manager so hopefully no one else has to go through what we did. \xa0The GM said he hopes I give them another chance but he did not give me any incentive whatsoever (e.g. free meal free drinks etc) to come back. \xa0So I will not be going back!!We all know that great leadership starts at the top so if the GM didn\'t offer me anything then I (nor you) should expect anything more than an "iffy" apology if this happens to you. \xa0Unfortunately I am still unsatisfied at how this issue has been "resolved" and that\'s why I felt the need to post this. \xa0I hope if you choose to go to Arriba Arriba (on 51st/9th) that you will have a better experience!Unfortunately I did not get the manager\'s nor the servier\'s name but just beware if you sit outside!!!' u"Went here once with two colleagues for lunch and you honestly can't beat the price. An entr\xe9e and a drink (margarita sangria or wine) with chips and salsa all for less than 11 bucks. I went with the classic Chicken enchiladas and my colleagues tried the burrito and the quesadillas all of which was very bland and subpar. If you're looking for flavor packing food that will make your taste buds happy this is not the place for you. On the other hand yay cheap Mexican food (with alcohol)!" u"This place has always been our restaurant mostly for birthday celebrations and why not the ambiance is truly festive. The happy hour cocktail drinks are large and cheap and come with chips and salsa. One can easily decide on their menu selections while their price point are very competitive in the Hell's Kitchen area. We always go with the guacamole as appetizer and our all time favorites include Fajitas with choices of grilled chicken steak shrimp and veggies and served with sour cream guacamole cheese beans and flour tortillas Enchiladas and red snapper al cilantro (fillet snapper simmered with in pico de gallo salsa and served with white rice and salad).The customer service here is super! They are very attentive but not intrusive. I can't wait to come back here for another friends' birthday celebration!" u"Extremely over rated. Shame on the previous yelpers for giving this spot more than one star! This restaurant is a total FAIL!!! The food is mediocre eeeeeh!! The drinks are OKAY not great. The guacamole tasted horrible. How can anyone get that wrong?!?? I will not be returning. To top it off I saw a ROACH crawling around during a very busy time.. The bathrooms are DISGUSTING!! Service is slow. The hostess was rude!! I'll passssss!!" u"This might be my favourite place I visited during my trip. In part due to the mama margarita in part from realising it was a popular gay bar only after an hour when Dolly Parton had been on loop.We got here around 11 having been at the baseball craving some food and margaritas. When we ordered the waitor mentioned that it was going to be last orders soon. So he suggested going for the large one aka the mama at $20 we didn't quite know what to expect. Let's just say it was a margarita fishbowl the size of my head. Led to slight brain freeze. I went for a blue curaco whilst my friend had a chambord both were delicious. The salsa and chips were great and free but when they ask if you want guacamole this tends to be an extra! Admittedly happy to pay for it as it was good guacamole.The menu was extensive with make your own options to specials to burritos etc etc. I opted for a single chicken taco which came with rice beans and sour cream. This was a large portion and enough food for having snacked at the baseball. You could also order up to 3 items in the make your own option which I really liked. I would come back here quickly if I could. Great music great food and strong cocktails." u"Four stars mainly for the ambiance and the drinks. The food is so-so but what stands out is the amazing vibe that this place has. Great decor good music and friendly staff. They also have a dj spinning tunes on the weekends and weekday nights as well.The drinks are really good here. Go for one of the flavored margaritas and make it a 'Mama' if you feel brave! 28 ounces of Margarita will make you happy for sure :) The food is okay some dishes are a bit flavorless. But the rest of the experience definitely makes up for it." u"Walking through Hell's Kitchen the wife & I seriously had no idea what we wanted to have for dinner until we came across this busy little place which seemed like it had a good atmosphere. Without a prior reservation we were lucky to actually get a seat but luckily we did. The service was pretty good. Very prompt service from our waiter & there was a guy that was rushing around topping up people's water glasses. I actually did like that table water was not just put in a bottle & placed on your table. The guy pouring the table water did ensure that there was ice in your glass as well. I had the chimichangas and a side of steamed vegetables. The steamed vegetables was just broccoli & carrot - even though this was not noted in the menu I was quite happy with those two vegetables alone. The chimichangas wasn't too bad. I have had worse but on the other hand I have had better. I felt that it wasn't loaded enough and was a bit on the plain side. The pricing wasn't too bad for what we got though. A few downfalls of the place. It was just soooooo dark in there. The brightest light in our area was basically a tea light candle on our table. Don't get me wrong I do like the romantic mood lighting at a restaurant but I also do enjoy actually being able to see what is on my plate in front of me - way too dark! We also found that it was a little difficult to hear each other speak with the loud music and it wasn't really any sort of Mexican/Spanish sort of music - it was like we were waiting for Robin Williams from Birdcage to come out of a hidden room or even Priscilla Queen of the Desert. Very weird indeed." u"Yikes! Never returning here. Our server was a diva with a terrible attitude who ran out to tell us that our 18% tip was not enough for his hard (not) work. Who does that? And why does management allow their servers to harass people? What if we didn't have the money? We paid for our meal. Did we deserve to be embarrassed on the street as though we were skipping out on our bill.To top it off the food was not that great. I paid $18 for vegetables and a piece of cut up chicken on top. Hardly worth it. I recommend skipping this overly crowded loud place and go to chipotle (with the risk of their meat and all)." u'Big Mistake!!!! We had a party of 6 and was surprised it did not take long to get a seat; however seating is exceptionally crowded. Took 15 minutes just to get tea and coke in very small glasses. Salsa and chips were good but extremely small basket and no refills. Took at least 30 minutes to get lunch items which were $10.95 each. Most of us did not like the food but no one inquired if there was a problem and none of us were even close to being full. Shocked that the bill was $119.00. Service was very poor.' u"Great ambience amazing margaritas and a fun crowd (usually with a lot of gay people and gay waiters which gives it a really welcoming and inclusive environment). The food is pretty decent and the service is usually great. It's most famous for its margaritas especially the mama margarita. Usually has really good music too." u"Best Mexican food I've ever had. (I ordered a chicken chimichanga). Took about five minutes to get the food. Staff very attentive. Decor is dark but super cool ambiance! Even when they sang happy birthday I feel like it was sincere lol. Overall amazing amazing experience. Thanks for making my birthday one to remember!" u"I love this place. I've been there with many different people - family girlfriend coworkers and we all loved it. Good music and vibes. Service is always friendly and fast. And most important their margaritas OMG please do me a favor and have one and I promise you after this place you will never go anywhere else for ritas :) I will go back there yes it was a bit dark loud and busy but that's perfect for a night out! Definitely recommend." u"Look at that dog out front not sure if he's a guestOnce I had been told no dogs allowed outsideWhen entertaining my own who is my friend that is the bestHaving passed by again we remained intriguedThe next time we dined without el perroThough saw ayy chihuahua sitting next to our tableConfused I must confessHowever I missed the colorful scene insideThe food was quite tasty too good just like the restNext time won't you let me bring my friend to enjoy a burrito too?" u"Worst restaurant to possibly stumble into. Didn't my plan to come here at first but the restaurant next door has a long wait so my friends and I decided to settle for this place. We were seated right away. We ordered food. The manager came and said that their policy was that everyone at the table had to order a dish that was a minimum of $9.95. This is the most absurd policy ever. And so we asked to leave and the waiter snatched the complimentary chips and salsa so quickly off our table that I thought it evaporated into thin air. I will not be coming back here for their overpriced Mexican food anyway." u"Came here with some friends before a night out and I fell in love with it! The whole inside of the restaurant is decked out with pinatas and there's Latin music playing throughout. It was pretty crowded when we went on Thursday night but that's a given anywhere in NYC. I ordered the shrimp with rice and cheese which was perfectly seasoned and flavored. The cheese was slightly burnt that was the only complaint but other than that their margaritas are out of this world and the service was spectacular. I would definitely come back here again!" u"It's a nice a place you can sit down for a meal and lose some hearing because of the loud music. \xa0I liked their service friendly and attentive staff. The ambiance is a bit too dark and too much use of colored lights. The wall murals are unique. The nachos were good the mains were filling. Fish tacos were also tasty. It's a good place for Mexican food. Just not too fond of the volume." u'This is a smaller restaurant that offers big taste! From the moment you walk in you see the bar on the left and seating on the right. Seating is tight but worth the squeeze.The food... Good portions great sauces and amazing taste. Fairly priced as well. Good service all around. We will be back next time in town.' u'I have been to this place like 4 times the food is great But the vive and the service is even better. There is always great music. The drinks are on point. Highly recommended for bringing ur family and show them something different. U are going to feel so comfortable here.' u"Arriba Arriba! I think I fell a little bit in love with this place. I'll start off by saying I have to come back. Anyone who knows me knows that I love me some Mexican food and a drink that will have my head leaning to the side. The drinks are a little pricey but it's worth every penny. They come in 3 sizes for the margaritas : bebe mama and papa. So yummy and lots of flavors to choose from. When you sit down you get a complimentary order of warm tortilla chips and salsa. Thank them in advance lol. I ordered the Mexican soup and a small chicken nacho. More than enough food and very tasty. My boyfriend ordered the fajitas and let's just say the plate was clean by the end of our meal. If you're looking for a quiet spot then this isn't the place for you. It can get really loud between drunk people and the music they play. It's also very dark in here lol I swear I had the flashlight from my phone on to read the menu. Other than that this is a must try place! ;)"]
41.Crisp,[u"My office (located basically across the street) ordered lunch from here today. I had a lamb on a pita and some waffle fries (we also ordered plenty of chicken pitas vegetarian options salads etc).The lamb in my pita was really delicious and cooked well - had really excellent flavor in it and reminded me a little of the falafel chain Maoz. You can tell they use really excellent quality ingredients to put things together.The waffle fries were super delicious and perfectly crispy. Ordering in is fantastic as they packaged everything really well and all of the food was clearly labels so as to avoid confusion. I probably wouldn't come here for lunch on my own as they are a tad pricey for every day work lunch but for free Friday office lunch - huzzah!" u"This place is so good for lunch! Ordering can be a little confusing though as there are two lines - one to order (right) and one to pick up (left) - so just make sure you're in the right one.I come to Crisp when I'm pretending to eat healthy so I always go for the bowls. The great thing about the bowls is you can mix the following bases - rice hummus or greens. All bowls come with a 4 falafel balls and a side of the pita. The falafel is pretty good and definitely tastes fresh but the pita is the real winner. It's so soft \xa0and always comes warm (and if you get your bowl with half greens and half hummus the pita is perfect with the hummus). My favorite bowl is the Sahara - beets carrots and a pomegranate reduction. Highly recommend if you happen to be stuck around Times Square/Midtown for lunch!" u'I have a love/hate relationship with Crisp. \xa0I usually order the Israeli salad with hummus and greens plus the chicken shwarma as extra protein. \xa0It\'s a very large lunch portion and filling.Pros- The falafel is awesome! \xa0The food is very fresh and the hot pita with the meal is delicious as well. \xa0Plus your meal is ready within minutes especially when you\'re on the go.Cons - Roughly a few months ago the "greens" in the salad were not really greens. \xa0I\'m not sure what it was but they\'ve changed their receipe where it\'s green salad. \xa0Also they were giving smaller portions off and on. \xa0I\'m not sure if it had to do with a supplier issue or management change but they\'ve improved since I\'ve last ate there.Finally I would have rated this higher but the consistantcy of Crisp has been a struggle. \xa0Maybe in the near future I\'ll change my mind but I will continue to eat at this establishment as it\'s good Mediterranean food for a great price.' u'My friend yelped Mediterranean food and this was one with the highest reviews. We walked from from west 27th to there just to try the food. It was around 12:45 when we arrived. A long line of hungry workers stood past the door which meant it must be worth the wait and money. We waited for a good 10 min before ordering. I oredered the Morocco Flatbread wrap and my friend ordered the chicken salad. For 9.50 my sandwich was huge and filling. The vegetables were tasty as well as the falafel but the best part was the naan. I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu. Perfect spot for vegetarians.' u"Crisp is a fast casual Mediterranean restaurant that mostly serves the Midtown lunch crowd on the weekdays. While the line can get long/out the door during the peak lunch hours it generally moves really fast and Crisp is very efficient and speedy at preparing the food (I think everything is pre-cooked so it's all about assembling).I have tried the Tikka Bowl which includes grilled peppers fried onions and grape tomatoes over a choice of hummus rice or greens (you can mix and match). Wheat pita and four balls of falafel are included and you can pay extra for additional proteins like chicken beef lamb fish or veggie proteins.Because the falafels are pre-fried vs. fried after the order is submitted they are not scorching hot but they are still crispy. I like their slightly thicker consistency of the hummus and the combo of rice greens and hummus is great. The best part of the Tikka bowl was the creamy curry mango coconut sauce." u'I\'ve visited Crisp twice in the last two weeks - it\'s actually very very satisfying and a delicious lunch option in the crappy Times Square area. \xa0It\'s also very convenient for work. \xa0During lunch rush the lines look pretty ridiculous but the wait is actually very reasonable and you can be in and out within 10-15 min max. \xa0On the right you wait to place your order. \xa0On the left you wait for your number to be called to pick up your order. \xa0The logistics and layout of this store is quite weird especially for the line up process. \xa0I wouldn\'t recommend eating inside the restaurant as you\'ll likely be hovered over by someone waiting in line.The bowls which is what I usually get comes with greens rice and hummus (or a mix of all or two). \xa0It comes with falafel but you can choose to add other proteins for an additional cost.I would give Crisp 5 stars for food but the first time I came here I ordered an Acropolis Bowl (Greek Salad) and by the time I got back to the office I realized what I actually got was the Arugula Salad - and I\'m not a big fan of arugula and I really hated the roasted semi-sweet red peppers and goat cheese. \xa0The Acropolis (Greek salad) bowl is where it\'s at. \xa0I get the hummus on the side as to not to "mushify" my entire meal which is what happened when I got the hummus in the bowl the first time around. \xa0I like dipping my pita in it separately. \xa0I got the Greek salad over more greens. \xa0I haven\'t ever gotten rice here. \xa0The salad and feta/olives/tomatoes/yogurt dressing were amazing and very satisfying. \xa0The falafel here isn\'t the best I\'ve had in NYC but the ones they serve up here are very good - freshly made and fried to order. \xa0The hummus is also good here. \xa0The whole wheat pita is made in house and excellent - still hot and fresh by the time I returned to the office 7 minutes away.Crisp is definitely my go-to spot when I don\'t eat at the cafe at work.' u'This place has gotta be one of the best spots for falafel. They even have soy meat vegetarian options which provides a greater variety for vegetarians to choose from.' u"I usually go to Maoz for my salad bowls but since my boyfriend isn't the biggest fan of that spot we decided to check out Crisp instead. While a bit far from his office we still arrived before the lunch rush. Which was a good thing considering there was a line three people wide all the way to the door by the time we left. He ordered a crispy chicken burger with waffle fries and I got a hummus & greens Israeli salad bowl with shawarma. They have to-go and to-stay options. We had managed to get two of the few seats in the joint and while the environment was a tad loud it was better than braving the cold and trying to eat our food somewhere else. Firstly my salad bowl. I do regret ordering hummus and greens. A rice and greens bowl probably would've been more up my alley. While the hummus was tasty it far overpowered my veggies not only in flavor but also in size. It made the texture of the bowl a bit boring and while I enjoyed the taste of everything it was just soft on soft on soft. Although I did appreciate the piping hot pita that accompanied my dish I wound up unable to finish all of it and had half the order leftover. My boyfriend said his chicken was surprisingly tasty with a great crunch and lots of flavor. Kind of surprising for a place that seemed to be pushing out a lot more hummus than burgers.I do recommend Crisp whether or not you're into healthy food. It's tasty it's cheap and it's creative. Just don't go during the lunch rush." u'It\'s always a good day when I get to treat my self to a lunch as good as Crisp. They make great food have a nice variety of options and offer quick service. The lunch crowd gets extremely overwhelming so I would recommend ordering for pickup on Seamless. If you\'d rather not just a note that the line on the right is for ordering/paying and the line on the left is for picking up your ordered food Personally I always default to the bowls since they\'re not as messy as some of the other options and the customization options are great. Once you decide which bowl you want you can choose greens rice hummus or any combination of the three as a "base" for your bowl. Regarding the toppings the falafel is always fresh and delicious as are their other protein toppings (mock veggie meat kabobs really took me by surprise). Most importantly this is probably the only place in Midtown that offers waffle fries!' u'I am torn between giving Crisp 3 or 4 stars. The food is amazing... Delicious (pretty) cheap and (mostly) healthy.The good:Like I said above the food is amazing. I used to get the Backyard with Crispy Chicken or Black Bean Burger depending on if I was yo-yo dieting or not. If I was not on a diet on that particular day I would get the side of Waffle Fries. It has thankfully been a long time since I ordered anything crispy nor fried. I have since switched to the Mexican Flatbread Creation. It comes with Falafel as the main protein but I switch it to the Black Bean Burger. Nothing is wrong with the Falafel I just prefer the burger. The bad:The online ordering system is a little weak. I will place an order and walk to the restaurant at the specified time on the e-receipt. Here is the downfall: \xa0you check in with the cashier(s) they say "we\'ll let them know you\'re here" and then you still wind up waiting 5-10 minutes. The one time it was so busy that I didn\'t check my order and they gave me the completely wrong one. I work a couple of blocks away so I didn\'t go back to switch the order. So sorry random person but your Parisian Burger was delicious.' u"Today I went to Bryant Park for the Back to the Future film festival. \xa0I got there at 6 pm and was about to go crazy when I found out the film was actually starting at 8 pm. \xa0I was craving food and so I decided to go on a food hunting adventure with three friends while the rest of the group remained. \xa0(The rest of them brought food and I didn't get the memo) \xa0I was delighted to find this place on Yelp. \xa0It's located about a block away from Bryant Park. \xa0I was happy with the look of the place the simplicity the great customer service and the phenomenal food. \xa0I ordered the mushroom bowl which consisted of grilled portabellas grilled onions & olive oil with hummus rice and chicken & lamb shawarma. \xa0All of this added up to only around $11. \xa0The prices listed are very reasonable. \xa0I've never tasted anything as filling and different as this before; absolutely orgasmic.Would I recommend this place? \xa0Definitely. \xa0Would I come back again? \xa0Yes next time I come I'm dragging my squads here to try this amazing Mediterranean food even if they have no legs or arms." u'Saw the yummy photos on yelp and I had to go here! Def a good place for lunch if youre around the 42/bry park area. When I first got here ~ 1pm the line was super super long l I was almost scared off. Ofc this was expected because it was around lunch time. Nevertheless I decided to give it a try. The place has two lines - one for ordering one for picking up. To my surprise it moved really quickly and I wanna say I only had to wait ~10-15 min! I got a baja bowl with greens&hummus&falafel. The falafel was nice and crunchy and the baja sauce added to the flavor. I also really liked the green sauce it came with on the side. I do wish the proportion of greens:hummus was more even though. They were very very generous with hummus (which was delish) but I wanted more greens. Still a great place to get some togo lunch!!' u'Not my first choice for a good falafel but much better than all the others around .Fresh salads and great fries .' u"That's actually a lot of food. Turns out I don't like falafel very much but that's because I am mostly a carnivore." u"Another good place for lunch. expect a huge line because this place is too much in demand. but the food is really fresh and they have good service. I ordered Mexican Flatbread and it was really good. it's also famous for its falafels!" u"Love this place - super close to my office so very convenient to pick up for lunch. Long lines and probably confusing if you're going for the first time. When you walk in there's a line to your right where you place your order. Then you walk back out to line up on the left to wait for your order.Everything is made to order so you get everything fresh :) I love watching the lady in the back making the falafels...she's like a machine back there!!! I used to get their regular flatbread creations but I found that to be too difficult to eat (aka everything falls out and you make a mess everywhere). Now I just get the bowl which is the same thing but deconstructed in a sense I guess! When you get a bowl the menu can be somewhat confusing but 1) pick your base (can be rice hummus greens or all 3!) 2) pick your main topping (usually the same as the flatbread creations) and 3) pick your premium toppings. The steak/salmon items are really worth it at only +$2.75 and they cook it to perfection. Ask for medium rare on the steak!!!My favorite is the Africa - Habanero peanut sauce ginger corn salad sweet potato chips and greens. Lovely sweet peanut-y flavors that tastes healthy yet decadent. Falafels are always included in the price of the bowl and are always crispy on the outside and warm/fluffy on the inside!Great healthy and yummy lunch spot in midtown!" u"Went for the first time today - delicious! Solid falafel bowl spot with quick service. I ordered the Acropolis bowl a classic Greek salad with hummus falafel and pita bread. The bread was nice and warm. The falafel was light and crisp. Feeling nice and full after lunch!Although service is fast and efficient customer service could've been a bit warmer. Cashier wasn't very willing to help me figure out the menu." u'LUNCH DELIVERY REVIEW.Loved Crisp. Was looking for a moderately healthy and efficient lunch delivery option for a group of seven people. Easy online ordering system. Asked them to label each order by name and they did so by placing everything in individual bags and labeling those. Everything was really delicious. Great falafel. Awesome naan.Love that they are vegetarian friendly! In addition to the falafel you could get mock veggie meat as your protein selection. Highly recommend!' u"Have to update my review after ordering from here on Corporate Seamless. The food's great but how good is it if your group order comes 45 minutes late? They haven't dispatched our orders on time for 12:30pm arrival in the last few weeks. Not sure if they're too busy or what but don't order from corporate seamless if you actually want to eat together with your coworkers. Go to the actual place if you want to try it!" u"One of the best options in the food desert that is Midtown West. It's more of a grab and go type of place even if there is seating. It's perfect for anyone that works in the area. Here's a highlight reel:1. DAMN good falafel. Probably the best option in this part of Manhattan.2. HUGE portions. It's easy to slip into a food coma.3. That lunch rush is real. Go either at 11:30am or 1:15pm. Then you can avoid the lines.4. Try all the flavors. Each thing is really unique so I recommend branching out.5. Catering can take forever. If you're doing an office order be prepared to wait.One note: I'm not a huge fan of the pita. It's a texture thing. I'm really here for the combinations of falafel."]
9.Sake Bar Hagi,[u'Awesome place for cheap drinks! My friend and I shared a bottle of nigori and a pitcher of beer they don\'t have happy hour but their prices are better than most happy hours I\'ve seen in the area! Definitely a steal.The food is diverse and great!! I didn\'t get to try too much of the cuisine but from what I did have I have confidence in the rest of the food there! A very lively and fun "hole in the wall" kind of place; the atmosphere was fun and good authentic. Two thumbs up!!' u"Where do I start? With the food? Scallop mushroom appetizers were fine but way too expensive for what they were. Ramen burger was pathetic and lacked flavor. The yaki udon on the other hand had a very strange and pungent flavor. After a couple of bites I had to stop. I couldn't stomach whatever sauce they used. It was supposed to be the yaki udon sauce but I've had that before and it never tasted like that. The omusoba was stuffed with ginger and soaked with oil. Also inedible. Now the service ignored and neglected for the most part. Couldn't even get our bill. After we handed our waiter a credit card he took it away and didn't bring anything back. He walked passed us several times and we had to ask for the card back. He then informed us that there was a problem with the machine and it would take a couple of minutes. Well isn't that something you should have told us earlier on? Also we noticed that other tables received wet wipes upon being seated but we did not." u"After waiting over 40 minutes with a friend we were finally seated and excited to try the food here. I had high expectations since there have been a lot of good reviews for the place. However in the end my friend and I were kind of disappointed in the quality of the food. I've been to a lot of Japanese bar food restaurants/izakayas in New York and this is probably one of my least favorite. My friend and I tried the uni sashimi which I would not recommend. The uni was not fresh at all. We also had skewers which came out to be super dry. The sauteed pork belly dish was too salty. Overall the food was just mediocre and definitely not worth the wait. Probably won't be coming back again." u"This was the only decent place open in the wee hours after we were at a bar. The food was decent i give you that but the service was horrible and it wasn't even full. We had to catch the attention of the waiter to place order we had to wait too long for our food and the check." u"I don't mind getting a little tongue in cheek ... as long as it is tender thin beef tongue in my cheeks ... dancing past my lips and taste buds.  \xa0The first slip of the tongue at Sake Bar Hagi was love at first bite. The second order of thinly sliced Gyutan \u725b\u30bf\u30f3 confirmed this was true love while the third order of $7.50 thinly-sliced tender beef tongue means I love moo way too much.So loosen up with a pitcher of Sapporo Beer a bottle of Sake or both.Then get tongue tied with as many orders of the thin tender Gyutan Beef Tongue as your own tongue desires.Mix in some skewers of Yakitori and Kushiyaki. My recommendations at Saki Bar Hagi include: * Tori \u9d8f Chicken $2.00 * Shishito Peppers \u7345\u5b50\u5510 $2.00 * Aspara Bacon \u30a2\u30b9\u30d1\u30e9\u30d9\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3 Bacon-wrapped Asparagus $3.00 * Reba \u30ec\u30d0\u30fc Chicken Livers $2.00 * Kawa \u3068\u308a\u304b\u308f Crispy Chicken Skin $2.50 * Tsukune \u3064\u304f\u306d Chicken Meatballs $2.00This underground bar is small crowded loud and funky. I enjoyed it but it was the first time Sake Bar Hagi slipped me the tongue ... beef tongue ... that I fell in love. It's called Gyutan \u725b\u30bf\u30f3 in Japan and it's called tender and terrific in Sake Bar Hagi." u"The food was so mediocre. But I can see if you're drinking up a storm it can be a tad bit more satisfying. Ordered the pork belly with kimchi the tendon and the takoyaki. All were kind of terrible. The tempura rice bowl was especially greasy and oily. Better to hit up a Korean fried chicken place if you need some late night food. Very disappointed. Really was hoping for a better experience." u'There was a long wait (about 45 minutes) with only 2-4 seats available if you choose to wait by the host down the narrow stairs. Once we got in I was pleased with the menu. It had a great assortment of dishes (mostly Japanese and Korean) and even larger assortment of drinks.We decided to order the katsu-don steak with white rice and bean sprouts Fiji Apple wine Yuzu sake Plum beer Melon spiked milk drink (tasted like cough syrup) and sour plum drink. The food was filling and delicious. The appetizer we ordered earlier was sashimi and it was super fresh. For dessert we had the Milli green tea cake which was very thick but pairs well with a milk-based drink.The waiters are friendly and checked on us from time to time. They generously refilled our water glasses and would ask us for any additional drinks or refills. No strong complaints since everything ran smoothly and the food/drinks were just great.' u"If you're looking for a light dinner this is not the best choice. If you're looking for good bar food this is a decent choice.Space - You have to go down a flight of stairs to reach the restaurant. The basement level location may be why ventilation was poor because my pores were definitely clogging up. Sea Urchin - This was my first time eating sea urchin and it reminded me of oysters. I liked it but its creamy texture is not for everyone.Takoyaki - The octopus in the center was cooked nicely but the batter on the outside was softer than I would've liked it and could've had more flavor.Japanese Seafood Pancake - Yum! Great crisp on the outside and the seafood was fresh. Downside was that it was drowning in mayonnaise." u"What's the hype about?? Arrived at 530 when they opened at 5 and it was already a 20-30 min wait.. Food was mediocre. I've def had better Japanese food. The price was decent at least. Service subpar. If there's a wait don't wait." u"I came in here randomly because my friend was craving crepe cakes at midnight and Lady M was closed... Such a good find! We ended up getting much more than just their green tea cupcakes - because their menu was tempting us with variety of Japanese bar food. We had their salmon sashimi seaweed salad and a uni rice dish (forget the name!). The sashimi was fresh and tasted great. The uni rice dish was served in a broth with egg and scallions -- also great but I think I prefer the regular rice bowls without the soup. One thing that made me laugh real hard on their menu: pizza tempura! Whhhhaaaaa???? Lol. Yes. They have fried pizza if you ever want to give yourself a heart attack. Hahaha! It was really late at night and we were getting food after having already eaten dinner so we stayed away from ordering it but I will have to try it one day after not eating anything for the whole day! Lol. May be I'll browse through the reviews to see if anyone has tried it...!!" u'This is a great sushi restaurant with other Japanese options. Loved the rolls here. Highly recommended. Fresh fish. Fun atmosphere.' u'Gluten-Free ReviewWanted to find a place on our first night in NYC and decided to check out spots that one of my favorite travel shows "Anthony Bourdain" has visited and he has came here and decided this would be the place especially since they were open till like midnight. Being from Texas the entire foodie feel of this place was epic walking down the stairs to the abyss of culinary genius of master sushi chefs and sake everywhere was an awesome first impression. Ordered a bottle of sake which was real dry and our fault for not knowing enough but none the less wasn\'t to bad. I also informed him of my gluten allergies and he acknowledged I think without speaking English it\'s really hard to tell whether they understand you or not. The menu is HUGE overwhelming in fact it\'s hard to pick especially being gluten free so after 20 minutes I told him this that this that check with chef and apparently they do not carry gluten-free soy sauce which is a sham for being such a big city it\'s pathetic. I also couldn\'t order any skewers most of the sushi that had been soy glazed so I ended up getting a bowl of garlic rice. It was good none the less and the lady enjoyed her skewers. I just wish places like this would get on board and carry gluten-free soy sauce it\'s not hard to keep one bottle in stock for a patron such as myself also to make anything the same just use the GF sauce instead... I\'m not looking for a major change here. It would be 5 stars if they caried it but maybe next time. Otherwise I\'d probably never come back nor recommend to any of my glutenator yelp friends. However if your not allergic to wheat then this place is probably an epic dream paradise it\'s pretty awesome.' u'First visit - 2011 ; Second visit - 2016 Still good. Outstanding. Took a few folks here and we ate everything. \xa0I would recommend the following.Soft Shell Shrimp - Lightly fried sea salted. Curry Meat Balls - Fantastic. \xa0Meaty goodness and fragrant Japanese curry flavors.Agedashi Tofu - Soul foodChicken Kaarage - Japanese fried chicken done perfectlyLike 5 years ago the place is packed. Be prepared to wait. Service is so-so. \xa0The servers can be short with you.' u"Delicious food with a great atmosphere! I loved the Takana Meshi- the combination of pork plus pickles was great and the sauce on the rice was very flavorful. Also really enjoyed the a Squid Teriyaki and Mentaiko Fried Rice-both were very tasty. Everything was reasonably priced and I'll definitely go back and try more things!" u"I had the winter special eel rice and indeed it was a hearty heart warming meal for winter! I feel stuffed at the end of the meal and unable to finish all the rice. The eel rice dish has plenty of eel in it--two layers one for you to eat with the sauced rice plain and a second layer of eel to eat with pickles with or drizzle in all the seaweed flavoring lastly pour in tea here you have 3 ways to enjoy the meal. The service was meh the place is packed and we didn't see the server during most of our meal time we wanted to add in appetizer squid but never get to talk to the server after the initial order. The tables are cramped there's very little space in between different tables but it's okay for a drink/food to go with beer kind place. The foot thing is the light is not dim in this place like most izakaya places I'd like to see what's in my plate please.e" u"Fantastic underground (literally) find that reminds me of the izakayas in Tokyo. Came in a touch before 6:00 and were seated immediately. Note that by 7:00 there wasn't an open seat in the house. We ordered a nice mess of goodies:Saut\xe9ed squid - tasty squid good enough to order again. Wasabi shumai - nose clearing spice with enough porky flavor to slightly tame the heat. Soft shell whole fried shrimp - a must get if they have it. Same concept as soft shell crab; just dig it shell and all and suck the brains out when you are done. Saut\xe9ed pork belly with garlic sprouts - get this. No wait. Get two orders of this. This was amazing. Hard to describe really but the flavors are spot on. Yakitori (chicken skins chicken meatballs chicken thighs and shishito peppers - all solid staples as good as you should hope to find at an izakaya vs a yakitori restaurant. Spicy cod roe rice - this was ok. Basically a white rice spiked with seafood flavor from the spicy cod. No need to get this one. All of the above plus 4 beers a small sake and two glasses of negori sake to finish the night came out to roughly $100 before tip. Great value for a great meal." u"I wasn't aware this place was so popular. Mr. Joy and I wandered in here on Thanksgiving. Not only were they open but it was bustling. Luckily we only waited a few minutes for a table.We ordered ...Sour Yuzu Sake: tastes like a sweet & sour soda.Age Takoyaki: ($6.50) has the familiar octopus filling with a crunchy exterior.Kushi Mori A set ($12) - Shishito peppers pork belly chicken Washu beef chicken meatballs. We also added chicken skin ($2.50) and duck ($4). The pork belly was fatty and delicious and the chicken skin fatty and crunchy. The rest were not bad.Mentai Pasta ($9.50) - spaghetti with spicy cod fish roe: This was my first time trying this particular noodle dish. Everyone seems to rave about this dish and I do not disagree with consensus. The cod roe gives a bit of a tangy flavor and is only slightly spicy while the rich and creamy taste quells the fire. It all meshes well into very satisfying bites.The restaurant was pretty cramped but the food was good." u"I won't be coming back here or to the much superior 46th street location. The service is just appalling. This is my third time waiting 45 minutes for ramen. And no there was absolutely nothing special about it that warranted this kind of unpardonable wait time." u"When in NYC you have to eat late night snacks. I found out about this on Yelp and dragged my hubby there. The place was packed on a Thursday night at 11:00pm that's how you know it's good lolWe ordered a bunch of skewers and the frog leg everything tasted soooo good! I wish there's a place like this in ATL" u"Surprised the place was still bustling at 11:30pm on a Monday night. \xa0Guess it shouldn't be much of a shocker since it's located in prime tourist area (yes I'm one of them). \xa0Luckily we didn't have to wait for a table. \xa0Since it's a late night snack for us we didn't go all out.Skewers:We'd ordered a couple skewers each. \xa0Hubby went with lamb and duck. \xa0I went with chicken meatballs and grilled chicken. \xa0My hubby liked his skewers \xa0 As for mine the chicken was rather bland (could have used a bit more seasoning) and the chicken meatballs was a tad bit mushy for me.Other items:Uni sashimi - wasn't really fresh there were some dried up corners (eeks)Fried chicken gizzards - an abundance of deliciously fried chicken gizzard morselsJapanese seafood pancake - like a deconstructed takoyaki ball - similar texture and flavorDefinitely remembered the place being better the first time around but still not a bad alternative if you are in the area."]
46.Alfie’s,[u'Went here with some friends to grab a bite to eat on a weeknight. It was a little after 9 but the place was still pretty crowded and we were able to grab one of the last remaining tables.For my meal I decided to go with the turkey burger with a side salad. The side salad was actually a very decent size and the burger was excellent--tender juicy and paired well with all of the ingredients.Overall this place was wayyyy better than I was expecting and I would definitely come back here again. The pricing is alright--about typical for the area but the service was a bit aloof at times. Nevertheless it was an unexpectedly good meal.' u"Lunch/brunch review:My boyfriend and I came here for lunch before food shopping one Sunday after walking by a few times and being interested. It's a cute bar inside with cozy decor and relatively clean given its a Sunday. We both ordered burgers mine was a turkey burger and it was okay and the side salad that came with was pretty under-dressed and bland...pretty boring really. My boyfriend got the Alfies Burger that comes with a fried egg for brunch - it was delish and his sweet potato fries were really really good. The food came out on circular boards which I thought was creative definitely different in a good way so that was a plus.I'd venture to say their sides are pretty good based on ours and what we saw but I suppose we came in thinking it was more than a burger spot or maybe we tried to make it more than it is. Either way the burger was the way to go! I am not sure id come back other than maybe for a burger & booze brunch but maybe we will give it another go!" u'Great brunch in HK. Got the farmers omelette and it was really yummy! Every brunch entree comes with a free drink- such a treat! Service is great and super friendly. Came with 6 people on a Sunday at 11.45am and got sat right away. Such a good neighborhood staple. Solid food and great service. Also a good spot for a happy hr drink after work! Great beers on tap and good bar food.' u"I had the Alfie's burger with sweet potato fries. The party was meaty but a bit dry. The sweet potato fries were greasy and soggy. \xa0I also found the service to be bad even using NYC standards. Not a place I'd go out of my way to eat at." u"Late Friday night trying to find a kitchen open late that didn't have a barrage of drunk people swimming around. Not only did Alfie's have their full menu but happy hour drafts till 4am.Prices are a bit high for bar food so at least tried to get something interesting. Decided on the Pastrami on a Pretzel ($16) with sweet potato fries and a draft beer ($5). The sandwich itself is disappointingly small and the bun is greasy from the oil or juices the filling is cooked in. Meat is pretty good and went well with the beer but can't say it's worth the price tag. Sweet potato fries are thick and made well; plus they give a lot to compensate for the tiny sandwich. Service here is fine for late night and not too crowded as well. Would come back here for the good beer list but probably not the food." u"Just before heading over to see a play we originally decided to go to B Side Pizza and watch some football. Unfortunately B Side didn't have TV's but they did recommend we go to Alfie's. Of all the places to watch a game I'm not sure why they chose Alfie's but it was a great choice nonetheless. Just in time for brunch which is all you can order around noon time on a Saturday. I was starved and not sure if I wanted to give up watching the game to go back and get a pizza. Glad I stayed. Great craft beer on draught. Nice happy hour specials. The brunch entrees include a choice of a Bloody Mary or Mimosa. I decided to get the Lobster Benedict which was loaded with chunks of lobster meat. Not just from the claw but also some tail meat included as well. Quite a generous portion with a tasty salad and sweet potato fries on the side. For around $20 I'd say it was quite reasonable. The staff was very friendly and the clientele seemed to be well dressed millennial foodies. I chose the Bloody Mary which was served with 3 olives and a slice of jalapeno." u"Came here for brunch on a Saturday and it was excellent. Every meal comes with a FREE bloody mary or mimosa - the bloody mary was good quality too! We split the zucchini pancakes and pulled pork benedict. Both were great and under $17! They have some outdoor seating too.One of the best deals for a weekend brunch in the area. I'd definitely come back!" u"The Bloody Mary here = 5 stars. Hell 10 stars. As many stars as you can give. A Bloody Mary that's lacking in the horseradish department always makes me sad and the spicy BM at Alfie's is full of it and is what dreams are made of. It was the best I've had in a very very long time.We stopped in for an early lunch on a weekday and it was pretty empty - it filled up a little later but I'm thinking that weekend brunch is when it gets busy. Their brunch menu looks so great but unfortunately they don't serve it during the week. Lunch it was!My lunch date had the mussels in a fragrant broth of Alfie's ale garlic shallots chives and cream. It's served in a HUGE bowl and could definitely be shared. I couldn't decide on one thing so I ordered the wagyu beef sliders and the pan roasted cauliflower. The sliders were good but surprisingly a little bit dry and tough. The cauliflower was a-ok but I would make different choices next time.Worth it for the Bloody Mary alone! Definitely stop by when in the neighborhood." u"I came for brunch and had a great time! First of all the bloody Mary was STRONG and delicious. Can't taste the alcohol at all. Just the right amount of spice with a chain of olives on top.1. Caramel French toast: The French toast were more like thick pancakes that had a little bit of texture in them. The banana slices laid over were a great addition. Highly recommend this dish. 2. Bacon: Freshly done they came out with the bacon fat still sizzling on them.3. Avocado toast: Comes with two poached eggs and a salad on the toast. Side of potatoes. Everything tasted fresh. Nothing was over salted.4. Pulled pork sandwich: Yummy! Hard to screw up a dish with pulled pork sunny side up eggs and salad. And they didn't because this dish was delectable.5. Steak and eggs: The steak was good but maybe could have been slightly more rare. The plate comes with eggs salad and potatoes. I think it's a great brunch deal!Ambience is simple bar/gastropub. They had some Halloween and fall decorations up when I was here." u"Came here for brunch with friends on a Saturday and it was great! We had never heard of their brunch before but i'm so glad we went. For starters you get a free drink with brunch! Who can complain about that? The menu has a lot of options including LOBSTER EGGS BENEDICT (highly recommended) and delicious avocado toast. The eggs benedict came with really yummy potatoes and a side salad. The portion was perfect and I licked my plate clean. I would definitely come back to try their lunch/dinner." u"I came here with a group of friends one night and had a great time. The bartender was super chill and let me sample a couple draft beers (they have an AWESOME selection) before buying one. I like the feel of the place. It's dim-lit and cozy. I would definitely come again if I'm ever in the area!" u'Nice place to stop and have a cold beer. \xa0I had the Montauk IPA. \xa0The cauliflower dish was delicious for a mid day snack. \xa0Nice atmosphere and knowledgeable staff. \xa0Will come back for sure' u"Came to this bar before a show on a Saturday night. Was busy when we walked in but we were seated immediately. Our waters came fast but our waitress didn't show up for about 10 minutes after we sat down and by that time we were ready to order. We ordered beer battered pickle fries grilled cheese and tomato soup Mac & Cheese French fries and a house salad. The beer battered pickle fries and regular French fries came out quickly and were delicious. I would order again. Our dinners took long to come out as well as getting refills on our drinks because the waitress spent all her time in the corner behind the bar speaking with the bartender. However the dinners were delicious as well. I think the grilled cheese was the best grilled cheese I've ever tasted. We ate quickly because we had a show to get to but the waitress still never came to our table. We waited for our check for another 20 minutes until finally someone in my party walked to the back of the bar and got her to tell her we wanted the check. Another 5 minutes passed and some girl who wasn't our waitress dropped the check off. The only good service we received was from the host. He was very sweet and friendly. I would go back." u'This place is great! It reminds me of pony bar but with an awesome food menu. While I had to eat the kale salad (it was yummy) the burgers and soft pretzels with cheese dip around me looked heavenly. The beer selection is deep and on point complimented but an attentive wait staff tables for small groups or seats at the bar. I will be back for sure. Like a lot.' u"What went wrong? Well service was great. The place inside is cute. We sat outside and enjoyed the view. So what went wrong? The food was 2 stars across the board. My husband was just happy they had beer. I was starving and the food still tastes blah. Avoid the cheese curds they taste like a bad soggy cheese toast. They are super airy and the cheese is just dry. Fried calamari and shrimp is doable. They should use that batter to on the cheese curds. I was craving fried chicken so I went ahead and ordered the chicken and honey. It was so-so. It came with a flavorless cole slaw and corn. My husband and friends ordered sandwiches which they didn't like either and I doubt their worth ranting about. Caramel chocolate pudding is a seriously boring ass desert. I was turned off by it's lack of flavor.The food wasn't good and it wasn't cheap." u"I love it when I don't have to wait to get brunch in NYC especially during the frigid winter. I love it even more when each entree comes with a morning cocktail of either a bloody mary or mimosa.There is ample seating here but a lot of the table seating gets taken early leaving the high tops for up to parties of four. It didn't matter for us since we were all tall enough to sit on the high tops and I had a perfect view of the TV to catch the NFL divisional game. We made it super easy for our waitress by ordering the steak and eggs over easy and medium rare steak. The eggs and steak came out just the way we ordered them and I liked how they pre cut the steak for us into bite sized pieces. The food was done very well and definitely hit the spot for a good Sunday brunch. I'd definitely return for brunch and if I find myself here after midnight they have a happy hour where all drafts are $5 that seems worth checking out too." u"Went to this bar with some friends after work it's one of my coworkers go to bars. He knew the bartenders and everyone was really nice. They have a pretty extensive beer list I had a banana flavored brown beer which was really good.We also all got food which everyone loved. I had the Bulgogi sandwich; perfect combination of korean bbq flavor and delicious bar food sandwich. A couple others got the Lobster PLT which I am definitely going to try next time I go. I can't wait to go back here to try more." u"I wish I could be more descriptive about this restaurant but it's been awhile since I've been here last. \xa0I know I didn't have anything fancy as far as cocktails goes and the drinks were fine pretty standard. \xa0The party I was with did get appetizers I am pretty sure I had mac n' cheese. \xa0It was ok nothing special. \xa0May be worth checking out if you're in the area. \xa0If I am I'll definitely go back and update this review." u"Good craft beer selection. Average prices for NYC ($7-8 for most craft pint selections). 11a-8p M-F Happy Hour which has $5 wells 2 house craft beers that I didn't have and can't comment on. Also a late night happy hour that looks very good (most drafts for $5). The Wagyu sliders were very good and the chicken flat bread was ho hum." u"BEST BURGER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. Medium rare came out perfectly pink and had a great flavor. Drinks aren't bad either!Love that this place is open for most of the day and night. Service was slow and our server was less than attentive but the decent atmosphere and the food definitely made up for it."]
170.Iroha Japanese Restaurant,[u"My family loves sushi but I'm not sure we are the best judge since we tend to like the fancy rolls rather than sashimi. \xa0Having said that the sushi was good. \xa0Every bit as good and fresh tasting as the sushi we enjoy in our favorite restaurants in San Jose CA better than any of the places I've tried in LA and on par with a couple of sushi restaurants I've tried in Tokyo. \xa0The inside is not fancy with wooden tables and its a bit tight but not terrible. \xa0Service was good and presentation was better than average.Great selection of sake but I'll admit I tried one of the lower cost house options- it was great- even my wife and daughter liked it. \xa0Speaking of low cost I can't say it was low but it was essentially the same cost we pay in San Jose and since we were dining 2 blocks from Times Square I was really happy about that." u"Same owner as Sake Bar Hagi. Iroha is one of those places that my husband and I come last minute after work when we can't decide what to eat and it's too late to make reservations anywhere else. They have a less of a wait time than Hagi (located downstairs) and it's quieter (in my opinion). However the menu option is limited and it's a bit more expensive. Service is better than downstairs. They at least give you some time before clearing your plateFood is mediocre but satisfies you when you're hungry. I always rotate between the Chirashi Don Agedashi Tofu and Beef Tongue." u"Pretty standard/whatever sushi. I've never been to the restaurant but I seamless'd a spicy tuna roll and sweet potato roll from work. I ordered $65 worth of sushi with co-workers and the restaurant was so stingy when it came to giving us soy sauce. Literally they gave us one small cup...In terms of the food I'd say it's nothing special. What can you expect when you order online? Tip: Ask for extra soy sauce" u"Shocked this doesn't have a higher rating because the quality of sushi and selection of sake is great here..I've been here twice and still find that the sushi choices and quality of fish are better than elsewhere! (Even Izakaya Mew which I've been to ~5 times and was not once impressed).The Nabeyako udon had delicious chewy udon noodles and a perfectly flavored and salted broth. And the house sake itself was delicious and strong!Although there are not many tables upstairs there is seating downstairs at night. Worth the wait if any!" u"I am a huge fan of sushi. I eat it twice a week. Visiting NYC from LA where we have amazing restaurants I was surprised to find this sushi place to serve the best tasting and freshest sushi I have ever had. Why doesn't it have higher ratings? It is clean great service and a full hot dish menu as well." u"The food here was all right not anything special but it was a convenient location near Times Square. It had a variety of options. If I were go give it another chance I'd go back to try other sushi as I ordered mostly tempura and sashimi." u"Sister bar  on top of Sake Bar Hagi.You can order from Sake Bar Hagi's menu. \xa0Totally  not like the real deal izakaya. \xa0this one is more 'tame'But due to wait times you may have to settle and just have your dinner here. \xa0If possible I advise you wait for Sake Bar Hagi." u"Another odd restaurant that I totally missed in terms of reviews but dined and ordered from frequently.In short:- This place has had many incarnations but has settled into a mix of Japanese comfort food and your typical entree and sushi offerings.- The menu is huge- Overall the quality of food is pretty solid. \xa0- I'm especially a fan of the eel over rice/unagi. \xa0It's actually quite good.- The sushi here is above average- The delivery service is good. \xa0Thankfully the moron who used to always spill food in my (and apparently other people's) bags is no longer there so stuff gets to my place pretty quick and in one piece.- The price is reasonable relative to what you get.- Dessert is kind of overpriced IMOAll in all I've been dining in this place for way too long (I think since 1995 or something like that). \xa0It's changed a few times but it's still a reliable option if you're looking for a decent Japanese joint near Times Square." u"They have some good items! \xa0I love coming here for their Sansai Soba noodle soup. \xa0very soothing and comforting. \xa0mountain veggies and veggie tempura on top. \xa0healthy choice. \xa0there's also okonomiyaki yutofu all kinds of japanese izakaya foods. and the good thing is they're never really really packed. \xa0so there's usually room for you! \xa0most ppl seem to go for a few drinks and have some tapa style japanese dishes. \xa0but I go there for the soba." u'I came here to go to Sak\xe9 Bar Hagi but it wasn\'t open until 5PM so I decided to eat here with my friend for lunch. When we sat down here for lunch it was super busy. I saw the advertisement outside for a lunch special but something they didn\'t say on it was that it was to-go orders only. If you want to sit in it costs more. I got the Chirashi ($24) which was assorted sashimi over white rice. My friend got a sushi platter. The waitress asked us "is that all?" in a kind of annoyed tone and seemed more annoyed when we said yes. The Chirashi looked so good when I got it and it tasted fine as well. It filled me up too but I started to feel a little funny when I ate it. That same day my friend and I ate at a few more places in Manhattan and we always shared our food but this was the only place we didn\'t. She felt fine but as the day went on I started to feel more and more sick and then ended up getting extremely nauseated. I ended up throwing up once in a subway trash can and then again later as I was crossing the street. Not fun and never again.' u"There was nothing terrible about this place. \xa0The prices were good. \xa0But they didn't have many options where fish weren't cooked. \xa0I thought the sushi was wonderful though. \xa0I noticed when walking in that there's a certain amount of time you're allowed to sit there and eat. \xa0I'm not sure if all of the city is like that but I noticed that sign while there. \xa0Our waiter looked like he was the only one serving the whole restaurant. \xa0So our drinks needed to be filled when they weren't. \xa0But our food came pretty quickly. \xa0It was alright I would try something new next time though." u'Really humble Japanese restaurant. The workers are nice. Tried to get into Sake Hagi Bar but it was too crowded so we just went next door. Their menu is extremely extensive and affordable!! Good place if you have a lot of friends that are craving different Japanese foods i.e. Sushi bentos ramen etc. I absolutely love love loved the hot plate squid!!!! So good and decently sized at just $8. I would def go back just to order that. The ramen was overly salty when we ordered it though. Stick to the squid' u"My 3rd time dinning at this restaurant and realized that it was going to be the VERY last time. The roll that was suggested to mewas flavorless and over powered by a crunchy fish toppingwhich I informed one of the dozen waitresses and waiters who was serving meshe gave me a smiletook the plate and was later charged for it. For dessertI ordered the Green Tea crepe cakewhich has been my go-to dessertbut this time around it was a flop. The slices were once bigger than what was served to me that night and the whip cream accentlacked sweetness.Not one waiter or waitress gave me an experience of proper hospitality. Their kindness seemed forcedwhile others didn't bother to cover up their dislike of customer service. I'm one to tipbut this time around the dinning experience was beyond disappointingso I decided that they didn't earn it.It gets betteras I'm exiting a petite young man chased me out side because I didn't tip..? and gave me a pathetic story that the staff doesn't get paid. I told him I wasn't satisfiedbut all that mattered to him was a tip....so as the sucker that I amjust to get him out of my faceI gave him the money. In conclusionthe food isn't worth a sentenceservice lacks and always tip or someone will chase you home." u"We had been coming here for a while because my friend loves this place but somehow every time we come it just gets worse and worse. The quality of the food has gone down enormously and every time we eat here I am more and more disappointed. The sushi no longer tastes fresh and the ramen was hard. I don't recommend this place at all." u"We were trying to go to Sake Bar Hagi which is right next to this place but we didn't make a reservation and the line was too long. This was right next to it and seemed fairly empty! Maybe a sign...Everything was pretty mediocre. The best part was the service and the winter cocktail we ordered which was basically 1/2 alcohol 1/4 hot chocolate and 1/5 whipped cream. My boyfriend's chicken teriyaki and sweet potato roll were very bland (he said I could've made better!). I ordered the winter special ramen which came out with a pot of boiling broth and the stuff you put into the pot yourself. As the pot was boiling the whole time It was very difficult to eat and the pot was too small to hold all the material (but a big portion at least!). At the end everything had been boiled into oblivion and the noodles were disintegrating. At least it wasn't crowded for being in Times Square so we had a leisurely experience before our Broadway show! Needed that time too as it took me forever to actually eat my boiling dish." u'Food was great so was the dessert. Due to the packed \xa0atmosphere the service was a little slow. Good portions for a good price. But overall really liked it especially compared to the authentic food I can find in my Japanese grandmothers house.' u"This review is for delivery time!! Quoted a 15-25min delivery which is the ONLY Reason I ordered from here compared to my usual place- so far it has been an hour and ten minutes and still nothing! Low and behold I found many similar reviews online that they lieAbout delivery time!! I'm hangry and annoyed now. Thanks a lot" u"Really good sushi and yakitori!! \xa0The chicken wing and shrimp and chicken thigh is my favorite!! When ordering yakitori (meats on stick) you may have to wait a little while especially for the shrimp surprisingly since it should cook so fast \xa0 management is very nice and they have cheap wines!! Good alternative to sake bath ago when it's closed" u"I love this japanese resto near my hotel it's actually better than Sapporo. The staff is really nice. The food is really great. The price is ok. :)" u'3 stars because the fish looks relatively fresh - although the color of the tuna is questionable. $26.00 for a sashimi deluxe set that I picked up. Comes with miso soup salad and steamed rice. They forgot to give me the salad and the rice -- got the miso soup which is laughably small.']
162.Mother Burger,[u"Awesome place to get cheap frozen daiquiris. The blue lagoon daiquiri was the best among all that I tried.I also ordered a mango daiquiri but the waitress got me a daiquiri that was orange-ish in color and nowhere tasted like mango so I think it was strawberry or something which I don't really like that much but who cares when it comes to frozen drinks! :D" u'This place is located in the same outdoor plaza as the Mexican place Blockheads (same owners). Thus the biggest plus of this place is the large outdoor seating they share. Now on to the food. The burgers here were good but nothing special. Their burger patties are actually hand made which is a huge plus and juicy. However their burgers are pretty small. Fairly priced though. A burger with fries is in the $10 to $13 range.Their french fries were very nice and crispy.It seems that they make most of their money off alcoholic drinks. Like Blockheads they also serve margaritas in addition to beers and cocktails. The drinks were mostly in the $8 to $12 range. Overall this place actually was 3.5 stars for me.' u'I had dinner at this burger place. I would have given more stars but because of what had happen I did not. Food good service ok has we had just finished and the waiter asked if we could pay and we did so because he was finish. \xa0Dishes taken away one of the hostess came over and asked us to move has they had people waiting. \xa0We could move to the other side or sit inside. I told the hostess that it was rude to ask people who just finish had the dishes taken away to move. \xa0As I looked around there was three to four tables free. \xa0I also notice that they had taken about four tables away at the other end of restaurant.I have been in the restaurant \xa0business for over 25 years and would never have a employee do this to any of our customer. \xa0I told the hostess that we would leave in about 15 minutes later and did so with out being asked if we would like dessert.Management show keep on eye on there employees they will lose more customers.' u"I've been here twice the first for just the margaritas but the second time i had food. I ate the chicken quesadilla and it was delicious. Definitely haven't had a chicken quesadilla like this ina while. Yum! Service was not bad for a friday at 4pm. I had the mango frozen margarita yum!!!!!" u"The cheap drinks are good and the nacho fries were also cheap and yummy. This place is loud though lol. I got a frozen pink lemonade margarita for $9 and nacho fries for around $7. I never heard of mother burger but apparently it's popular bc for a Wednesday night it was PACKED. My waiter was also nice and the hostess seated me quickly." u"It is getting warmer out there so you know what that means folks! Outdoor drinking! While I don't care for mother burger as a food establishment (just not my deal I'd rather eat tacos across the way) the drinks and outdoor seating are stupendous! The plaza is a perfect place to sit and enjoy a frozen cocktail or a 40 of PBR. I usually end up here right after work when you can grab a seat still. \xa0There are two options. \xa0Sit down service with food on the right and to the left drinks only where you go and grab your own at the bar. \xa0Be forewarned you can only get one drink per person. The plaza is a fantastic spot. \xa0Airy sunny and fairly quiet. \xa0It is located between the two entrances of the new world stages so come grab a bite and a drink before a show. \xa0As I mentioned before I am not a huge fan of the food. \xa0It is salty (to make you drink more) and more greasy than I would prefer. \xa0If i am hungry and no one wanted to go with me to Blockheads I generally get chicken tenders and fries. Boring but they definitely do the trick to help keep me drinking on a fuller stomach. \xa0The Nacho fries are good but are a punch in the gut.For what the place is worth I certainly always enjoy myself. \xa0The price point is higher than I'd like (cocktails are 7-9/drink) but I don't go too often that it is a big hit on my wallet. \xa0But I live closer now and the weather is getting nicer..... who knows how the summer treats my bank account. Anyway I hope to see you guys for outdoor day drinks soon!" u"This place is tiny. If you come on the weekend like I did expect to be bumped into and/or standing since there is not enough space to hold more that 30-40 people. This place is shaped like a half circle with tables all along the walls. There can't be more than 10 tables in there. My time here was fleeting thankfully. I looked at the menu and can say that this place is cheap I have not seen these prices anywhere in NYC. Can't tell you if the food was good or not though. The frozen drinks were good but the atmosphere ruined it for me.Not my cup of tea." u"Great outdoor place. Reduced a star because they didn't have my favorite frozen pink lemonade. The Jack Bac burger is really delicious. The fries are amazing. And the fry sauce is great. Margaritas are cheap and strong." u'Our servers name was Krystie it was her first day and she was amazing. It took us awhile to get a seat but hey thats normal ny stuff. The food id good bar food. The drinks are cheap as hell and good as hell it not top shelf liquor but it gets you lit. Bae was lit. Bathroom line is long as hell so dont come here to pee lolz. Bring your id cause you will need it. But again Krystie was great she kept coming to check on us and didnt rush us to leave like some other places. Outdoor seats indoor seats.' u'Bartender & drink menu = 5 stars.Waitress & food service = 2 stars.Really it all depends on what you\'re looking for. \xa0The drink menu is worth the hype; especially the margarita selections & the "bulldogs" (Corona + margarita goodness.) \xa0Happy hour is ridiculously cheap and the drinks are STRONG! \xa0A frozen margarita is $5 to add flavor is an extra $1 to upgrade to a plain grande is $8. \xa0There are also some enticing rum/margarita punch drinks but we were feeling classic. \xa0Our bartender was super friendly & attentive too. \xa0We sat there while waiting 35 minutes to be seated which was fine & anticipated as it was a Friday. \xa0However I wished we had just placed an appetizer order at the bar. \xa0The food was not worth the wait the hype or the experience.Our waitress only sort of cared. \xa0No sense of urgency or concern throughout the entire meal. \xa0We ordered guac & chips as an appetizer and then burgers a la carte. \xa0We figured we wouldn\'t need fries if we\'re stuffed from having chips right? \xa0Wrong. \xa0The guac & chips didn\'t come until I asked for them which was after our burgers were plopped down in front of us. \xa0I almost asked to cancel the order at that point but who am I kidding? \xa0We went to town on our burgers. \xa0My veggie burger was delicious but immediately fell apart & crumbled all over the table as the burgers were served on plates instead of baskets. \xa0The "barbecue" sauce that I ordered was TERRIBLE & an insult to all barbecue sauce everywhere. \xa0It was like clumpy hot sauce. \xa0*Shudders*The guac came out and really... it wasn\'t terrible but it definitely wasn\'t worth waiting for. \xa0In short: \xa0Come here for a delightful happy hour experience. \xa0Go to an actual restaurant for a decent meal.' u'Friend host and hostess made us feel welcome on this sunny afternoon.A nice recommendation by the waiter for my granola pancakes made me equally happy.$3 mimosas! and other brunch drinks. \xa0Wow. \xa0and an average brunch entree in the 7.95 and 8.95 range makes this a really nice find when you\'re caught between Hell\'s kitchen and the Theater district.Prompt and courteous service without feeling rushed and great outdoor seating to soak in the sun. (or shade)People have historically said "never eat at a place called Mom\'s" but they never said anything about "Mother" and this Mother takes care of you.' u'I love this place ! The mother burger is amazing and love the house mother sauce \xa0 great outdoor seating in the summer and the staff is always friendly. If I could eat burgers everyday and not gain weight this would be my place' u'With six empty tables outside the guy seating people would not sit me outside because I was a single. \xa0He was rude and passed up my business rather then fill an empty table of four with a hungry single... Would for sure pass on this place... Rudeness is so not cool' u"ivory and shawn are great bartenders !! (sorry if I spelled your name wrong guys) I love this place. But I believe is it is under new management. the vibe is not the same but the food and drinks are sooooooooooooooo good.Under the OLD management I would of gave it 5 STARS But now I really don't know what kind of service i'm going to get during each visit. Other than that they have burgers fries and frozen drinks \xa0CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. They also have salads and veggie burgers for the vegan. oh and they also have breakfast too! Although I cant say how it taste because I always go at night. i'm sure its good tho ! xoxo" u"I found this place to be a fantastic little retreat from the city. It's out in the middle of a courtyard yet you felt like you were anywhere but in the heart of a major city. It also definitely feels like a locals place. Clientele is mostly young hip guys & girls with the occasional business person.Wait staff was very friendly. They actually brought me the wrong item and continued to apologize the rest of the time I was there. But I was having such a fun time just sitting there soaking in the atmosphere I didn't care! Food was fresh and very tasty. Very hearty as well. It didn't look like a lot of food but by the time I was done I felt like I ate a huge feast!If I'm ever back in New York I'll definitely be returning to Mother Burger." u"Outdoor seating strong drinks cheap food. When the wait at Blockheads is ridiculous (eg. always) come across the courtyard to Mother Burger. There are 3 seating areas: 1 indoor 1 outdoor w/ table service 1 outdoor without table service. \xa0Even though there were empty tables as far as the eye can see they wouldn't seat our incomplete party.Understandable when busy annoying when not. The first hostess had us wait but the second clued us in to the option of ordering at the counter and sitting in the no table service section. \xa0Drinks are strong and reasonably priced \xa0- get the Grande size always. Food is average. Inoffensive and inexpensive it's hard to mess up a burger but not the best i've ever had." u"The best thing about Mother Burger is probably its location: in an outdoor plaza across from Blockheads (burritos etc.) and close to several theaters. It's a great spot to kill time enjoy good weather in their outdoor seating section and have a meal before or after seeing a show. The burgers and fries are decent and the pricing is very fair - Saturday and Sunday also has a pretty good brunch menu (served until 3 I think) where just about everything is under $12." u"After some drinks in a midtown bar we got into the mood for a burger and since I had never been here then why not. It was a beautiful night so we decided to sit outside. It took a little longer than usual to get a server to come take our order which wouldn't have been a big deal if I wasn't starving. I noticed their specialty is frozen drinks and I wasn't really feeling that night so I decided to go with the red sangria. I was surprised by how good my sangria was and did noticed the frozen drinks looked really good. I went with the single mother with cheese and it was tasty and well cooked. You pay extra for the fries $3 but they give you a good amount and they were crispy and seasoned. I think next time I have to try their frozen drinks." u"Outdoor seatings always gets me. Its a bit away from the touristy areas which is great for local New Yorkers.I ordered a Bacon Burger wouldn't recommend it though. The bread was too soft to hold all the toppings i ended up eating the meal with a knife and fork. But the drinks!! Frozen mags are so delicious and affordable ($7-9). And they will give you a good buzz or at least it did for me. Cant wait to return back to place for the drinks! Not so sure about the food..." u"Hands down best time at Mother Burgers this summer. Bartender Anthony was amazing very professional and attentive Made me and my friends feel right at home. The seats outside were all taken so we decided to hang inside little busy and crowded. I ordered two Grande Margaritas and a third drink I don't remember but was really delicious. For a Thursday night I had a good time and i thank Anthony and Micheal for being great Bartenders."]
55.Luke’s Lobster,[u"It's a fast food place not a restaurant with the wait staff! Inside the city kitchen food court!$44 for 2 non-alcoholic drinks 2 chips 2 X 1/2 lobster shrimp crabmeat rolls. I think it's supposed be more but they're missing some stuff like coleslaw sauce and one other kind of roll.These are very small 1/2 rolls. It filled me up but my friend is getting more food at Starbucks and coffee of course LolRolls are fine tasting but i'm not running here anytime soon." u"So $20 seems high for a lobster roll when you first order but you're definitely getting your money's worth. The meal came with a drink and chips for that price as well.The lobster roll was small but it was STUFFED with lobster so much that it was falling out with every bite. There was so much lobster in there. Tasty buttery lobster. Nothing else. You get tons of fresh lobster. The roll was buttery and toasty which allowed the lobster flavor to shine.I was impressed with the taste. The price seemed high at first but it was definitely fair for how much lobster you get. I would absolutely order it again!" u"Enjoyed the lobster roll even though half was still partially frozen. The half that wasn't was quite good. Buttery flavorful and cheap for a decent lobster roll. $20 for the roll a high end soda a pickle and chips. If it's on your New York list of to dos it shouldn't disappoint. Unless you're unlucky like me to have some of it frozen. The area itself is quite nice too." u"I have been to Luck's Lobster in City Kitchen a half dozens times and it it by far the best Lobster Roll in taste and price in Manhattan from the big names Red Hook Lobster by the Pound \xa0They always stuff your roll up with an abundance of juicy pieces.You can go for the regular Lobster Roll but they got the 'Taste of Maine' menu option with 1/2 Lobster Roll1/2 Shrimp Roll1/2 Crab Roll 2 Crab Claws for $24 that can't be beat if your taste buds want variety.The flavors were all good and it also fresh with a dressing that's nice and light and does not leave you feeling heavy eating ones of these babies and you can add chip and coleslaw too.The service is fast but you may have not find a seat right there unless you walk next door on the same floor to the ROW Hotel side which has a larger sit down area and a few other eateries." u'I give it 2 stars for average taste of lobster but I paid $37 for 2 lobster rolls no chips nor pickle nth only the rolls $37! And the rolls were literally as big as my 15 yr old sisters hand it was not worth that much.. never doing this again!' u"Tasty happy silly joy. That's what I know about eating at Luke's. Simple filling herbal pure yum factor. You just have to get a lobster roll the lobster bisque and the bag of crisps to know why Luke's has 16 joints in the area." u'Inside the Row hotel on 8th. Amongst a variety of other food options. Got the crab roll and the lobster roll. Flavorful but small. Not worth 16-20 dollars.' u"Coming into this you just have to check your cheap ass at the door and just take a deep dive into the splendor of lobster. Just accept that lobster is on the higher end of seafood and rationalize that it's not like you're going to have lobster all the time anyways :-). I ended up getting the lobster roll - soup combo which came with chips and a soda. The main star of the whole meal was the lobster roll itself. The lobster meat tasted so sweet and paired well with the buttered garlic roll. I didn't even need to throw in any sauce and I'm usually a major sauce guy. The size of the roll left me content so for those with a big appetite you might want to consider other snacks within the food court.Next time I'd probably just skip the combo itself and make room for other things at City Kitchen to diversify my tasting experience since there's so much offered to try. Thanks Luke's for letting me indulge I'll definitely be back!" u"Definitely one of the best lobster rolls I've had! Although the portion is small it's so delicious that I know I will be coming back for more. The lobster is fresh and sweet brushed with butter and seasoned perfectly with pepper. The New England clam chowder is pretty good too!Located inside the City Kitchen there are plenty of window seats to enjoy the sun while people watching!" u'A Lobster Roll is a definite splurge. So was it worth it? Yes! The little bread roll was stuffed with lobster and topped with special seasonings. I ordered the combo that came with chips and a bottle or micro soda ( mine was ginger beer).One of the cool things about this location was the seating along the window. Great for watching the busy city and people outside. I thought it was cool that they wrote down the source of their Lobster on the receipt \xa0"Cape Brenton" Located in Nova Scotia.' u"I don't know how much this place paid these other reviewers but believe me if you expect to be satisfied after paying $20 for a meal this is not the place." u"No one does a lobster roll better than Luke's plain and simple. I've been a fan since they opened years ago having lobster rolls at other restaurants and none have been able to stack up to the challenge. The only thing keeping me from eating here more regularly is the high price tag (which is probably a good thing since I can just imagine how high my cholesterol would be!)" u"This Luke's is at City Kitchen a place that congregates several different mini-versions of eateries famous in NYC (great concept).I ordered the Clam Chowder and the Lobster roll.Bamm! Both great delirious hearty meals for a cold afternoon.The roll was loaded with lobster and the clam chowder was thick and creamy.Only minuses: service was friendly but very slow and prices are high even for NYC standards. Seating is also limited so we ended up seating close to the hotel lobby (connected to city kitchen).If you are in the area it is a great option for lunch with a ton of different choices.Cheers!" u"I ordered the lobster roll with a side of clam chowder. \xa0Pretty pricey but the clam chowder was delicious and the lobster roll although on the small side had a very good flavor. \xa0There wasn't a lot going on so the flavor of the lobster really came out. \xa0Very buttery. \xa0Loved it. \xa0This restaurant is in a food court type place with 4 or so other spots so there isn't a whole lot of seating. \xa0We luckily found a place by the window and ate with a view of the busy street down below.Recommend if you'd like to treat yourself although the high price might make some turn away." u"I don't understand why this place is rated a 3 star when all the other Luke's lobsters are rated 4. Anyways this was my first time trying the LOBSTER ROLL. $16 alone $19 with pickle chips and soda. It was smaller than I expected BUT it had a good amount of lobster in it. And it was filled with superrrr buttery goodness!! I think it was on a white bread of some sort. I really enjoyed it! And it left me satisfied. HUGE chunks of lobster in every bite. Sounds good to me! The pickle and chips went well with the meal. I really liked how they had really different sodas than any other place. I had MEXICAN COLA which was tasty with a little bit of spice. It was in a glass bottle with a twist top! I didn't know that at first. Haha. Whoops! The person who took my order was very nice and had a good personality. He was he one who told me the soda was a twist off. Haha. Good atmosphere with a Dough nearby on the same floor for dessert. I would come back again!" u'Big chunks of lobster!!!!!!OMG! \xa0After i finished the lobster roll I was actually craving for their toast they used. \xa0Something about it it was very good not too crispy not too greasy not too saucy it was perfect. \xa0Also the little cumin on top of the lobster was just a perfect kick for it.We had a had time finding this place though before we go to see a Broadway show.It is on the second floor of the buliding you must enter the ground floor name CITY Kitchen.it is located on the 2ND FL with other little food stands.Would recommend this place worth the money.' u"I can taste every bit of the sweet in the sandwich. I love it so much I want it everyday. The pricing is the only downside to it. It's more to the pricey side but it also comes with a bottle a drink and chips. The place is crowded and full of good vibes! There are seatings nearby and even connected through a hotel. Thus if you do not have seating near the store they have a place with big television staircase benches in the hotel. It's absolutely beautiful and romantic sitting at the stairs. They're not regular stairs they even have cushions for people to lay down or sit comfortably :)" u'Lobster roll was really good. Served cold. Add some seafood seasoning over the lobster meat which is primarily claw meat. The bread though is what makes it taste better. Crispy outside and nice buttery inside. I would recommend. $20 for lobster roll soda and chips. It is INSIDE City Kitchen.' u"Service: 3/5Food: 5/5Located inside the Hotel - City Kitchens has a variety of eats to choose from.Luke's Lobster was manned by three staff yet it took them what seemed like a long time to make my lobster roll. One would just hold the lobster in his hand and talk for 30 seconds before placing it on the bread. It takes another employee to place butter. I feel they are overstaff and that one person could easily take orders and make the orders.The lobster sandwich however was great. If you're looking for best bang for the buck I recommend the shrimp sandwich. You get the same amount or even more content for half the price of the lobster sandwich $16 vs $8.I came here a second time to try the shrimp roll and the staff that day was more competent. Definitely worth $8 you get essentially the same amount of content as the lobster and both are delicious tasting. 10/10 would buy again." u'Amazing. Definitely getting one at least twice a week. Well worth the price. Roll is filled with lobster and the soup is as well.']
183.Speakeasy Dollhouse - Ziegfeld’s Midnight Frolic,[u"This show really was unique! The star Oliver had one of the best singing voices I've ever heard and she was stunning. Some people dressed up in costume which which was cool since you didn't know who was In the show or not. The dancing was great and if you get general admission some dancing is right in front of your face. My only complaint is that the show dragged on a bit long. It was very crowded and made me miss key points of the murder mystery. My friend and I left early cause we didn't understand the murder and I had to look it up on Wikipedia to understand the backstory to this. I still would highly recommend this show though!" u'(This review is for about 7 months ago so things may have changed...but honestly probably not.)I was here for a bachelorette party for our Sleep No More-loving bride. We all dressed up for the theme and paid extra for a table and it sounded like a great night of immersive theatre.Unfortunately this was neither theatre nor immersive.I mean I guess technically it was theatre. It was a show. But it was so poorly written it often felt like a community theatre production. Some of the singers were good and some were...not. The acrobatics however were awesome.As for being "immersive" well--the "characters" we were assigned ended up being meaningless. There was nothing to actually do with them; our assignments were fake and didn\'t lead to anything. When we tried to visit the backstage area where the interactions were supposed to take place in between acts we were closed out because there\'s a limited amount of room and nothing else to do. Finally the last time we were able to squeeze in and basically we watched a completely meaningless mini-show--still no interaction still no plot still no fun.The food was what you\'d expect--boring but not awful--and service sucked. It was so slow that we had to choose between eating a course and trying to participate in the "interactivity."By the end it was so boring that I couldn\'t wait for it to be over.' u"In A Nutshell:-I felt like I was in another world!-You feel like you are zapped back into time and partake in how people were entertained in that era.-I was a young ambitious Al Capone looking to partner up and start my own legendary crime reign!-The actors/actresses were awesome. \xa0Great personalities (minus the balloon girl) and some great Cirque du Soleil type athleticism.-Make sure you get there early bc the Liberty Diner is right smack in busy Times Square.Overall immersion theatre is really fun and you get to walk around and explore the venue where you'll be a critical part of the story no matter where you are :)" u'As I\'m writing this review I\'m torn because I really want me to looooove it. But think my expectation walking in was too high after all this raving review. We were 4 girls dressed the part and ready to "immerse" into the play. However it wasn\'t so "easy" todo so...however still a fun experience. Wear comfy shoes a lot of standing 2.5 hrs. 1. Venue: venue was pretty small old theater the play uses front of the theater small stage area for performances such as dance/acrobat etc and the back of the theater for more interactive play. You can enter the back part by going up there stairs next to the stage; it\'s "Paris" there and hence your paper "passport" given. however we had no idea where paris was since no signs or anything it was so crowded that maybe the front people got "instructions or explanation" that the back of the theater was paris but we were at the tail of he crowd and had no idea. There are different scenes and "areas" but not that extensive Paris n Paris hotel balconies and main theater. Glass encased room inside Paris hotel is where the "act" happens but too many people so couldn\'t see some of the acts. I\'m not sure if the venue was appropriate for this kind of play or maybe it wasn\'t coordinated right but it was hard to try to figure out what was happening bc we were not informed where something was happening. 2. is it a dinner theater or just theater?: so we were trying to find out if food was available? They said it\'s available through out the show however this is not what u think it\'s not like they have a bar and u order food thru out the show. It\'s table served tables are reserved front of the play and they own that table for the entirety of the play seems like. So if you want to have some seating get table n order food at least you would have a place to sit. Standing in heels for entire show which is like 2.5 hours is extremely hard. think if we had some seats we wouldn\'t have been so tired and enjoyed more. 3. Performance: the actors and dancers are good can see that they are professional and passionate. and it\'s kinda cool since they perform next to you sometimes talking to you asking question kissing your hand like you just met at a bar flirting sitting next to you and other actors play telling you stories etc. unlike huge Broadway production where you are restricted to seat and kinda far out watching  having the chandelier dancers in your FACe performing is super cool. All in all its a really fun and neat concept not to mention having excuse to dress up like flapper and experiencing little of roaring 20s. But think could have been executed so much better. This location and theme is pretty new so I\'m thinking maybe learning curve? but a general "map" of what everything is n where it will take place would be good. General summary of what will happen and what things to look for wold be good too without giving details. like what "guests" should look for in this act or general as the play. There were numerous songs and performance but we couldnt figure out how it relates to the play. And everyone coming should "dress" the part...like sleep no more everyone is given a mask. To have that Massive immersive ambiance. maybe they should give out feathered headbands n fake bead necklace to ladies and those plastic hat gentlemen and require a jacket to have that effect. patrons can return them after the show or something.' u'I had been wanting to attend this show for a very long time and finally got the opportunity a few weeks ago. This is an interactive performance. Audience members move between the main room of "New York" and the upstairs which is "Paris." There is a hotel set up in Paris as well to explore. I think it would be easier if I separate this list into pros and cons:Pros:- The Roaring 20\'s is a really hot theme lately. The 20\'s is one time period I would love to visit and this show did an INCREDIBLE job of re-creating the 20\'s- The scenery was outstanding. The space was utilized in the most incredible way and I truly felt transported in every area which I stood. New York - The actual show on stage was amazing and definitely felt authentic. costumes and dances were incredible. Easily entertaining and an incredible unique performance for sure. Paris Hotel - \xa0The glass room where you watch the exchange between Olive Thomas and her husband was great this is was interactive theater is all about. I felt like I was in the hotel room with them this was better than watching a movie and better than watching a show! Paris Outside of Hotel - Awe inspiring and jaw dropping. An INCREDIBLE set up with very high ceilings a dancer hanging off of a half moon set up French actors putting on "street performances" Again authentic. If you have always wanted to visit Paris in the 1920\'s you would have the opportunity here!Acrobats and Aerial artists- Incredible! Some of the best I\'ve ever seen! The silks performers were outstanding. The chandelier acrobats were my favorite simply gorgeous and this was definitely a unique feat! Cons: Unfortunately too many. - "Immersive" Theater? I think not. At least at shows like Queen of the Night you are given a specific task and the actors do things with you and to you. At QOTN it was very clear what you were supposed to be doing at all times. Here? Not one person had a clue. You are given a card with a role on it. For example I was supposed to find some blonde bimbo Marilyn Monore wannabe and ask her how to "break out" into the cinema experience. I was SO excited that I got a role only to find out that nothing actually happens. When I played my role to her she genuinely seemed bothered like she had no idea what I was talking about. She told me to sleep with lots of actors then pushed me towards the stage and told me she was busy. When my boyfriend played his role "Ask ____ if she is being abused and ask her to marry you" she simply was like "Aww no thanks." So stupid. There was no mission no point in even being there. You aimlessely walk back and forth between Paris and NY doing nothing except watching the stage performance or the glass box performance at the hotel in Paris. Nothing to figure out no special mission to go on truly aimless. Most people just sat around on the steps or in seats looking confused disappointed and straight up bored. They could have done so much more and got people so much more involved if it were truly immersive. You\'re given your role and no further instructions. I and most people spent the entire night confused and bored. The story line is happening all around you leaving everyone to have no idea what was going on. This play tried to do what Sleep No More Does (following one character around and having a possibility of many different experiences) and failed at it. - Your actors need an attitude adjustment. I understand the big shot actress with the blonde wig has TOTALLY hit the pinnacle of her career by being in this mediocre performance but chill with the attitude. My boyfriend who is usually very naive in these matters even called out the fact that she was not nice at all to say the least. I know her role was to be somewhat of a primadonna but on a few occasions when she saw us she would make a snide remark that was off script and out of character. "You\'re in my way you\'re in the way MOVE! GO OUT THERE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!" was uncalled for. A fair number of the actors seemed to have a condescending attitude when working with the audience. Something is mentally wrong with that actress her overcompensation was showing. Great storyline great potential incredible use of space and ability to transport the guests to an amazing world. Unfortunately too confusing and messy of a follow through. Enjoyed it but also felt very uncomfortable and confused many times.' u"What FUN! (Don't forget to have fun and dress up!) My friend surprised me with tickets to this which was awesome. I know there are sometimes a Groupon or Living Social deal so check that out before getting your tickets. I recommend definitely eating a hefty meal before hand in case you have to run around. Also if you want to dine here you have to make reservations ahead of time.They give you directions which are pretty clear and from there on you're on an ADVENTURE.Wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking around (if you want) and if you don't have have a reserved table you're on your feet. The show is amazing and the talent is great. The cast is fun.When you come in they give you a passport with a mission. When I went to do my mission I seemed to have surprised the actress like she didn't really know what I was talking about. Which threw me off also.The cast is awesome though. And if you go upstairs there are seating areas so rest your feet if needed.I want to become a chandelier girl so badly. What beautiful dancing and singing. Drinks are a bit pricey which is expected and not particularly strong.I just wished it were a little bigger and even more exploring to do! I just couldn't get enough!" u'If you are into dressing up in vintage attire and fancy escaping into another world and era; time periods you may sometimes wondering about: "How would it been like living in Berlin or Paris in the 1920\'s ? When these two Cities were the metropolis of the world.....Being entertained by Anita Berber: Weimar Berlin\'s Priestess of Debauchery or Marlene Dietrich singing to you at the Blue Angel. What a night out !!!Well just come and indulge in Ziegfeld\'s Midnight Frolic and I promise you these fantastic performers will dazzle and travel with you in this time machine.Just make sure you will explore the whole venue show and all the different stories which are going on several floors and rooms.For example in the interval go one floor up and behind the stage there you will find Paris where mayhem and mystery is waiting for you. I met Diana who carries roses spiked with wannabe cocaine in Weimar times it was real in our time its baby powder....... we can\'t even smoke on the street..... BUT "the divine signature cocktails" created at the Paris bar will compensate you; the names alone for each cocktail deserves an oscar: naming a drink syphilis that is naughty !!! All cocktails are made with fresh herbs flowers and seductive ingredients. You must try one !!!Be prepared to walk around get involved and be curious! Simply don\'t be shy.Because you are walking around the fun as well is meeting other people in the audience which you cannot do in an ordinary show where you are bound to your seat from start to finish."Ziegfeld is a big party of decadence."You will have so much fun and so you must as the tickets are ranging from $80 to $280; the $280 ticket is VIP which includes reception VIP balcony dinner drinks and this stimulating seductive show. It may sound pricy but it is not at all as it is an unforgettable experience and totally justifies the entrance fee.I soooooo recommend this show for special occasions like birthdays engagement parties double/single dates group of friends dressing up peeps vintage lovers and just anyone who appreciates quality time.Sorry guys no pictures for this review just go and see it for yourself...... I don\'t want to spoil your fun.' u'I came to see this with my husband and our two friends we all had a wonderful time at the Midnight Frolic. It really is a unique experience and the creativity of it all is quite mind blowing...the set costumes choreography and interpretations of various songs (performed by live singers) was truly entertaining. It\'s not your "typical broadway play" it\'s immersive it\'s a time warp back into the \'20s. You really SHOULD get off your butt and walk around (there are plenty of unreserved seats available if you get tired of walking around... I would assume that you would pay for a reserved table or seat just to guarantee you have a seat to return to not to plant yourself there ALL NIGHT and complain about the view being blocked by people who are fully taking advantage of the experience) and it\'s not necessary but it really makes it even more fun if you poke around a bit be nosy talk to the cast play the role they give you when you enter. I salute all the cast and crew for their obvious passion and dedication for making this a beautiful experience. It\'s clear that a lot of work and TLC went into this production. A magical event--I totally recommend it!' u'Ah...so nice that I went twice.If you wish to make great night of being in Times Square  then make it a night in Paris in the 1920\'s and attend the Midnight FrolicThe very best way to enjoy this show is to come dress up like the time period it portrays ( perhaps you may come and act like a character from that time period ) and interact like you\'re actually there Frolic / sin / sex / drink while you\'re trying to figure out "Who Done It "All the characters are magnificent ...and don\'t get me stated on the chandelier' u"If you ever wanted a taste of what it was like to experience an entertaining night out back in the roaring 20s definitely check out this immersive theater show. \xa0It was a feast for my eyes and ears as I was transported back into time listening to some of the great standards and walking among performers who were dressed to 20s perfection. The cast is extremely talented fun and make you feel like you are part of the story. \xa0My camera and I had a lot to take in that night. \xa0The set and costumes are gorgeous. This is the kind of show where you really benefit from exploring and engaging with everyone. The fact that the story is based on the life of a real Ziegfeld Follies girl was also appealing to me because I am a history buff. \xa0Definitely dress up if you want - have fun! \xa0Wear comfy shoes as you may be standing for most of the time (just like a night out at a club) but it is SO worth it. In between acts there are so many areas to explore grab a drink sit down talk to people and feel like you are out on the town back in the day. I went alone and had a blast. They do sell VIP tickets that include dinner and seating but I was very happy with walking around and changing my vantage point.Overall it's a fun sexy decadent night out." u"What a disappointment. I've seen other interactive theater productions including Sleep No More and Then She Fell which I absolutely loved. This show was a complete amateur-hour. Even for $47 on Groupon it's absolutely not worth it. Theatre was packed over-capacity where it was very difficult to catch the main acts. The sets are minimalist and there are very few areas to wander and discover. The entire production takes place in 3 rooms. Dancing and singing was mediocre...on par with what you might expect from cruise ship or Atlantic City theater. You're given a role and a passport which sounds like an interesting concept but turns out to be completely useless to the plot... I get the sense that the actors aren't trained well on how to incorporate the roles into the act and seem confused when you approach them.Too many other awesome shows that pull off the interactive theater style more effectively. I'm truly surprised at the positive yelp reviews.... My guess is that those reviewers aren't aware of the other better quality shows out there." u'One of the worst experiences we have had in the city. I have been a NYC resident for 10 years and we have been to many "speakeasy clubs"... This was a let-down. After buying the tickets beforehand we were told that it would be standing room only. Fine. We come up to the check-in/box office... They have some tables available. Great... If you want to pay for bottle service... Starting at $70 per bottle per couple. Oh and we\'re sold out of $70 bottles. Basically just a money pit for tourists who don\'t know any better. The show was fine. The MC was laughable and was doing a lot of "shmacting" but I guess that\'s the "style" they\'re going for. The aerial work was amazing but other than that it was mediocre dancing and talented singers doing 1920\'s covers of modern songs. We tried to complain to the management that it was not what was advertised and the quality was not what we felt we\'d paid for. He was completely unhelpful. He said that he had nothing to do with the show and all he managed was the food/drink. This venue is completely mis-managed. I hope that it is fixed soon because the space is beautiful and what is currently in there is a waste of your time and money. Do not waste your time or more importantly your money.' u'this show is a STEAL on groupon for ~$40 *without dinner*. it\'s a theater wrapped up in a speakeasy. you time travel back to the 20\'s into a "who done it" interactive musical /play. be sure to dress UP and do bring comfy shoes to walk around in. be sure to be open to interacting with the scenes/ actors. the set design is amazing and the actors are so talented. don\'t pay attention to other reviews that say the execution is poor - you actually have to pay attention and figure out the story / mystery. that means listening to the lyrics/songs which tell you WHERE TO GO. you have to remember clues to piece things together (admittedly difficult when inebriated. XD)GO SEE IT.' u"One of the best nights I've EVER had in NYC was spent at this truly exceptional show!It absolutely felt like my friend and I had time traveled into the past back into the early 1900s and were about to see a Ziegfeld Follies show. \xa0The performers were all extremely talented and captivating and actually interacted with us! \xa0A man playing Florence Ziegfeld himself approached us with his business card and asked us to audition to be one of his showgirls. \xa0Robyn Adele Anderson (of Postmodern Jukebox fame) blew me away with her vocals and Delysia LaChatte killed it as Josephine Baker!Not only were the singing dancing and costumes stunning and authentic the scenery was so believable and there was so much to explore and experience between acts as well. \xa0The visual eye candy (a crystal chandelier with gorgeous ladies in the air!) also reminded me of something out of one of my favorite movies Moulin Rouge. \xa0I loved that it was in a hidden theatre with a password needed to enter and that a murder mystery was unfolding right in front of our very eyes-- on stage and off!My friend and I dressed up for the evening in attire from the era and had the absolute best night - highly recommend! \xa0(We were sad to leave the fantasy and return to reality and would really like to see it all again!)" u"One of the best interactive immersive theater shows I have ever been to.My boyfriend and I went all out and dressed to play the part of 20's prohibition got boozy with the ziegfeld ladies explored the historical hidden theater (which is important to do - there's so much to see and experience!) and made friends along the way. Truly a unique experience which left us walking away smiling. Truly impressed how you just meld into being an actor in the show.Go check it out!" u"What an experience! Imagine Sleep No More but better! The burlesque was fantastic and the actors very endearing it felt like I knew the characters personally. I didn't know anything about Olive Thomas... her story is so tragic and interesting and the cheeky and voluptuous blond who plays her is truly mesmerizing. It brought the whole story to life. I might add that the entire cast is devilishly handsome...I have never seen anything like this show it just transports you to a different time a different world altogether. I don't want to give away too many details because the whole beauty of this show is the discovery part and the interaction between you and all the delights going on around you. Go see this!" u"A truly magical evening. So many details you won't want to blink in case you miss it! Immersive theatre at its most elegant." u"Severely awkward experience. The idea sounds awesome on paper but fails tremendously in reality. People are just standing around watching a bunch of different things going on - which feels like you're in the mind of a person with ADHD. \xa0Also - drinks are SEVERELY expensive. Prepare to spend $42 on two liquor drinks. Plan accordingly." u"We aren't new to immersive theatre and we loved this show. Venue is absolutely great. The theatre is huge and we loved the high ceilings and mysterious yet modern vibe of hall where Paris was. The songs cabaret and chandelier dancing girls are all great. Beauty is there is a show going on all the time and one can venture back and forth from here to Paris and each time one will have slightly different experience.This is the 2nd production of speakeasy dollhouse we saw and we truly enjoyed it." u'I had the pleasure of seeing a wonderful show .Ziegfeld midnight frolic ... Performed in the heart of Times Square this \xa0wonderful show brings the audience back to the 1920s..... With a talented \xa0cast \xa0that sings and dances to old favorites....you want to see this show again and again...money well spent!']
121.Sake Bar Hagi 46,[u"Sake Bar Hagi has a solid 5 stars for hospitality. We got denied food at Green Dim Sum at 2:40PM because they close at 3PM. Quite frankly that's my biggest pet peeve a place that closes early when their sign specifically states they close at 3PM. But Hagi we slid into the restaurant at 2:50PM when their kitchen also closed at 3PM. But unlike Green Dim Sum Hagi took our order and did what a restaurant is supposed to do- feed us. Therefore Hagi you get 5 stars for not letting us down. They asked for our check during the middle of the meal (which I don't blame them it seemed that they were changing shifts). I was really glad that they said we could order!The food was really good too! I ordered the Sukiyaki Udon ($12) that came in this metal pot with beef tofu and veggies. The broth is a little sweet but savory. The food portion was perfect for me. The carrots were cut into little flowers. How cute! Also got a chicken stick ($2) grilled really well. Everything was delicious the waitress was attentive and they even split the check for us by order (party of 3)- that was probably because we were the only people in the place though." u'Good drinking spot right close by time square.Karage was very good and sukiyaki was of a good quality.Good sake bar here we even tried a sake champagne(with bubbles)- not to everyone tastes - as it was a tad too sweet.Good happy hour and have some crazy drinking food on the menu - we tried the seafood tempura pizza ( which was super greasy)! Hahaha' u"This hagi location is cleaner quieter classier and less dungeon like. It's a great place to make a reservation for large groups - the service was great (gratuity was included in our party of 10).The menu items seem different than the other hagi location though or maybe it's been a while since I've been to hagi.The mentai pasta was delicious!! The chicken meatballs were really soft and flavorful. \xa0I loved the mixed poke (tuna and salmon) with egg yolk in a martini glass. The fried oyster was good as was the fried chicken. \xa0Their sashimi was fresh and on top of deliciously flavored white sushi rice that I forced them to take away from me.We ended the meal with green tea ice cream and lady M's crepe cake. Now I definitely don't remember this on the original hagi menu.I'd definitely come back again with a large group!" u'My friend and I came here to get mochi and a beer yesterday...it was a great experience! Think of this place as like an Asian dive bar. They had some TVs a full bar cool drink options (like macha beer) and a TON of different sakes. We both got a Sapporo which was only $3. 3 pieces of green tea mochi = $4.The service was good - the bartender was attentive to us and answered our questions. I would definitely go back and try dinner/other foods and drinks.' u'Stumbled upon this place after wandering along 9th Ave for a couple miles. A friend met up with me for a late dinner so it was a nice casual setting for that. Ordered a couple things to split including fried chicken gizzard spaghetti w/ roe yakitori and okonomiyaki. Everything was just okay nothing outstanding but nothing too bad either. The okonomiyaki was adorable in its little pan though! The drink I had a lychee something was delicious too. Straightforward service and pretty much a no frills type of place.' u'This spot offers the Izakaya menu during lunch time which is awesome to me! Even though they are located in Hell\'s Kitchen with their delightful menu they are the "Heaven\'s Kitchen." \xa0The inside was nice and large much larger than it looks from outside.We wanted to try several kinds of dishes here so we ordered a few things to share including Pizza Tempura. I know. They did good job at all the dishes other than one - Ebiten Kushi. They forgot the spicy mayonnaise so we had to flag down our waitress to get it. The waitress was a Japanese lady who was very kind and polite but it felt like she needed more help to take care of all the tables (which wasn\'t that many) with proper attention. However I have to mention there was one table two older American ladies who had many questions about the menu. The most offerings are authentic and also very unique. I would definitely go back there fore more of their fun and tasty creations! Read my full review of this restaurant and food on my food blog foodlovergirl.' u"Great place to catch up with some friends and share a whole bunch of dishes that won't break the bank! My two friends and I ordered an assortment of dishes that were large in portion and easy for sharing. The service was attentive restaurant d\xe9cor is nice and casual and they had two TVs for sports watching at the back of the restaurant. We started with the Hana Sake White Peach flavor which was delicious. At $25 a bottle it was well worth the purchase. I believe we went through 2 cups each at least.As for the food we got the chicken meatball curry and amakara yukke from the winter special menu. The chicken meatballs were all right. A bit too sweet for my liking and the texture wasn't great so I would opt out from it going forward. The amakara yukke was fresh salmon and tuna sashimi marinated in a sweet spicy sauce topped with a raw quail egg. The dish was sweet and had plenty of fish to share. A good portioned amount and reasonable for the price. We also got the Takoyaki (pan friend octopus balls) which is one of my favorite Japanese dishes. That was well made and came in an order of 6. As for the main dishes we shared the Mentai Pasta which is what this place is well-known for. Amazing. The pasta was al dente and full of flavor from the spicy cod fish roe. It wasn't a fishy dish and the sauce was super creamy. We also shared the kimchee fried rice which came with large pork pieces. A solid fried rice dish as well. It didn't taste too oily and there was plenty of kimchee and pork to go around.Overall a great place for chill dining with friends or a date. Food and drinks are both very reasonably price and plentiful." u"For value the place is a steal in Restaurant Row/Theatre District. It's a hole in the wall for Japanese izakaya food. Food is great and cheap but the service could be improved. The mentaiko fried rice is a hit it's a fried rice with cod roe. I also would recommend the skewers too. Not too thrilled about the service seeing how one of my friends was chased for additional tip or how one of the waitstaff came off rather unfriendly." u'An excellent choice for Izakaya style restaurant. Went here on a Monday night at 9pm place stays open until 2pm according to the server. Food was good and so was the drinks with reasonable prices. The place is authentic including loud (in a good way) Japanese Salary men grabbing a drink and a bite with colleagues after a long days work. Reminds me of Tokyo.' u'The old location definitely has more class and old school "izakaya" feel to it and the kitchen has "depth". New location will take some time getting used to but I like the modern feel and new staff that works here. Obviously there is not the typical 1 hour wait and even the food comes out really quick. \xa0You can miss it if you are not looking for it so make sure to pay attention as you are walking.There\'s a small 10 people seating bar to the right and the restaurant expands into the back space. It\'s still small and not that big. \xa0Bar offers sake tasting menu and you can get large or small sake tasting or shochu tasting as well. When they asked large or small I just said YES. Food quality will take little more time to develop. It\'s like the cooking equipment needs more grease and dirt. It still hit the spot on a Friday night sake drinking requirements.The bartenders are extremely friendly and helpful. My buddy and I really enjoyed our time there learning more about Japanese culture.' u"I've been to the other location and I'm glad this one opened up because it's more convenient for me. It has always just been average to me but my friends seems to really like coming here. There's always balanced pros and cons about this place so I'm never really disappointed or really satisfied. I feel like I enjoy this place because of the friends I go eat with rather than the place itself. This place has a huge selection of small eats entrees and drinks! I love variety but I seem to always get the same items. The prices are fair but it will really add up when you see your bill. They serve my favorite yuzu sake so they have my heart for that. I love their chicken skin and other organ items. I can't find myself to enjoy their entree options but maybe that will change the next time I feel hungry. Overall the food quality is mediocre. Some dishes should have a smaller portion size and some should include more. The atmosphere is casual and chill. You'll have a great time having small eats and drinking with your friends here. The staff is very attentive and friendly." u'Ordered the salmon don and they ran out of roe yet did not give me a discount on the bill. \xa0Not nice. \xa0The roe is the best part! \xa0They need to step up their game.' u"I visited this place recently on a weekday evening for dinner and enjoyed my time here. I was not too hungry so I only ordered a couple of dishes. They just opened so they don't have all of the alcoholic beverages advertised on the menu just yet. I like the tapa-style options here as it is a the perfect spot for a light dinner. If you are super hungry you may consider going elsewhere as the prices add up quickly. They do have a 2-hour dining limit so make sure you don't overstay here. I enjoyed my food so it is more like 3.5 stars but upgrading to 4 stars because they have plenty of outlets available at the bar seating area if you need to charge your phone.Two single-stall for men's and women's bathroom. Bathroom is super clean always a plus. They only have a hand dryer not paper towels." u'Love this place! Everything is delicious and love the beer cocktail especially with the tropical mix! And the portion is good for the price range! Definitely is a good happy hour and dinner gathering spot with friends! Love the Japanese atmosphere inside.' u"It seems like more and popular Japanese establishments are opening new outposts around Manhattan and Sake Bar Hagi is no exception.This new branch on 46 street in the middle of restaurant row is a great new addition to the neighborhood. \xa0Actually it's a great idea to open an izakaya (better known as a Japanese bar that serves small dishes and other simple fare) in the theater district as there are few places nearby that are direct competitors in this particular genre.Sake Bar Hagi 46 has a very inviting atmosphere. \xa0The service is great and the entire place offers a warm and pleasant environment. \xa0As expected the drink menu is extensive and you'll have no problem finding plenty of Japanese beer sake and even Korean soju options. \xa0The menu is also pretty solid with plenty of traditional Japanese fare to choose from.I ordered a lot of food during my first visit but the real standouts were the fried chicken agedashi tofu fried oysters takoyaki (fried octopus) and okonomyaki (seafood pancake). \xa0The ramen here was just average and I would definitely recommend skipping the lackluster kimchee fried rice. \xa0But for the most part the food was great the beer was ice cold and the prices were extremely reasonable.The decor is simple and even though the seating can be a bit tight it's still a really great place to hang out with friends when you're in the mood for some simple Japanese chow." u'I had my food delivered to my hotel at 2:30am just right before they closed. Surprisingly they still delivered that late. \xa0Food was good. \xa0Yakitori was tasty.. I will order from them again next time I need a late night meal.' u'Awesome Japanese Izakaya-style restaurant with interesting and creative takes on a lot of great Japanese pub food. The best part is that they are open for lunch and dinner while many Izakayas in NYC are only open for dinner and late night. Located in Theater District vicinity this is a great spot before or after your visit to "The Great White Way" of Broadway. Hagi 46\'s \xa0menu runs the gamut with Yakitori Fried/Saut\xe9ed  Noodles Rice Sake/Beer and desserts. On our first visit we only had a few samplings because it is easy to fill up. This place is also great for groups where you can share food together. The decor and interior design is very minimalist. I really enjoyed the vintage Japanese beer photos which were used to promote beer in Japan. I could not help but take some photos of the posters.Here is a few items that I had the pleasure of eating.The Omusoba is a creative take on the standard Omurice which is a omelette with Rice. This Omusoba is combining an omelette and yaki-soba which is a noodles with pan fried egg and chicken.Next was a pizza tempura. I have had a lot of tempura of different vegetables and meat but never pizza. The tempura was light and just right not overcooked so I was VERY pleased with this selection.Another small appetizer was the Ebitem Kushi which \xa0is Shrimp Tempura skewered with spicy mayo. The kitchen did make a mistake by not putting the mayo on. We asked our waitress who fixed it as soon as we could wave her down.I really enjoyed the Natto Jaco Pasta. Now on the whole Japanese people will say that non-Japanese do not like Natto a bean curd but it is surprisingly tasty if you get over the initial odor. The Natto Jaco Pasta was super yummy. Another reason to love Natto is that is very healthy for you. I would like to have many more items but I do not want to have to rolled out of the restaurant. \xa0Don\'t forget to snag a stamp card for the repeat visitors.One finally funny note under the restaurant\'s store which you see in my photos they have "Heaven\'s Kitchen" vs. the neighborhood\'s name Hell\'s Kitchen.' u"Review is for seamless... The restaurant serves dishes perfect for delivery! Carb heavy so even it gets cold it still tastes good after microwaving and generous portions. Only problem is that it takes a while for the food to come (~60 min) and I live only a couple blocks away. But the food is still consistently better than other Japanese delivery restaurants in the area. I've tried the chicken teriyaki kimchi fried rice (my favorite) and Mentai Pasta - all were great. What stole the show was the $9 salmon sashimi I ordered though. It was possibly the best juiciest thickest salmon sashimi slices I have eaten and for takeout no less! Although it only came with 4-5 slices (leaving it at $2 a pop) it has me craving for more." u'"I do not know about this one"I came here really not knowing about the reputation that the Times Square location has and I am glad that I did not because I would have been extremely disappointed. I will start with the good. The staff and service were pretty on point. The hostess and bartenders were really nice and engaging. The struggle. -For 9pm on a Monday night the place was completely empty. No ... Wait there were two other people there. -The food was really bland and flavorless. That was kind of weird because the waitress said that the pasta dish and the roe fried rice were the most popular items on the menu. Based on her suggestion that is why we ordered those. The rice dish was supposed to have been spicy but it was not. I asked another waiter for some sort of hot sauce to liven the dish up and he gave me seasoned salt. This did nit help at all.-Why was the Merlot cold?I am pretty sure that I will not be dining here again. Although I may have a Hendricks martini again.' u"Surprisingly good Sake Bar Hagi 46 is located on a block not known for good places. Gyozas weren't very good and the seaweed salad was overly sauced but the pork ramen was excellent. \xa0Staff was efficient and friendly. Prices were reasonable. Great place to kick back with some friends over plenty of sake."]
203.Uptown Swirl,[u'Uptown Swirl appears to be uninspired wordplay on the awful Billy Joel\'s awful "Uptown Girl" song. Despite the inauspicious name plus the Times Square tourist trap location the place is actually not bad with decent pricing. At other frozen yogurt places when I\'ve gone wild with the condiments I\'ve gotten a shock at the register. Not so here. But maybe because my friend Paul K. paid for it and I didn\'t care as much.Stuff tasted standard but good. Nothing gross. Nice thing to have while walking on a humid summer day.' u"Let's keep it short and sweet. Ordered a pre-theater snack the strawberry and banana crepe. Opted out the chocolate and asked for extra powdered sugar and whip cream. Crepe was light and fluffy. Fruit was ripe and sweet. Powdered sugar and whip was the perfect accompaniment!  A little on the pricey side for $9 but it was the perfect sweet treat before our show!" u'CJ at Uptown Swirl:I came to the USA from London/England 3 years ago and being a Crepe Fanatic I have been exploring the best French Crepe places to eat in the USA ever since. The freshness of the crepe the texture and flavor of the crepe mixture and the composition and balance of the way the chocolate is dispersed evenly in a crepe is very important to me and it makes a huge difference on the end result of the crepe and it\'s enjoyment. \xa0I discovered Uptown Swirl when researching best Crepe places to visit in New York and I am ecstatic that I did. I read all Yelp reviews but I ultimately go by how the crepes look in the pictures. Being a food critic cook and baker I can tell a lot from the composition of the crepe in the pictures. Uptown Swirl crepes looked like just what I was looking for. When I entered the cafe I came across an amazing crepe making chef called "CJ" and I asked her to create for me a custom made crepe to my liking. She accommodated my request immediately and created the most beautiful delicious and mind-blowing Nutella and Milk Belgium Chocolate Crepe I have ever tasted! Their crepe is mind-blowinggg. Simply Deeeeeelicious ... simply divine.CJ created the crepe with such finesse and myself my husband and son enjoyed the crepe so much that we visited every day on our trip to New York. \xa0Uptown Swirl has got to be one of the best crepes I have ever tasted. Freshly made. Amazingly tasty. I\'m going to be here everytime I visit New York. Whenever we want to go out with family and friends this is the place I am taking them or meeting up with them now and I highly recommend it to all crepe lovers like me. I have been dreaming about this crepe place all week. Can\'t wait to visit New York again. Make sure you order the Sweet Nutella and Belgium chocolate crepe. You will love it :) Wish they were in Chicago too because then I would be in there everyday :D The Belgium chocolate is Silky Rich Decadent and Velvety Smooth. Every crepe made by CJ is perfectly created with beautifully prepared ingredients. Divine and totally delicious tantalizing all of my taste buds every time \xa0Uptown Swirl Crepes are Delicious Fresh Yummy Tantalizing Full of Flavour and Taste... A Beautiful Creation not to be missed by CJ!' u"Atmosphere: loooots of seating for a place in the heart of Times Square. I was very impressed. And comfortable couches upstairs if you come with a large party head upstairs! Cute decor and nice lighting too. Prices: eh a little pricey for froyo but I think they're just hiked because of the stores location. My froyo I would've typically paid no more than $6 anywhere else but here it was $7 even with the 10% off. Froyo: loooots of flavors. I got the marshmallow and birthday cake- both delicious. The toppings could use some work. The fruits looked a little old but everything else was plentiful. Will I be back? It's cute and all but only if I can't find another place closer. I wouldn't be opposed to it because of the 10% off and they also give you this awesome option of blending your toppings and froyo into a smoothie.I'd say go but only if you're in the area. Don't make a special trip. :)" u"Uptown Swirl is an intriguing place in Midtown for dessert. \xa0They serve frozen yogurt as well as crepes. \xa0I was enticed to come because I saw the one $ sign next to its name as I was frantically rummaging through Yelp for a cheap dessert place to eat at with friends. \xa0Another thing that attracted me to this place is the fact that if you check in you get 10% off your purchase.Admittedly the table area was pretty unclean. \xa0It does have enough space as it has two floors; however the decor looked plain. \xa0Some cops came up to the second floor to hang around for no reason and then just left. \xa0That has nothing to do with my review but I thought I might as well just add that tidbit in.Onto the crepes: \xa0Sorry I thought it was way too sweet. \xa0Although the portion was humongous that doesn't matter if the taste isn't proportionally humongous.Would I come back again? \xa0Perhaps. \xa0Most likely not." u"I came here with a few friends after shopping and walking around to grab a quick dessert. We found this place on Yelp in the Times Square vicinity and saw that they offered a 10% discount off of your order if you checked in. So that's a big plus. Overall this place is pretty decently sized for a dessert place in Times Square. The main level was pretty narrow with the walls aligned with frozen yogurt stations and seating towards the back. If you make your way up the narrow staircase there's a seating area that's decently sized. The staff could've done a better job cleaning up the place though. Previous customer's dessert crumbs and sticky messes were left all along the tables and chairs. -1 star for cleanliness. I ordered froyo with 2-3 toppings and my total came out to about $7 with the Yelp check-in. Not bad. A lot cheaper than 16 Handles. Just a heads up don't get the candy corn with your froyo like I did because it does have a tendency to harden after time. Other than that everything was good. My friends each ordered crepes and they were humongous and delicious. They were made fresh and piping hot. Overall I enjoyed my experience here and I'll be back in the future." u"5 stars for location fast and efficient service a yogurt and crepe shop value and location! And they're open late!Located a couple of blocks off Times Square this little place for sure beats other choices for desserts. This is a yogurt AND crepe shop. What can get better?!? A yogurt crepe AND bacon shop? Yes! Nvm. I ordered the Nutella and banana crepe for $9 totally worth it because it was very hearty and super Delish. I also asked to get Nutella drizzled on top. They make all kinds of crepes: breakfast dessert and lunch/dinner more hearty and savory choice to fill your tummy! They're made to order and made in front of you so feel free to boss them around . \xa0Just kidding. I \xa0all kinds of Creeps!!!! Yussss!!!!" u"The floor and tables could have been wiped down but otherwise no complaints about the froyo. \xa0They had an employee dispensing samples of the flavors for you which deters you from just going apeshit and making a mess. \xa0I like it better this way it's more sanitary (looking at all you people who lick your sample cup and then hold it up to the dispenser opening for another taste ugh).If you're like me and love cookie dough and insist that it adorn all your froyo creations you will really like this tidbit: they had THREE types of cookie dough. \xa0I did not even know that was possible. \xa0My mind = officially blown. \xa0The fruit was also decently fresh and well washed.You can eat in their little loft area upstairs but why do that when Times Square is just a few steps away? \xa0Grab your stuff and go wander and people watch! :)" u"We came here based on reviews and because Ellen's Starlight Diner's line was a block long! No singers here boo-hoo but the crepes looked good. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 I split crepe #16; strawberries bananas & nutella no powdered sugar on top please! \xa0Very tasty very fresh. They make it right in front of you. \xa0It was $16 which included a 20 oz Diet Pepsi and a bottle of Pure Leaf Tea. \xa0They also sell \xa0self serve yogurt." u'I was SO very excited to finally try this place out... Only to find that... They aren\'t open when they said they are open. I waited until 10:06 today (had to get to work) and according to someone else who was also waiting (apparently froyo/crepe in the morning is a thing?) they are never open on time. Maybe my expectations are too high in expecting the open times to be more exacting? Who knows. Either way now I know "my" Duane Reade\'s frozen yogurt isn\'t half bad at all. #silverlining' u"This place was a fly-infested dirty frozen yogurt place with many no-no's. The toppings labels were mismatched 3/4 were left empty and STALE. I'm talking waffle cone chips were curling up. The doors were left open letting all the humidity into the store. My friend and I decided to venture up the dirty and scuffed staircase to eat in the designated area where we found ourselves shoo-ing flies out of our face as we attempted to eat our very quickly melting yogurt. The overflowing garbage can that exploded with flies as we quickly left seemed to be a fitting ending to this experience." u'Had a craving for ice cream while in Times Square and went to Yelp for suggestions. This was near the top of the list so we decided to give it a try and we were so glad we did. I had "The Belgian" -- a crepe with strawberries bananas nutella and biscoff sauce (cookie butter) and it was to-die-for. They have quite a few flavors of froyo my daughter really enjoyed hers especially the numerous toppings. The prices were on the steep side but it is Times Square so not unexpected. My only disappointment was the seating area upstairs -- it\'s a little on the grubby side but a great birds-eye-view of the establishement.' u"Your average self-service froyo place. It's not the place's fault I felt disgusting and full of self-loathing afterwards." u'Crepes were amazing and the service was great. \xa0I had the butter and sugar crepe and was in heaven.' u"For a place in Times Square this shop served pretty good crepes. The cost of our crepe was somewhat high but I figured it was due to the location. What surprised us was actually how LARGE the crepe was. For the price we paid the crepe was a good size. It was a little too much between just two people so maybe add another person in the group. We ordered the Nutella chocolate mousse with strawberry and that was so good. The crepe was soft and they did not skip on the amount of Nutella. Come drop by if you're in the mood for some sweets!" u"We came in and we asked for a sample cup. An elderly men sitting on the side right away stood up and he asked me which one I want to try. I guess I'm not used of someone doing that for me. Since I live in Southern California and a place called Yogurt Land give us few little cups and we try whatever we want. This place is very pricey." u'Walking downtown and took a sample and had to go inside. \xa0It was the prefect late night sweet snack since it was pretty chilly that night. \xa0I had a speculoos or number 24. So soft and warm and tasty. Definitely getting something else before my flight tomorrow.' u'Decent fro-yo. Nothing great nothing terrible. Wish they had more fruit options.' u"I love crepes and frozen yogurt so when I had the craving and found this place I was excited. Their frozen yogurt was pretty good with a wide array of toppings. I was also hungry so I decided to try out a savory crepe. I choose a mushroom spinach and swiss crepe. Having been to other crepe places in the DMV/NYC area I'd like to say that I know what a good crepe looks/tastes like. The spinach was definitely a few days old precooked and soggy when they got it out of the container to put on the crepe; the swiss cheese was dry when it came out of the container (which is perfectly fine because it's melted anyway). However a few bites determined the ingredients were a bit older than my stomach could handle (~1 day recovery time). I'm guessing that their savory crepes don't get bought as much as their sweet crepes/frozen yogurt. I recommend they pare down their menu so they can always have fresh ingredients on hand for all of their menu items." u"VERY tasty crepes! They pour the batter and make it in front of you. I recommend getting the Biscoff cookie butter and whipped cream on top. So smooth and creamy but still light enough to make you not feel gross afterwards. Service was very friendly and professional. There's a good amount of seating upstairs and as a tip for the winter I noticed that they keep it very warm inside."]
164.The Sky Deck,[u'Great steaks and a great view. Mashed potatoes are delicious. FYI. Make an reservation to sit with a view. They were turning people away without a reservation and made them sit in the bar area even though there were tables.' u"Now Super Nova the atmosphere was great and food good. Just disappointed in the mercilessly slow service. Waited 30 minutes for a table in the empty restaurant another 30 to order and never could get our waitress's attention for another round of drinks. Bar service was much better - skip the restaurant and hang out in the lounge. Bar menu looked great." u'This place is wow and a well kept gem that means it is quiet and relaxed while so close to the chaos of times square. Love the entrance the decor the cocktails and the food! Ace place to visit before a broadway show. Hotel looks awesome too wishing we had checked in here!' u'Quiet and relaxed on a Monday night. Fine views and service only slightly pricey for the neighborhood. If you want a place you can actually sit with someone and talk this might be it.' u'Went here for drinks and apps before our show and found this place in doing a search on Yelp. \xa0We were looking for a place without a big crowd so we could talk about our day and not be rushed before the show and this fit the bill perfectly. \xa0Great view from the deck. \xa0Service was great. \xa0Food was great. \xa0Lots of energy and a great vibe.' u"It s the Novotel Lobby bar. This place is never ever crowded and you get easy access to a terrasse with a view of North Times Square. There's plenty of places to sit and drink outside. I like it because it's easy to get in and out of this bar." u"This hotel lobby/bar within Novotel hotel has a cool airport theme and an almost intergalactic cave-like entrance. \xa0There isn't much of a view or bar so it's more of a passthrough spot and nice waiting area for hotel guests rather than a destination." u"We needed a place to eat before seeing a show. Lines were long at our usual restaurants so we looked on Yelp and found this. I called to see it there was a wait and there wasn't so we walked over. What a beautiful super chic hotel (Novotel Hotel)! There were plenty of available tables. Is this place a big secret? \xa0Outside and inside seating beautiful decor funky (but not too funky) music amazing view overlooking Times Square and a congenial attentive staff. I'll never get used to paying New York City prices so everything seemed a little high to me but relatively speaking really not bad when you factor in the ambiance and overall experience. We just had cheese burgers but they were delicious and of a nice size. We found our new hidden gem place to eat before shows!" u'The Novotel has a restaurant/bar in the lobby on the 7th floor called Supernova. \xa0I has a nice view good food reasonably priced and decent service from a friendly staff. \xa0The SKY DECK is only open for special events according to the hostest.' u"We hit up many bars during our trip to the city and this was by far my favorite. \xa0The views from the patio can't be beat and the specialty drinks were outstanding. \xa0But the best part was the service. \xa0Our bartender Victor was awesome! \xa0He had great recommendations let us sample things gave us some keepsakes and was one of the friendliest people we encountered during our NYC travels. \xa0Go in there and find Victor he'll treat you right." u'The hotel restaurant is called Super Nova. \xa0Silly name and a very limited menu but every item I had for lunch was EXCELLENT and the breakfast buffet had good-tasting hot entrees. \xa0This place is a hidden gem and while I believe they deserve recognition I am worried that when word gets out this place could become overly-crowded. \xa0The place has floor to ceiling windows with killer views of Times Square. \xa0Prices are reasonable (considering its in a hotel in a tourist destination). \xa0I heard French Spanish Portugese and Italian spoken at neighboring tables giving the place an international feel. \xa0It is on the 5th floor of the Novotel Hotel.' u'Okay... so they call this the Sky Deck? The outdoor terrace at the Novotel Hotel is just lovely. Even if you live here. I know nothing about the food. I don\'t even know how it looks as I\'ve never seen anyone eat anything here. I have no idea how the drinks are I\'ve only had cheap white wine ("cheap" is relative.) What I do know is that on a nice day in midtown Manhattan you could do worse. It\'s a great view of Times Square. You feel like you\'re there with a cocktail without actually being there jostled around by sweaty tourists with no understanding of personal space. And the staff is delightful. If you live here give it a try & see if you don\'t find that it\'s a great place to take out of town guests to give them a "Times Square Experience" without actually having to go there.' u"Words can not describe how fabulous this place is. From the amazing view superb service mouth watering food and more than reasonable prices; the Sky Deck located in the Novotel Hotel on the 7th floor will become your favorite spot. The out door area is something you have to experience to believe. Having been to the View located in the Marrior just a couple of blocks away I can say without heistation this is way better because they offer outdoor seating and service. We \xa0had drinks outside and were in total awe not just of the view but the beauty of the set up as well as the furniture. The food is not only delicious and as l already said reasonable by most people's standards (especially considering the area) \xa0the portions are more than generous. I was shocked to see burgers on the menu in such an upscale place but they are there. My mother and I went after seeing a play and I am already planning on going back (before the outside closes for the fall and winter season) with friends. And if you're looking just to have drinks look no further because the Sky Deck is a perfect place to go out for drinks too. You really can't go wrong by choosing this place. Enjoy!!"]
202.Haru,[u"Came here for lunch and had quite a pleasant experience. Ordered the popcorn shrimp and edamame as starters. The shrimp was fresh the batter was light and not too oily and I liked the spicy mayo sauce it was drizzled with. Same goes for the edamame very fresh and not too salty. For my main course I ordered the salmon jalapeno shrimp tempura and the spicy salmon. The fish was very fresh and the sushi was well rolled and prepared (none of that falling apart business!) I left feeling very full and satisfied this was a great place to grab some good sushi and I'll definitely be returning! :)" u"Very disappointing!!!Preface my comments--I'm Japanese from California and lived in Japan for part of my life. \xa0I ordered the Chirashi for $25--I got imitation crab store bought tamagoyaki(rolled egg omelette) and canned shiitake mushrooms on my plate. \xa0I mentioned it to my server and she said she would inform the management of my disappointment--no response. \xa0 Management (Owners) making poor choices to cut cost. \xa0Also the tekka-maki was very poorly rolled--splitting open. \xa0I'm no sushi chef but I can roll better sushi." u"My friend and I had a late lunch and ordered the sushi and sashimi for 2.The servings are really big we can't hardly finish it. I loved the sashimi fresh and taste really good!I especially loved the Green tea ice cream that we had for dessert! Food is good and the service is nice will come back again." u'Got the delivery order from this place and thought it was actually pretty good! Had three sushi pieces - tuna shrimp and sea urchin as well as a small agedashi tofu app. My only complain is that the shrimp sushi was slightly dry...Full credit for the sea urchin really fatty/creamy and carried a bit of sweetness.Nicely done and fast delivery speed! I wish I knew this place earlier!' u"I'm genuinely surprised that this place only has a 3.5 star rating! My office is around the corner so we order from here frequently. The sushi is always delicious and fresh and they have some really unique rolls-- love the one with gold flakes! We have dined in at the restaurant as well and with a large party of 8 we were given a table in a special section of the restaurant that was quieter and had 2 other big tables for larger parties. While dining in the service was quick and friendly. Haru is the only good sushi option in the Times Square area in my opinion!" u'Their online order system is totally screwed up and it wasted 45 mins of my time. 3 times it told me my c card was invalid. 3 times I re-entered all the (considerable) data. 3 times they said it was no good and I should contact Citicard. Finally I did and Citicard confirmed my card was perfectly fine and I should contact Haru. Haru then took my order over the phone and the purchase sailed thru. I\'m real busy and this was a total waste of time. There\'s a dozen sushi restaurants around here and next time I\'ll order from one of them.And another thing - you can\'t order online without setting up an "account" meaning email address yet another password c card # which their system rejects. All I wanted to do was place an order online and go pick it up. Totally user unfriendly.AND ANOTHER THING \xa0- Now I\'ve got the food home it\'s not what I ordered. I ordered hand rolls and got regular sushi rolls which are more expensive. Can\'t be bothered to take it back so I\'ll just throw it away. I only like hand rolls.OMG! I start to eat the sashimi and NO WASABI. If you order to go from HARU check your food before you leave.' u"Came here to use the $20 birthday coupon with the fianc\xe9 and we were both very disappointedAlthough the restaurant was very beautiful and clean the place is so loud. Tables are extremely close together and I can hear conversations from both of my neighbors.The lunch specials were all so pricy. It was more like dinner entree prices. I followed a Yelp tip and ordered the lemongrass soup. I did like the spices in the soup and it had a great flavor. Unfortunately that's the only highlight of my meal.My bento box came about 20 minutes later and it was pretty much cold. Although the portion was big the flavors were way off. My teriyaki salmon was more like salted salmon and it had really undercooked skins.My fianc\xe9 hated his eel entree because the eel was rubbery. He could barely chew it. The entree was also smaller for its priceService was fine but nothing exceptional.We will not be coming back" u'The food was pretty good. However they advertise a happy hour on their website but they do not specify the time. \xa0Apparently the happy hour in Times Square location ends at 6pm. If you can get there before 6pm the happy hour is worth it.' u"We were in NYC to see a few shows and Haru had been recommended to us. \xa0This location was very conveniently located for us both near the hotel and the shows. \xa0Although it is just off of Times Square the mood here is relaxed and soothing unlike the frenzy that is Times Square.We were in NYC for three days and I had my favorite dish of the trip here - King Crab Dumplings. \xa0Never had any dumpling like this before. \xa0The steamed dumpling was packed full of delicious sweet king crab and served with a nice sweet/salty sauce. I can't say enough how much I loved this dish. \xa0We also shared some lobster goyza which were also very nice. \xa0For my meal I had some California rolls \xa0- disappointing because of they used imitation crab And I also had a Phoenix roll which was outstanding. \xa0We had some extra time before the show so all had a dish of the green tea ice cream - very yummy and a sweet ending to a most enjoyable meal." u"I was visiting NYC for Memorial Day weekend and someone recommended Haru. The sushi is the best I've ever had and the lobster tacos are amazing. Will definitely go back." u"I always love the sushi here it's not a fancy restaurant or anything but it's always delicious. I like the tuna tataki the spider roll the strawberry roll and the sashimi is definitely fresh. The tuna and salmon are really delicious and taste amazing. The restaurant itself is very corporate like but for the area what do I expect? Times Square. They have great drinks and bartenders. I didn't have a cocktail this last time but I have in the past and the margaritas both the jalape\xf1o and the pomegranate one were delicious. The jalape\xf1o one is not too spicy but definitely had a kick to it.The red bean and green tea ice cream is awesome. Very flavorful and fresh! We finished the entire thing. I will be back when I am in the area and looking for some sushi and green tea ice cream!" u"I've heard the food is good... BUT i've just been on the phone for 25 minutes trying to place a delivery order from them and they are just incompetent. I continue to be put on hold and then transferred to a new person who then ask me the same questions. Very frustrating." u'Recommended by my friend. Went for lunch with a coworker on a weekday reasonable price with may lunch specials. Very nice atmosphere offers a full bar and an authentic Japanese cuisine. The service was great. My friend is a vegetarian and they were able to switch the sides and her rolls to accommodates her meal. When her lunch came up with crab rolls the waitress quickly came over and sent it back to the kitchen with us having to call her.I had the tofu steak lunch box. It was a lot! I love the tempura! Hot and crunchy and not oily. The crab rolls were good as well as the tofu. I was very satisfied!Exceed expectation. Highly recommend!' u"Service was great ambiance was really nice and the restaurant is convenient for the theater district. My husband and I are vegan and it's really slim pickins here. The miso soup is in fish broth the spring rolls and dumplings are sealed with an egg wash and the agedashi tofu and veggie tempura are fried in the same oil as all the fish/meat products. So... we had the grilled shishito peppers edamame and shared the vegetarian platter = $38. We left hungry and went to Maoz a block away. We won't be coming back." u'Started with the Tuna Tataki which was good but nothing special. Had the Phoenix and park ave specialty rolls. Would highly recommend the park ave and the mango was a nice touch. The Phoenix was good but would have been better with a piece of tuna on top instead of the way the tuna was prepared. Is expensive but the quality of the food and service is good and will be back again.' u"I went to Haru today and there was no wait. Once seated we asked for green tea which was $3! \xa0However it turned out to be the highThen we ordered our sushi which was pretty expensive $60 for a meal for two. The rice was overcooked but after finally finishing the three rolls that I had I ordered a second soup. Miso soup is always my weakness and this miso soup was very cloudy and not mixed very well. Finally for dessert there was nothing hardly any choices besides ice cream. I finally split a banana roll that you dip in liquid chocolate. \xa0This place was not the best Japanese food I've had but not the worst. I would recommend another Haru but not this one." u"This is an old favorite among friends. I always get the rock shrimp and my absolute favorite soup: the hot and sour which comes with a seafood medley and clear noodles. The noodles are a little hard to eat with chopsticks and is pretty spicy but I love it. The sushi is not bad and I like the lychee-Tinis. They also have a good tempura cheesecake. If you sign up to get rewards you receive a $20 birthday coupon! Also I love that despite the location right by Times Square it is a comfortable and never terribly crowded place. It's underrated!" u"They have a beautiful private room - but depending on the amount of people in your party you'll get less attention - but it is quiet (we were for lunch weekday). I ordered tea like many others (FYI 10 person party) and they forgot about mine..even though everyone elses came. BUT. The way they served the tea is so cute. It's in its own little pot with a cute cup.Food wise it was aiite for the price. I chose this Sashimi Salad which didn't taste that good. The fish didn't seem very fresh - not smooth looked shriveled.. I tried a piece of the Beef Negimaki (yumm) from my friend and had Spicy Titanic and Dragon Roll which wasn't really anything special given their price. In all it's not a bad place - I think I just expected more from it!" u"Haru is in between my sister's office and my apartment so it's the perfect place to meet in the middle. Despite being located in Times Square the interior is quite calm and I didn't notice any typical tourists. The seating is a bit uncomfortable with their wooden chairs unless you're a luck one and catch a bench seat. Like most NYC restaurants you won't be seated unless your entire party is present which is a little irritating considering there's literally nowhere to wait around. Your best choice is just waiting outside or making sure your the last one to arrive. I'd recommend the lemongrass hot & sour soup the shishito peppers spicy crab caviar roll and salmon jalapeno roll- I like it spicy. Their cocktails are also quite good like their cucumber gimlet. The sushi's fresh and the staff is speedy. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Haru but because the location is so convenient I'll be coming back. I'll definitely be back with my $20 birthday gift certificate." u'Love Haru Third avenue. Food is great. Friendly atmosphere and nice folks. They have a seasonal menu. For spring there was a great soup with lobster and mushrooms. For summer there are lobster tacos. Have brought kids and they are family friendly. You can dine inside or out. They have a few locations \xa0but this is the one I frequent often. Good drinks too.']
131.Azalea Ristorante,[u"Found this place on Yelp. We were in New York in April. My mom wanted lasagna so I looked up a place close by our hotel. At the time we were walking in Central Park so we were able to stroll over. Wow! What a find. The food was excellent and very authentic! \xa0Our server was very attentive and pleasant. \xa0I had pasta with mushrooms and I was so surprised how flavorful it was! I'm not much of a pasta person so this was a great surprise! We ordered wine with our meal also.It was nice to sit and relax and be away from the hustle and bustle.If you are looking for great Italian food and a place to relax.. Check this place out! Next time we are going to n town we will be back!" u"Disgusting food. Ordered the sausage and mushroom pasta without the sausage. When it arrived it looked delicious. But then I noticed it bad cheese in it which the menu did not state. That is something that the menu absolutely should say for someone who is vegan or has allergies or is lactose intolerant. The pasta had NO flavor whatsoever. It had a gross chewy flavor and was so bland. The mushrooms and sauce were flavorless and tasted old and spoiled. I was scared I was going to get food poisoning if I ate it so I stopped after two bites. I also ordered spinach was overly salted so I couldn't eat it. \xa0I had the bruschetta as an appetizer which was good at first but they didnt toast the bread enough so the bread became super soggy and water logged and I couldnt eat it. These are all such simple dishes and I have no idea how you mess up simple dishes like this as an Italian restaurant. The server was fantastic. I had a drink called the Blood something or other which was so so good! I should have stuck with it because then the next drink I got (i think the il domodoro) was horrible. Also it was SO hot in there. I was wondering why the AC wasnt on. There's been a heatwave the last two weeks. Ramp up the AC! Overall cute dining spot. Good service. Horrible food. And since the food makes the restaurant I will definitely not be back." u"We stumbled upon the restaurant while wandering around looking for a place to grab a bite and get a drink.Our group of 4 sat at the bar and the bartender was so friendly and helpful when giving recommendations.We ordered the Sformatino di Pere - Warm pear and gorgonzola souffl\xe9 served over a parmesan cheese fondue - and it was unique and delicious.We also ordered the Melanzane alla Parmigiana - Eggplant with mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with fresh tomato sauce and cheese fondue which was very good.I wish I had taken photos of the food - but instead I've posted a photo of two of us enjoying our wine. \xa0I would come back for dinner on my next visit to the city." u'Absolutely delicious food. From the Cesar salad to the sea bass just magnificent. 5 stars all the way. Great service too.' u'We were there this past Saturday and although the the food was wonderful the service was lacking. They were noticeably busy both inside and outside but we waiting 30 minutes before we were acknowledged for a drink order. Over all the service was not up to par for our expectation of a Manhattan restaurant.' u"Good food great service. Off the beaten path. Fixed price menu was very tasty but nothing exceptional. I'm happy to give 4/5 stars. Interesting local art on display for sale." u'My Friend and I had the Greatest experience eating at Azaela Ristorante Yesterday before heading to our Off Broadway show matinee .I had purchased a groupon and did actually saved a few dollars because the prices at Azaela Ristorante are a bit high.I ordered their lasagna which was just DELICIOSO and my Friend ordered the chicken breast and it was also quite tasty.The service was Great and we were both satisfied.We will definitely go back to Azaela Ristorante Hopefully will get another deal on Groupon again or Living Socials just because lunch will cost you over 30.00 dollars  and I am not one who believes in spending crazy dollars when eating out.' u'Attentive service pleasant staff. \xa0Good quality food at a reasonable price for Manhattan. \xa0Solid option before a show.' u"SO good!! Everything you want in a good Italian meal. The veal scaloppine was good the chicken was great but the homemade ravioli filled with veal and covered in a garlicky cream sauce was AMAZINGLY and so rich. I'll be dreaming about that dish forever. Service was great they all had authentic Italian accents and were wonderful. Great treat after seeing a Broadway show (and close!)." u"I have walked past Azalea hundreds of times and finally decided to give it a try because of its convenience to Caroline's on Broadway. The service was so/so. We were treated as if they were inconvenienced by our coming in after the pre-theater rush was over. The waiter was inflexible with my request for pasta with the veal so I just ordered the pasta which was delicious. My husband ordered the chicken and loved it. The food was actually wonderful and priced where you'd expect - only exception was the bread - it was completely stale! Our biggest complaint was the restaurant itself it was literally a sauna! It felt like the AC was not on or not working. They had huge ceiling fans that weren't on. NY has far too many restaurants that are better in every way for me to go back to Azalea." u'The service was very attentive. I enjoyed the lasagna. It was very expensive. However I would like to return to try other items on the menu.' u"REAL TIME LUNCH REVIEW!Ordered up Pollo Azalea (Chicken breast stuffed with prosciutto fontina cheese and black truffles in a demi glaze sauce). \xa0Ordered at 1:10pm. \xa0ETA in approx. an hour. \xa0Not too far from my office.Arrived within the ETA. \xa0Very nice delivery guy.However bad packaging as sauce had dripped into the bag and the aluminum container pierced the bag. \xa0Food was hot at some point as the cheese had melted out of the chicken chicken and into the container. \xa0However it was room temp by the time I got it....and I'm only a few blocks from them. \xa0Generous portion of very good bread though....Flavor of the chicken was good as was the browning. \xa0Mostly tender and juicy with some outer parts being a bit chewy (and this would be sections without prosciutto). \xa0Just enough truffles to catch that flavor. \xa0More grated than sliced and layered...though did come across one slice. \xa0Potatoes had no seasoning on their own and we a bit al dente for my liking. \xa0The sauce from the chicken was good and helped this factor. \xa0Broccoli was steamed well. \xa0Entire thing needed a dusting of salt.3-stars as I feel it would be unfair to rank lower without experiencing their service ambiance or more of the menu since there is potential and the pastas look quite good. \xa0I'd be willing to try dining in if someone else were paying. \xa0Delivery again? \xa0Highly unlikely." u"Based on the reviews my daughter and I made a reservation for dinner on a Saturday night. We were excited for a good Italian meal. Unfortunately our table wasn't ready upon arrival. The food was decent but didn't live up to the expectations from the review and the chocolate cake which was to be the highlight of our dinner was a disappointment. \xa0The location was ideal though and the waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly!" u'Had a lovely dinner with family. All the food was great and service was attentive. Extensive wine list. We got in before the after dinner crowd but I could see where this could be noisy' u'Great Staff delicious food... beautiful interiors. Great midtown treasure and perfect for lunch.' u'I ordered a lasagna for delivery and i received the smallest piece of lasagna for $25. I am the general manager for a hotel in the area and i will no longer send my guests to this overpriced establishment. Lasagna was mediocre at best.' u"I've had just about half the menu & everything is so delicious. From the mouthwatering lasagna to the creamy shrimp Alfredo. I moved here a month ago & I consider this my go-to Italian Ristorante! The drinks are made to perfection! Lorenzo the bartender knows exactly what he's doing. The mgr Clara is lovely she comes around to greet you too. Excellent service! I can't say enough great things about Azalea's. You'll have to try it for yourself." u'Get the veal you will not be disappointed and the lobster risotto with asparagus awesome. Ricotta cheesecake best I ever tasted' u"Great experience at Azalea's!!!! Took my wife for an anniversary celebration at Azalea's and then to see Wicked next store.First off the service was exceptional - I wish I had the names of the hostess waiter and staff to personally thank them for the fantastic attention to detail. They asked us how everything was throughout our dinner refilled our water without having to be asked helped us with recommendations etc.Great environment - pleasant warm and very relaxed. You are able to enjoy your dinner at your pace without being rushed.As soon as we were seated we were given complimentary champagne which was such a pleasant surprise. This was definitely a thoughtful and classy touch!My wife and I split the Melanzane Alla Parmigiana appetizer. Eggplant was tender sauce was very flavorful and the cheese was abundant and gooey.I had the Veal Scaloppine which was very tender thin and a nice finish of lemon. My wife had the Chicken Azalea which was stuffed with prosciutto fontina cheese & black truffles in a demi glace sauce - all of her favorites. We not only enjoyed our dishes but kept giving each other pieces throughout!We finished the evening with cappuccinos and dessert - tiramisu for me and chocolate gelato for her!Thank you Azalea for a memorable and sumptuous dinner!" u'Not a big fan of them but not too good and not too bad. \xa0Food is just fine nothing special. \xa0Just went there for their slow night. \xa0Service is ok. Not sure about going back because there is nothing that impressed me.']
91.Casellula,[u"Fantastic place to eat wonderful atmosphere cosy and intimate lighting is very romantic. Decor is just the right balance of simple and interesting. Just like the menu! They had a wonderful selection of small plates and the cheese we had was perfectly ripe. We went for the Chicken Liver this was DIVINE. The brisket buns my taste buds had a party when this was in my mouth! And the Mac and cheese... I would try something else it was a very well constructed Mac and cheese I just prefer mine be made with a very strong cheese. This is a personal preference.Wine Malbec.... Can't go wrong really.This is definitely a must try. You really are missing out if you don't. Great place to take a date! I hope you enjoy this pleace as much as we did." u"Very very romantic atmosphere. My husband and I were seated at the bar and we ordered a $40 bottle of ros\xe9 which a very nice man with glasses recommended for us. We ordered 3 pieces of cheese and asked them to select the ones that would best compliment our wine. They did an amazing job.The only problem was that the portions were tiny. If you're going to serve delicious food please don't tease me with what looks like a sample (hinting at the buffalo mozzarella stuffed peppers). Those stuffed peppers were absolutely amazing. Overall the experience was unforgettable and maybe just MAYBE worth the price." u"Lovely wine bar I came here for a late night drink love it for opening till 2am during the week. They have a good selection of wine and the waitress was very helpful in explaining it to us and let me try before I made up my mind. I also love the atmosphere it's speakeasy but also vibrant at the same time. I didn't have food this time but will come back again to try some!" u"My friends and I fell in love with that cute little restaurant. The food was AMAZING. The cheese person (?) surely knows her thing and recommended us an incredible assortments of cheeses with their sides. I never thought I could enjoy a cheese plate like that. It was something else really! The flavors were subtle and delicate in every meals we had; the burrata the flatbread the mac and cheese and the grilled cheese. That was A LOT of cheese but hey it's kind of the point of going to a place like that!The waitress also recommended us some great wines. Overall we loved our experience from A to Z. \xa0 Give your taste buds a favor and go try it out!" u"Food was so good!! Not only did it taste good but the presentation was nice. I was waiting for a friend at the bar and watched the food being prepared in front of me right behind the bar. It might sound unsanitary but everything was clean the food was prepared quickly and everything looked so good. I wanted to order everything. I ended up getting the Mac and cheese as well as their version of pigs in a blanket. I split these with my friend and they were both very good and i definitely recommend them. They didn't seat me at a table since I got there a little early and they wanted to seat me and my friend together. We ended up eating at the bar anyway but just something to keep in mind. I was out on the list and I was told the wait would be 30 minutes. It was also very busy. It was a regular weekday. The place is small and since the food is good I'm not surprised every seat was taken. If you're looking for a good wine bar in the area and you're not in a rush check this place out!" u"Both the Pig's Ass Sandwich and Mac & Cheese are amazing and worth the hype. But the Strawberry Rhubarb dessert was only passable - the ice cream on top was great and i loved the crispy shell but it was too sour overall. The wait staff was friendly and helpful with wine recommendation.Overall this is a great spot for casual dinner and drinks in Hell's Kitchen. It's pretty tiny so I assume it may get a bit loud when it's crowded over weekends but it was pretty quiet and cozy when I came here at around 7pm on a weeknight. They don't accept reservations so I recommend you either come over weeknights or early over weekends!" u"At first glance thought my soccer mom look and group wouldn't fit into this super cool place but the waiter warmed quickly and the food was fantastic! Dying to go back...for sure next time I'm in town! Convenient for theater district. Mac 'n cheese & Pig's Ass sandwich are a must!! We didn't get a chance to try the cheeseboard but will for sure next time. Looked amazing at a table nearby." u'What a great find. This place is close enough to the theatre district but away from the hustle bustle. Intimate trendy and perfect for a night (date) of wine and cheese. Bottle of wine......selection of meats.....selection of cheese pairings and a salad.....MAKES A MEAL!!!! The cheese pairings were amazing. Fig jam and goat cheese passion fruit mustard and goat milk cheese porcine mushroom and (cheese) caramelized red onion and (hard cheese) dark chocolate spread and blue cheese. YUM!!! They have a huge selection. You get an ounce of each (about 5-6 bites) and bread. We let our waiter choose but you can pick your own. It was just a tummy night cool atmosphere and relaxing.' u"This place is great! We stopped in for some wine and cheese before seeing a Broadway show on a Saturday night. They don't take reservations and your whole party needs to be there before being seated but we lucked out and got a nice little table for four right by the window. We told our waitress we were in a bit of a hurry because of the show starting and that we trusted her judgement to bring us a nice selection of cheeses. She recommended a great bottle of red wine brought 5 awesome and very different cheeses out and the pairings that go with each of the cheeses was almost my favorite part...almost...We also ordered the charcuterie which was 5 meats ranging from a pate to a chorizo. Everything was delish!! A blue cheese paired with a chocolate coconut fudge different sheep and cow's milk cheeses everything brought out was devoured and we got the check quickly as well and our waitress was very pleasant the whole time. I will definitely go back!" u"Love the location right by my office of course - and one of the great wine bars around. \xa0The cheese plates really are as good as the reviews say they are. \xa0Having a reservation is helpful or you can sit at the bar which is small but works for a drink with 1-2 other people. \xa0We had bottles of rose and an awesome meat/cheese plate that staff put together for us since we couldn't make a decision at the time. \xa0This included a Nutella/blue cheese combo that was to die for. \xa0I will definitely be back soon." u"I LOVED this place. I met up with a few friends here for wine and cheese. I had a great white from Abruzzo and my friends all had really good reds. But onto the truly amazing part - their cheese pairings. We split a grand total of six cheeses and they matched each with the craziest tastiest pairings. Most notable was the blue cheese with Nutella another cheese with salted caramel fudge and yet another with apple chutney and an apple chip. (I apologize for not remembering the names/types of cheeses but they were so good I was distracted). We also had the ricotta crostini which were good. A little on the small side for what you pay but still very good. The servers were extremely friendly and were great about bringing us plates fresh water etc. and the food and wine was great as well. Hopefully I'll be back soon!!" u"Casellula is a lovely place for some post-theater wine and cheese in Hell's Kitchen. We dropped by here after a show in Times Square for a nitecap and had a great experience!We got a wonderful bottle of Spanish wine and let our server decide which cheese would be best paired with it and she did the rest! We were good with anything as long as it wasn't too crumbly (personal preference). Our server ended up choosing three great cheeses that complemented our wine. We also got the apple cake which was amazing - just the right amount of apple and pecans.We can imagine that the wait probably goes out the door during peak times as the place is relatively small. With that in mind it's probably better to come here with 1-3 people max as it doesn't seem like they can easily accommodate large groups (unless you're willing to wait). One of my favorite aspects of Casellula was the atmosphere! It's cozy and classy while still being fun and lively. The servers remain upbeat and nice even when the place starts to get packed. Definitely worth another visit!" u'Excellent cheese and win bar. If you have a special place in your heart for cheese like I do make it a point to visit this place. They have a HUGE selection of cheese anything you want they have it. They have a person there (forgot the exact title of this individual) who\'s job is to create cheese plates with appropriate pairings. I have no idea what this person gets paid but they deserve a raise!! My cheese plate was excellent and paired perfectly with all unique things. My favorite pairing was the maple tasting one (not sure what the real name of it was) but it was paired with the blue cheese and it was sooooooooooo yummy. I also sampled some of their meats to accompany the cheese I went with wild boar cacciatorini (which tasted like a less tasty version of hard salami) and another meat that was very similar to kielbasa. The kielbasa meat was much better than the wild boar and also was a very generous portion. It came with a great mustard dipping sauce I would recommend trying this instead. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is not due to the quality of the food but rather the quality of the people that work here. Casellula opened at 5Pm on the day I was there and I arrived at 4:50. It was absolutely freezing in the city this day and they wouldn\'t let us wait inside. Instead they said "sorry we open in 10 minutes" and watched customers stand in the freezing cold out the window as they all stood around looking at their cell phones. They literally made us wait until exactly 5PM to let us inside. I though that was a bad look on their part. I understand you do not open until 5Pm and wont serve us until 5PM that is all understood....but why couldn\'t you let us stand in your restaurant for 5-10 minutes while we waited for it to be 5? I wouldn\'t even expect to be seated I just wanted to stand inside and get out of the blistering cold. I thought this was a very poor judgement call and I was not the only customer to feel this way. There were about 4 other people standing outside waiting with me who also though this was very crappy of Casellula.Casellula treat your customers better. you have an awesome place and I would have loved to give you 5 stars but just couldn\'t because of how I was treated.' u'Awesome chef. Awesome wine. Great food! Def worth a visit in NYC. Try the fennel octopus salad.' u'I want to love this place as it ticks all my boxes Wine and Cheese! but sadly the service was appalling. There seemed to be about 3-4 wait staff for a very small restaurant but their attitude stunk! They could not care if we were there or not and constantly through the night we had to ask to be served. We had to ask for menus ask for drinks ask for meals all whilst the wait staff were hiding out the back and talking amongst themselves. The attitude was rude and lets this place down sadly. On to the wine and food. There is quite a good selection of wines by the glass and bottle and the staff do actually know about wine so feel free to ask about a wine that takes your fancy. We were after a late supper after seeing a show and Casellula delivered. The menu is limited to mostly sandwiches which at first we were dubious about but we were actually really impressed when they came out. They were most gourmet baguettes and were delicious. There is also a nice selection of cheese available.' u'Please read the following as a song:"I like to wine wine wineWith my swine swine swineI want my cheese cheese cheeseGive it please please please. Will hand over my nickeles nickeles nickelesFor those pickles pickles pickles. Try the tacos with shrimp and beans beans beansOne of the best you ever seen seen seen. Hand over that cake cake cakeFor heavens sake sake sake. You got to try it try it try itIf not on that diet diet diet!"Translation of my work of art above:Get that pig sandwich...it\'s dope. Of course you need some wine to wash that sandwich right on down. Huge wine selection so enjoy. Let the knowledgable waiters help you decide if you don\'t know what the hell you are doing like me. The same goes for the massive selection of yummy in my tummy cheeses. The pickle jar is also awesome. Pickled pickles and carrots and egg...yum. Consider the shrimp tacos. They are dense and filling and also have a great presentation. Lastly that cake is heavenly. Obviously avoid if you are being health conco pus this week.' u"This might possibly be one of the best places I've ever eaten in New York City. And I realize that's a very bold statement.Went here recently with a couple of friends (NYC residents) before heading to see a show. Apparently this is said friends' go-to place before hitting up any show. And I can understand why.Now one of these first things you should be aware of about this place is the dining room is very very tiny. I mean seven six-seven tables if I recall correctly along with a few seats at the bar. The second thing you should know is a party is not typically seated until all members of the party are there. So if you plan on meeting someone at the restaurant for a meal just know that.Now the food. While each of the three of us in our group ordered our own meal we did try everything so I'm reviewing everything here first-hand. Here's what the collective group enjoyed:- Lavender truffle popcorn. Yup. If you're thinking this might just be one of the most amazing sounding things on the planet you are SO right. It is what it is - truffle popcorn with a hint of lavender. I dream about it sometimes y'all.- Sausages encased in dough. Think of it as a fancy pig-in-the-blanket. But oh so flavorful and tasty. I highly recommend trying this dish.- Shrimp tacos. - Mac 'n' cheese that is so deliciously cheesy you'll slap your mom. - Roast beef sammies. This was my personal dish and I could not have been happier with my decision. The sandwich came topped with saut\xe9ed onions and lettuce and juicy juicy roast beef. Along with a small field greens salad with vinaigrette. I was in heaven with every bite; if I could eat this every day I totally would.One of the really unique things about this place as noted by one of my friends is that there's technically no kitchen. There's a small area located behind the bar where all of the food is prepared (by one or more chefs I can only assume) which makes this place even more impressive to me.I'm heading back to New York a little later this year and certainly plan on making Casellula part of my agenda." u'What a fantastic find for pre-theater snacks! \xa0We absolutely enjoyed our wine and carefully curated cheese board. \xa0The complement selected for each cheese was perfect. \xa0Who would have thought a cheese could pair so well with caramel popcorn? \xa0To top it off the staff was incredibly pleasant and fun to talk to. \xa0We thought we were just stopping in for a glass of wine and moving on but a few glasses in along with the fantastic food there was no else we needed to be. \xa0Would definitely return!' u"One of my favourite restaurants in the city for cheese and wine. \xa0They will make up a selection for you and you can even tell them what types you prefer or don't like. \xa0Wine selection is very good. \xa0Other plates are good too but I usually end up with wine & cheese plate. \xa0Place is small though so try to get them at off times as otherwise you might have a bit of a wait." u"The cheese and wine are first rate and a couple of the people behind the bar are friendly and AMAZING so I'm not taking about them. But some of the wait staff could learn from Miss Manners. On one occasion one woman (she seemed to be a manager or at least acted like she owned the place) even snapped at my table and lectured us when we only ordered wine. We didn't know the policy that we had to order food as well. We were apologetic and offered to move to the bar but she treated us like we were gum on the bottom of her shoe. Uncool. A little bit of a good attitude goes a long way. This would have been five stars but for the hit or miss service. It seems a lot of people here and on nymag.com also have had bad experiences with the staff so it's not just me. Hope the way this place treats their customers improves."]
74.K Rico,[u'Was here this past Sunday with my friend for brunch. I had the burger and he had the steak and eggs.GREAT FOOD AND STRONG DRINKS!will be back soon! :D' u'We came here after Hamilton about a couple months ago since Yelp reviews are good and \xa0my boyfriend had a hankering for steak. \xa0It seemed like a nice upscale place especially because of the prices! \xa0But there was this girl straight up SCREAMING at the bar about the NBA finals. \xa0We\'d be trying to have a conversation and just hear "THAT\'S MY BOIIII" or a more vulgar version thereof.Didn\'t want to start a scene so asked the waitress if maybe she could handle the situation. \xa0She just shrugged (this girl must have been a friend or employee?) and said she could move us to the front of the restaurant or outside. \xa0Fine but then we were sitting outside summer in Hell\'s Kitchen trying to ignore the bros and the riff raff at more popular places. \xa0Oh and the flies since our table was right next to one of those garbage basement chute things.They seemed to feel bad our service was great after that but why not just tell the girl to simmer down? \xa0Why make our experience less important than hers? \xa0In NYC it\'s much better to go off a recommendation than Yelp (as my boyfriend quickly learned) and I wish we\'d just popped in to one of the busier places.' u"South American Steakhouse isn't necessarily the first thing you think of for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Despite that walked in and was greeted by friendly staff and plenty of space to settle down.Partook in their brunch special - unlimited mimosas/margs/bloody mary for $25 including entree. Considering it's a steakhouse had to get the Short Rib Burger ($4 extra). Thick juicy burger with cheese onions tomatoes and delicious sauce. Wonderfully juicy and put between a toasted bun. Burger is served with truffle fries that are served hot and thick cut. As for the drinks mimosa contains a solid amount of champagne but the margarita is where it's at; super strong.Service here is superb. Guy behind the bar told me about the restaurant and the way they make their meats for the lunch/dinner crowd. Seems like a place that really cares about what they serve. Will absolutely try to come back for a real steak." u"Good location in Hell's Kitchen and the interior looks like. There is a cozy yard behind the main room so you can sit outside if you like too. We came here for Saturday brunch. The menu was short - not plenty of food to choose from. I ordered short rib burger which came HUGE and tasted just like normal beef burger... If you are a big fan of huge burger you should try. But I guess for most girls the size is too big that we have to split it and eat separately. My husband ordered 3-style egg with pork. I don't like the pork but love eggs - but to be honest you can have egg in any style in want in every breakfast place....we also ordered the signature price steak to share. It tastes good! The best thing from the menu I guess. We might not come back just for the steak though..." u'This is a very comfortable neighborhood steak house with some Argentinian flare. Not that the steaks from there - the proud and generous exec chef and owner explains not the best beef is from S American. With the three different ones our table tried it showed - you\'d be hard pressed to get a better steak at any of the big name power steakhouses in the city. Prices are reasonable too. The apps and sides are where the Argentinian flair \xa0comes in - empanadas corn cakes and octopus all prepared with south of the border flavors. The "French fries" - better called potato logs I think are the best fried potatos around too. Nice casual but hip decor friendly neighborhood vibe great server staff and nice little patio out back for cigars or dinner. Definitely coming back.' u"The ONLY reason they don't get 5 stars is because it took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive. We had the sirloin steaks manduros( I would return JUST for this) and Brussels sprouts. So so good !!!totally expensive but so worth it. Tables are very close so it helped that folks were so friendly and talkative. The ambience is perfect. A return is on the agenda!!!" u"K RICO is AWESOME!!! Service is top notch. N\xfamero uno en servicio. Great decor and great staff all around. Our server Deanna was attentive on point and social. Our appetizer was simple but delicious. The empanadas are a great start with a aji Amarillo Aioli. My wife and also tried the the guacamole trio of Pomegranate Papaya Mint & Lime/ Smoked Bacon Chipotle/ Traditional...AWESOME!!! \xa0Three great layers of flavor. My entree: I didn't think that any restaurant I've frequented could match my signature steak which I make for my guests at home which is a beautiful grilled skirt steak but K RICO does it well with their version called Entra\xf1a Skirt Steak served on a hot plate with their homemade chimichurri. Although they didn't have jalape\xf1os as one of my sides they did offer their homemade hot sauce which complimented the steak well. My wife and I had a simple but delicious dessert with a double expresso. AWESOME!!! Executive John P. Greco III hit a home run with us. K RICO will be on the top of my list as one of the best Latin fusion restaurants to dine in New York City." u"Came here for a friend's birthday the service was great given that we arrived late and had a ton of balloons with us. The food was amazing worth every penny. We got the parrillada mixta a NY strip sirloin the tomahawk steak special all of them were delicious. We also brought out own crepe cake and they were very accommodating in storing it and surprisingly the birthday girl even found candles for it! Definitely place to go for celebrations or just satisfy your steak craving!" u'Wow. How amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant becsuse of ambience food quality selection and service. The cod had astounding taste while the sea bass was good the cod was the best I have ever had. The chopped salad easy extremely refreshing while the guacamole was flavorful and different.The service and managers here are seriosuly top notch. There was a slight mishap in our order and he corrected the issues promptly and without fail.Try this place!' u'We just happened to be starving and the thai place a few doors down was ridiculously packed. Good thing though because the food here was DELICIOUS.I had the arepas and plantain crusted cod. My partner had the empanadas with chilean sea bass. Its was all good. The drinks were good (mojito and pisco sour). I was stuffed. Twas a good date' u'Kindly consider that the two stars go to the manager Mark who was amazingly attentive \xa0and took care of business like the real professional and dealt with the aftermath as a gentleman. - the service was non-existent. the waiter came over four times in four minutes to check if we are ready to order and ZERO times for 45 min after that. with his station practically empty (besides us and another table) he thought it was a better time spent with talking to the lovely hostess. \xa0drinks came later than patience allowed and napkins were in great deficit. - the Beet Salad came sadder than "Gloomy Monday" by Billie Holiday and was sent back as soon as we saw it. - the Burger ordered "medium-rare" although \xa0so decidedly approved by the waiter \xa0came nearly well done. the meat had a "taste" and a "smell" of bad quality. \xa0- both dishes were sent back and both times the waiter was nowhere to be found. both times we had to deal with very attentive team of busboys. this was not their job and they handled it with flying colors. the service industry is a large and wide in NYC. if the waiter is on duty it is not my task to let him know what\'s up. All hail goes to the manager Mark who tried to make the sad situation better and brighter. For that i tip my hat! The kitchen and the waiter should seek other places of employment - People come to restaurants to eat and be served. Simple? Apparently not. \xa0I would never recommend this place to anyone. \xa0Mark stay as professional and cool as you are! You are the best thing that happened to K-Rico!' u"My husband surprised me at the last minute to go out & have steak we usually go to Old Homestead but wanted to try something new he also liked that this place has a Hispanic touch to it and isn't your traditional steak house restaurant. We made reservations via open table which there were plenty of times available especially on a Sunday night we drove there and was both very surprised by the amount of parking on the side street had to actually read the signs a couple of times to make sure we will come out and the car will still be there. The restaurant itself isn't that big there were about five tables filled slow music playing on the speakers and the lights were dim we were immediately seated in the back which I was happy about (far away from everyone else) When checking into Yelp you get a free sour drink (there signature drink) which we received right away. We also ordered white sangria they don't have pitchers like other places only by the glass I also noticed that it was made to order other places usually have the sangria pre made it had a weird taste at first but after a couple of sips we realized it was good even ordered two more glasses when the entree came. They also bring out spicy fried crispy pasta yeah I know sounds weird but it was cool.For appetizers we ordered the cheese dish basically melted cheese with a little bit of chorizo I've had this before at other places and enjoyed it better there than here. But it wasn't horrible.Seafood fried dish which same with shrimp calamari fish and scallops I'm not a fan of scallops so they added more calamari. It says it comes with a garlic aioli sauce which they put on the bottom there wasn't enjoy so make sure you ask for more on the side. My favorite out of the appetizers were a platano and chorizo dish it was mashed platano which had a hint of cinnamon in it with fried sliced chorizo it was delicious! Now on to entree I had the charassco since this is a Latin steakhouse I figured they can mess that up and they didn't it was delicious! My husband ordered the New York strip steak which it was good it wasn't steak house quality good. For sides we ordered the manduros which were good something you can't really mess up the sweet potato mash also good and the yuca fries. Dessert- which i don't know how we even had room for it we shared the espresso flan which basically tasted like espresso weird interesting but it was tasty. Service was good I don't know the name of our waiter but he was a heavyset Hispanic man mustache very nice funny personable and recommend a lot of the items we ate. Overall it was good we had a great time and lots of laughs. Can't say I will have to go back can't say that I will think about the food and say I must go but hey at least we tried it." u'Omg fell in love from I got through the door. Got there at 11 pm on Sunday and you know how some hostesses may shoo you away when they wanna go home because the restaurant closes in an hour? None of that. The hostess waitress and bartender service was perfect. The Steak was so tender and juicy and their drinks were great. Even our doggy bag came in a tote bag. It was one of the best restaurants I have been to in the city.' u"Based upon other reviews I was looking forward to dining here and I really really wanted to love it. \xa0My mom and I went for lunch before seeing a show on Broadway so it wasn't very busy. \xa0The service was great but the food is what let us down.To start with the good our server (I believe his name was Alejandro) was very charming and friendly. \xa0He seemed to be doing everything from hosting to serving and even bartending. \xa0He said he had only started a week earlier so we were impressed by all of his hard work and his ability to balance multiple roles. \xa0The food is ultimately what was disappointing. \xa0We started with the roasted oysters which were the best part. \xa0I ordered the skirt steak for my main meal. \xa0I felt as though it should have had a lot more flavor than it did based upon price and other reviews. \xa0The chimichurri sauce it said it came with was almost non-existent. \xa0My mom got the fish tacos and they were pretty boring and the meat was flavorless.I know this place is still relatively new so they could be working some of the kinks out. \xa0While I was disappointed I'd be willing to try out their dinner menu once they've been established a little longer." u"I really loved this place and was thinking either a 4 or a 5 until we were leaving and the coat check lady couldn't find my wife's coat that apparently fell to the floor behind the coatrack. \xa0Fortunately my wife was able to find it on her own. I probably wasn't giving it a 5 anyway but felt the coat check experience was worth mentioning especially for someone reading this who might be undecided about checking their coat. \xa0Anyway the food was excellent. \xa0Although the steaks may not have been as good as those at the best steak houses they do come pretty close. \xa0 Both the rib eye and the porterhouse for 2 were extremely enjoyable. \xa0Our servers were very helpful. \xa0Floor managers make their rounds and interact with the customers which I found to be a very nice touch. \xa0What I liked most about this place setting it apart from other steakhouses were the great sides and appetizers. \xa0 I loved the Grilled Octopus and \xa0Queso Fundido we had for starters. \xa0 The Broccoli & Cauliflower Saute and the Brussel Spouts with Bacon were outstanding steak accompaniments. \xa0I am definitely a fan!" u'Drink: Classic Pisco SourFood: Pozole Skirt Steak (rare) and Brussels SpoutsAs a fan of chimichurri I was not surprised to find the food was all excellent (though overabundant for one). I found the cocktail a bit sweet but it was still well-made. I would go back with someone else and order the same items plus one more main.' u'My wife visited this restaurant and spoke highly of the food and the service so I decided to give it a go. I must say I have not been to many South American steakhouses so naturally I was skeptical. To my surprise this Restsurant has a lot to offer. Not only does it give 3 options to dine in ala outdoor (street corner) indoor with AC and then a backyard still outdoor but with a classic veranda vibe with stars and sky view after sunset. We dined at the backyard this time. Our waiter was great very attentive but I would like to see the waiters give their names though. I stared with the Colombian sweet corn pancake from the appetizer menu and thumbs up to that dish. Of course as a Chilean sea bass lover I gravitated toward that dish. It was broiled as expected and memorable. This sea bass does a good job of exciting your palate by itself so it prudent to keep the fish the star of the dish always and that you did Chef!!! Kudos!My friend Steve had one of the steak dishes and as a steak lover he was impressed at the quality of the meat and the spices. Side dishes could have been better but the appetizer menu totally makes up for the weak side dishes. Plus I got to chat with the owner Tommy. Pleasant guy! Owns a few choice spots in the city so you can feel the vibe of this restauranteur who knows how to please customers. Thanks again Tommy. Keep up the good work!!' u"Went there on Tuesday night because they're closed on Mondays. I had a Pisco sour was awesome. I read the reviews on line. From yelp to triple visor to Google. So I tried all everybody's favorite the empanadas the saut\xe9ed octopus and even the ceviche yes it was a lot of food and I did not. I saw the steaks go by they looked and smelled awesome I sat at the bar for about an hour I'll be back next week just too full from the appetizers to dig into one of those juicy steaks.The deck core looks awesome really convenient right on ninth Avenue happy hour was wonderful at the bar and I'll definitely be back for the steak." u"When it was time for a group of professional friends to gather for an overdue reunion we could have gone for the usual suspects and waited weeks to into Keens or Peter Luger. Instead we went for this Latin American-inflected option. It was a good decision. I'll give three reasons why. `1. Better sides. Although it's tempting just to eat as much as possible in protein your digestive system is better with something else on the side. The workhorses of the American steakhouse the fries the potatoes the steam vegetables are almost always the nadir of the meal. Not here. The South American emphasis -\xa0this isn't really an accurate representation of a steakhouse in Argentina Chile or any one Latin American country -\xa0means much bette options. Yuca and quinoa were great palate cleanser between bites of meat.2. Better flavoring. I had the skirt steak which came with a rich chimichurri sauce. This was one of the highlights of a week in Buenos Aires and it's rather faithfully replicated here. With a bit of better my medium-rare steak was an even tastier treat. 3. Less pretentious. Yes the steak at Manhattan's famous steakhouses are good. But do they have to be such assholes about it? The warm service neither intrusive nor inattentive was a welcome accompaniment. This wasn't the best steak of my life. (I had those in Argentina and Chile.) But it was a great experience from the bourbon drink and the beginning to the Pisco Sour at the end." u"Very nice location friendly stuff. Excellent meat - wow! Foot quality is top. The whole crew is a little bit to aggressive on pooring in wine & water. Pricing on the high side. Below 300$ for a family of 4 is imposible. Next time in NY we'll go there again.Thomas"]
182.Pret A Manger,[u'While in New York my go to place was Pret A Manger. \xa0I was only in New York for three nights and I went to Pret A Manger (various locations) at least half a dozen times. Pret A Manger sells yummy HEALTHY food. The prices are reasonable too. \xa0(I\'m ignoring the fact that the Canadian dollar sucks and that I had to pay an exchange rate on top of it.) \xa0While the prices can\'t be considered cheap (cheap food no longer exists) the prices weren\'t over-inflated. \xa0Here in Vancouver "healthy" food is way overpriced ($10 for a salad?! \xa0Fuck off!) but Pret A Manger\'s prices were on par with unhealthy garbage food. \xa0There was a variety of food choices as well as price points. I liked that if I just needed a little snack to keep my blood sugar up I could buy something for under $5. That\'s rare. Usually I have to decide between unhealthy and cheap or healthy and expensive. \xa0But not at Pret A Manger. I really liked the berry cups veggie sticks with sweet pea hummus and chicken and edamame cups. Perfect for a small snack to keep my blood sugar up. Everything also had the calories listed (I think it\'s some law in the States) so you could make wise decisions. Most things were fairly low cal and even the odd item that had a high number of calories was still healthy. I really wish that Vancouver had something like Pret A Manger.' u"This is my new go to spot when I'm at work! The coffee is always fresh and the prices are great! I used to go to Starbucks on my break but not anymore because I found Pret!! The customer service is amazing! All of the employees at this location are always very prompt warm and they make you feel great! David and Glennis are amazing! They are the reason that I switched from Starbucks!!! I mean the coffee and prices are great too!!! Thank you David and Glen for being such amazing people and always making my day!! You're the best!!!-Danny (I work at The Gap)" u"This Pret A manger is clean and spacious. There are lots of sitting space at the back of the cash registers. In addition you can see what is going on in the streets by looking at the windows if you are in need of motivation or to be curious on what people do nowadays. The customer service is good as they are polite and helpful. I mistakenly dropped my coffee's cup lid and they replaced it immediately. The plain croissant in here is crispy fresh warm and very tasty." u"Thanks so much to Yeissy and K for the free Admit.me team lunches! Not only were they super helpful but they were courteous and HILARIOUS! You've got 3 lifetime customers" u'Last stop after a full afternoon of eating and shopping in the city. Before heading home I really needed a good fresh cup of coffee. This was perfect! :)' u"This Pret a Manger is quite spacious. There's another section of seating in the back behind the cash registers and you can basically lounge out. It's great.I ate a fruit cup here (specifically pineapple with lime) and the pineapples were rather sweet to my surprise. Fruit cups can be hit or miss and given that it was like $4 I was hoping it would be doubly good.The front has the coffee where you can serve yourself. But I think as it gets later in the night they start to run out pretty fast but it looks like they will brew more anyway." u'This is my favorite Pret. \xa0The staff are always so cheerful and their sandwiches are always so delicious and more flavorful than any other sandwiches I have ever had. \xa0 One time I did get a Green Goddess Turkey wrap with no turkey on it which bummed me out but their amazing Bang Bang Chicken Wraps and Cheddar Sandwiches make up for it. \xa0 I love Pret so much.' u"Friendly customer service and good food. Their chai latte is not bad but I'm not a fan of their oatmeal." u'The morning staff here is so friendly!! Which is very appreciated because everyone is cranky in the mornings before coffee. The place is neat clean etc but the staff makes it worth it. They are also very quick with the drink orders.' u"OK \xa0I'm obsessed with most of the people that work at this Pret- they are literally amazing ! They always remember me and are so super sweet it feels like a little pick-me-up whenever I leave here. After the mamacitas at the laundromat told me I gained weight I started bringing lunches and not coming to Pret as much but whenever I do make it in they always remember me! If a manager is reading this I don't know what you're doing to maintain such a great staff but keep doing it!"]
12.Shake Shack,[u"This is my first visit to Shake Shack and overall was impressed with the experience and quality of food. \xa0It was a rainy day in Manhattan just before lunch and the squad needed a place to grab a bite and keep dry. \xa0Wanted to eat somewhere that would satisfy everyone in the group and this was a good choice. Server was a little cold at first but we persisted with our friendliness and conversation and she perked right up and started smiling maybe food service workers in NYC need to be treated with a little more respect and kindness but I digress.Grabbed a few cheeseburgers and fries two shakes and a couple of beers (!). \xa0Burgers were tasty could have been bigger and due to the great flavour didn't last long. \xa0I liked the crinkle cut frozen fries more than I would have expected. \xa0Shakes were expensive but good.Washrooms clean by NYC standards. Adequate seating though got busy but the time we were ready to leave. \xa0A couple of families were wandering around with food looking for a seat." u'I get it it\'s Shake Shack and they have developed an almost cult-like following and has become a tourist mecca. Why not build one in a convenient spot for the thousands of tourists that fill Times Square daily? It makes sense and it is just a short 5-10 minute walk away from the hustle and bustle.I don\'t get the hype. It\'s a burger at the end of the day. Its a good burger but was it worth the 10-15 minute wait in line? Probably not. The "Shack Stack" is for the burger purists with its beef patty cooked nicely set on a well texture potato bun. The lettuce & tomato were fresh cheese perfectly melted and stacked nicely. It was good. Just not great.The Fifty/Fifty lemonade and iced tea was watery by the time it was served and the ice melted through. The tea came through with a bit more bite than the sweetness from the lemonade. The shining moment came through with the vanilla shake. It was well done and the one reason you should visit. The custardy cream blended with the vanilla flavor was well done with a creamy texture that was hearty yet easy to consume.Service is where I\'m 50/50 and ultimately brings me to this 3-star review. The hosts were helpful but not necessarily pleasant. There was one particular host taking orders that was extremely friendly and helpful. If they could clone him for all of their staff it would be first rate. Instead most were rather rude and abrupt. After waiting 20 minutes for my order I inquired and was told in a terse tone "we\'re really busy." No follow-up or checking just that. 10 more minutes passed and when I inquired again she shrugged and I finally asked for a manger. The manager was much more helpful and apologetic.In the end its a good burger that you\'ll have and when it comes to visiting New York you have to visit. If time might be an issue or meals are at a premium skip it. Or skip the burger and hit the cold line and get a shake...it\'s really where they shine.' u"Yet another Shake Shack I've visited ... not necessarily by choice but I digress.This review is really 3.5 stars ... Overall I give the food 4 stars and the molasses service combined with the sometimes unruly guests due to the limited seating capacity a total of 3 stars.The food itself is what you'd expect. \xa0The burgers are juicy the fries are solid and the new chicken sandwich is pretty delish. \xa0I like it pretty much the same as a Chick fil A sandwich ... The issue for me here is how insanely slow the service is even for a Shake Shack. \xa0Since things are made to order I definitely expect a decent wait for my food but on multiple occasions I've had to deal with folks literally forgetting my order. \xa0On top of that the staff isn't exactly as fast/sharp as I've seen in other locations and the high volume of people in this location is seriously annoying. \xa0It gets too crowded by a certain point due to the huge number of people waiting inside for their food and the spillover goes into the seating area which seems to be exacerbated by the generally slow service here. \xa0I'd say if you're dying for Shake Shack go to another location." u'Such a clean large location in the Theater District.Long crazy lines because of the location. Food takes a bit but not super slow. Hard to find tables during meal times. Shack Stack - $9.59 - TINY AF! But the best burger they have on their menu. The shroom patty adds a gooey cheesy burst with mushrooms. Cheese Fries - $3.99 - Love the old school crinkle cut fries. Cheese is melty. They are garbage compared to animal style fries though.' u"Decided to give this place a try! Shake Shack has been on my to try list for awhile! Finally being in the city I knew I couldn't miss out.I'm definitely going to say believe the hype! It is good! The burger is quite delicious and looks pretty small but it is actually quite filling! I couldn't even finish my fries and I didn't eat anything prior to that that day. I was delighted by the fresh taste! I got their special of the week  the cookies and cream shake and it tasted like cookies and cream! It was so rich and thick! It tasted just like that flavor!!! I couldn't finish it but that was because I was stuffed from the burger and fries! \xa0Since this location was in Times Square it was quite packed and it was very hard to find a seat! You definitely have to scout out a seat and I went at 3:30 pm which wasn't even lunch time. So I believe they do need more seats in that particular location.I recommend checking out shake shack!" u'I\'ve been hearing soooo much about Shake Shack. "Oh you have to try it it\'s wayyy better then In and Out burger" Blah blah blah.So I\'ve been super stoked to try Shake Shack! We waited in the long line and got a Shackburger and Smokeshack with fries and a peanut butter shake. Okay the taste is definitely good for these burgers! The fries reminded me of being in elementary school where you have those crinkly fries which were good. And the peanut butter shake is great! But why are the portions so small???? I figured I just needed one patty in my burger and I was content but not full. For the amount you pay it\'s not worth it I believe we paid about $22. Isn\'t fast food supposed to be cheaper cuz dayum that\'s expensive! I\'ve tried the hype. I have been here and ate the food. No knocking the food it tastes great. But because of the price I\'m not sure if I\'d come back.' u"Shake Shack is an okay choice if you're nearby. We were encouraged to give it a try and I can say that their mushroom burger is really amazing however the rest of the experience falls flat. I'm inclined to believe that this is partly due to the Times Square proximity this location resulting in an abundance of traffic with lines forming past the building. In their defense the lines do \xa0move rather quickly and staff members are plentiful however like almost everything else in New York City space is limited so plan on taking your food to go if you're dining at peak times. Shake Shack specializes in burgers fries and shakes. The staff is very friendly even cracking jokes with us at 10pm.The food is okay a \xa0definite step up from Burger King or McDonald's but not anything particularly special. I'd dare to say that your town's local burger spot could easily contend with Shake Shack. Our order was accurate and food was okay. I'd be willing to give another Shake Shack location a try probably a quieter one." u"Knock Knock. \xa0 \xa0Who's there?A frickin' overhyped effin' overpriced frackin' overrated perfututum underwhelming lame letdown with 20-minute line 15-minute wait and no seats to eat a bescumber buggerballs burger fartknocker fobdoodle fries and sard scobberlotcher shake for trailer park eff drunk elves and frickin' get ... different ... FRACK!! \xa0 \xa0Who?Shake Shack." u"Either because I'm oblivious I don't often eat in this area and/or I don't actively seek out Shake Shacks I didn't know there was an outpost here. We saw its bright lights on the way to the subway after seeing a Broadway play & while the long quick-moving line was tolerable we took our food to-go to avoid being part of the mob scene longer than necessary. A handful of SS locations have seen me order the same thing but this time my usual order a portobello mushroom burger was exceptionally crisp & delicious; and instead of squeezing out the melty cheese inside like I usually do its mild cheesy flavor actually tasted good to me. Winner winner! Probably wouldn't choose this location again but I'd choose their portobello mushroom burger again in hopes of it tasting exactly like this one." u"Shake Stack is one of the best burgers in the country. It has a portobello mushroom cap on it that's been stuffed with cheese battered and fried. Across the board the burgers and food are awesome. Go get ya sum" u'As a true + loyal fan of in n out. I was already skeptical of the place before I tried it. When in New York one must try Shake Shack so we obliged.This location is always packed at all times. I somewhat likes that it was crowded. V recommend Smoke Shack- applewood bacon + cherry red pepper topped off burger ( so good my friend stole mine) -_-***Shack Stack- shroom burger with meat patty (see my pics) Shroom Burger- (vegetarian) cheese stuffed portobello mushroom burger French fries- cheese on side because it can get salty' u"This is the first time eating at any shake shack establishment and it was a so so experience. Food was good. \xa0We ordered chicken shack single shack cheeseburger \xa0strawberry and black and white shakes. \xa0My kids had the crispy chicken shack minus the spicy mayo and they liked it a lot. They rarely like anything. \xa0One enjoyed the chocolate shake while the other didn't like the strawberry shake. \xa0I tried them both and they were good but i expected to be blown away by the rep they get with their shakes \xa0and was little let down. \xa0I enjoyed my cheeseburger and fries were good \xa0but I've had better. The sandwich sizes could be bigger for what they charge! We were the first on line and for some reason the 4th customer to get their food! \xa0After ordering you get a beeper and come up when you are beeped. \xa0I notice that other customers got their food first \xa0so i went up and asked and the food came shortly after. \xa0The staff was nice enough though. \xa0Order mistakes isn't acceptable anywhere especially at this location because families have time constraints to eat quickly and go to the theatre! Another complaint is their lack of bathrooms. \xa0There were 2 single bathrooms where you need a code from your order receipt to enter. \xa0The bathroom line was long! \xa0A pet peeve of mine is when customers take their time to do their thing especially when they know other people are waiting. Inconsiderate! I would come back to eat here despite my bad experience because my kids like it age they open early but would temper my expectations. \xa0You should too." u"Finally tried the famous shake shack. After a Saturday night show this is the place to be.The line was super long but it moved really fast. They had figured out a process to keep things moving. I tried the fries nothing special to me. I also had their only veggie burger which I think it was good but not extraordinary. The milkshake was sooooooo sweet that I could not finish even a quarter of it. I think maybe all milkshake is like that and I just don't like milkshake at all?" u"This location is very busy - right in the theatre district and walkable from Times Square. It is definitely easy to find. I never park in Manhattan so I suggest taking the Metro or walking. I really enjoy Shake Shack in general. Good burgers and good shakes. Prices can be a little pricey considering how small the burgers are but I think they're delicious. For my most recent visit I tried the Shake Shack chicken sandwich. It was a decent sandwich but definitely no Chickfila sammich! Service was pretty fast even when the line is long. I would definitely come back for its burgers!" u"This ain't no in&out! The line is long but it does go fast. The menu is on the wall and quite frankly I thought they'd have more type of signature burgers. Seats are hard to find since it's overly crowded. The burgers came out and it was mediocre IMO. The fries were fat and I'd rather have skinny crispy fries. The bread was good but it could've been more juicy and have more sauce. Overhyped especially if you've had in&out before." u"Hang on to your receipt! It's your key code to use the restroom!I love me some Shack so we had to hit up this one on our way back to hotel around midnight. They close at 12 so we hurried to this location as the others closed at 11. Fast friendly service with a full house of hungry patrons. Try the new chicken sandwich. The spread and perfect pickle are amazing but the chicken is juicy and cooked to perfection. \xa0Always get the Shack hotdog but skip the bland burger. Fries are great and get a cup of cheese on the side to dip them in. The shakes are very thin and disappointing but hey get one just in case ;)" u"My only complaint about this place is the long lines. But if you're not in a rush the line is well worth the waitTheir burgers are good but what I go for is the chicken shack which is a crispy chicken sandwich. It's so bomb and dare I say better than chick fil A chicken sandwich." u"I don't see the big deal. \xa0Maybe it's the only burger place in the area? \xa0Because take this burger anywhere in Texas or Oklahoma and it would certainly not be the best in town. \xa0It was fine but I don't get the crazy lines because I can think of about 50 better burgers. \xa0The fries were mediocre just not top quality. \xa0If you are visiting from out of town skip the crowd and go somewhere else." u'I love Shake Shack. I love the mushroom stuffed with cheese on top of a beef patty burger.Only thing I didn\'t love was the cashier girl\'s attitude when she didn\'t hear my bf say "diet" coke and he asked if she could exchange the normal coke for the diet. That woman rolled her eyes so far back her head she saw her brain.Lady - I hope you work at Shake Shack for the rest of your life.Other than that I still love the burgers ya\'ll make :)' u"We came to eat here waited for longer than one hour and half and the crowded place w loud noise doesn't let you to enjoy the foodThe funny thing was whenever I found a space to seat for myself and my other two kids a waiter came and said a group of nine people reserved here this table and the I noticed that the customers pay about 20 dollers under table and hidden to waiters to be seated I hope the owner finds this out and let the waiters go...Very unprofessional"]
67.Hibernia,[u'This review is about 2 years overdue. This is my favorite bar in Manhattan. Amazing bartenders and service food is great (quesadillas are top and check the specials board for lamb stew in the winter) soundtrack is amazing dancing on tables shots out of a shoe on your birthday.Definitely go.' u'Cool bar and upbeat music. Lots of sports memorabilia hanging against walls and ceiling. Lots of drafts some very good. Very chill attitude and friendly service. When we tasted the bread pudding we ordered we were asked how it was. I didn\'t want to lie and reported the bare truth: it was completely burned on the top virtually inedible. Eddy immediately took it off our check and apologized. Although the dessert was bad he didn\'t have to so it. "I just want you guys to be happy and this is the least I can do." We weren\'t even regulars and he showed us a degree of care you rarely see anywhere else. I call this outstanding service.' u'This place is really a gem. I usually go on the weekends which is sometimes jam packed or othertimes with a few locals. Either way the bartenders are always happy and seem like they are enjoying serving you. There is also great music and people literally dancing on the tables. No joke! Just want to give props to this place for making everything so much fun to go to.' u"Came here to catch a Steelers game because well this is a Steelers bar. After coming here I am definitely partial to the one back home in the DMV. 1) Space is very limited here. We were in line with some other fans about 30 mins prior to opening (noon) which was still a solid 1.5 hours before kickoff. The place filled up by 12:30. 2) There's only 1 big projection screen accompanied by several small TVs. Definitely not the size of screens you would expect in a bar. 3) The food is extremely mediocre. Sure it's bar food what do I expect? But this was one of the more bland bar kitchens I've encountered...4) This place really likes to blast music when the Steelers score or there's a big play - which is totally fine and cool but when there were penalty flags thrown they wouldn't shut off the music. Which meant no one could hear what was going on. The song would play to the end...5) I will say the service was very attentive. All things considered still a haven for Steelers fans on game day but certainly not my general bar of choice." u"Such a fun place! I loved the music they played! The bartenders are awesome. \xa0We danced all night. Everyone there engaged themselves in the music and laughter. I didn't try their food; but I will one day. My \xa0friends and I had a blast. Will go back soon!" u"Only go here if you like: -Live Sports - particularly the Steelers (Hibernia has a sweet setup for NFL soccer MLB games and more)-Great Music - lots of people singing and dancing!-Eurovision-Great Burgers nachos Irish Fry-Up tater tots and great food-An awesome mix of fun NYC locals and tourists from around the globe-The best and most attentive staff in the CityIf you like any of those things you're going to have a great time at the best bar in Manhattan." u'Falling into the "casual bar" category (not exclusively sports and not a dive) Hibernia is in a league of its own (see ATMOSPHERE section below). But I\'ll save you the lengthy paragraphs and provide the cliff notes:-Bartenders/staff & service: A+++ (The two main bartenders are Scottish learn your name and order quickly so you feel like family every time you come in)-Food overall: A++---AUTHENTIC LAMB STEW---Quesedilla---Wings---Balboa (steak sandwich)---Toastie (grilled cheese w/ chips and salad for $6)---Appetizer sampler platter (perfect when you went too hard on the pregame)-Drink selection: A. (small joint so not too much on tap but the crowd pleasers are all there)-ATMOSPHERE: Time of day here is key people. Hibernia can be whatever you want to be. ---Is there a game you want to catch? It\'s on. Doesn\'t matter what country it\'s happening in or what ball they\'re playing with. Hell they even had a huge party for Eurovision last year which involves no balls!---Dinner crowd a little later on? Yup---Happy hour crowd just after that? Yup---Girls dancing on the tables to Backstreet Boys even later then that? HELL YUP (if you love 90\'s music and Boy Bands THIS is your place).---Is it your birthday? You get to take a shot out of the infamous high heel shoe! (don\'t worry it\'s clean and replaced frequently ;-) )This place means a lot to so many people (saw a Proposal one time). Been coming here just over one year now and should have written this sooner but who wants to give away there best kept secrets too soon??Come in. Regardless what you\'re coming for you won\'t regret it.' u"Why am I even telling people about this place?!?! I really just want to keep Hibernia to myself! What a fun bar! The drinks are strong and reasonably priced the bartenders are efficient and friendly and the music is so much freakin' fun! A mix of hits from the 80s through today with a little Golden Girls theme song sprinkled in! I could not stop dancing! On the tables. That being said this may not be the bar for everyone. It's definitely not see-and-be-seen it's not the kind of place if you want to be all serious and macho. But if you want to let loose have fun sing and dance this is totally the place for you. Can't wait to come back!" u"Its a nice bar i guess but we were looking for a place to dance. We walked in and sat deciding on what to drink because my friends were already drunk. The security comes and tells us that we need to order something if not then we're gonna get kicked out. If it wasn't so cold outside i would have left but we just ordered some mozerella sticks and 2 drinks and got out of there once we finished." u'This place is one of my staples in the Hell\'s Kitchen neighborhood. They have a nice sports crowd during the day (Steeler fans must come during Football season this bar gets packed and die hard fans are fun to be around). At night it\'s like a dance party with people dancing on tables myself included and the bartenders cheer along and are very approachable. Eddie is a sweetheart! And if it\'s your birthday they give you a complimentary "shoe shot" where you drink a shot of Jameson from a festive green high heel. So bad but really fun. Love this place.' u"I've been to Hibernia twice-- last night being the second time-- and I've been equally satisfied on each occasion. It's a good ol' Irish bar serving all of the staples. Friendly bartenders great atmosphere and clean bathrooms all add up to a great time. I haven't eaten the food beyond a bite of a friends corned beef on St. Patrick's Day but even that was great. It's centrally located within walking distance of Time's Square. You better bet you'll find me here again!" u'I\'m not normally on the hunt for the next "great bar" but this place was great. My friend and I were looking for some good cheap eats and we stumbled upon this place (thanks to Yelp). It was a slow night people may have been clambering to see the Pope regardless this spot was perfect. Our server was this sweet blonde girl (with an Irish accent?) we didn\'t get her name but she was fantastic! She was very attentive gave great recommendations. It was a cool fall night and she recommended the french onion soup it was fantastic and boy was there a good amount of cheese. We started with the nachos and after having been there for a while notice it must be a hot commodity due to the amount of times we saw it being served.The nachos were amazing it didn\'t have queso but came with cheese dip on the side which was a perfect pair. The chips were crisp and delicious and without the queso topping allowed the chips at the bottom to not get soggy so good. All and all it was a great meal and with beer added to the tab didn\'t pay more than $20 a person. Also our server engaged us in conversation asking what our plans were. When we told her we were going to see Avenue Q (amazing btw a must see) she had chatted with a coworker and came back to us saying how much we were just going to love the show. Great experience I will definitely go back when I\'m in the neighborhood!' u"Fun!Hibernia is a 60% chill bar vibe / 40% dancy / clubby vibe (people can dance on the tables) without the pretentiousness of meatpacking.The bartenders are friendly and make strong drinks the wings are great and if you're with a group that just wants to dance you can sit at the bar drinking a beer / eating wings while your friends dance on the tabletops.The bartenders act as the DJs at the place and the song selection is mostly NOT top 40. At least not too 40 NOW but great throwbacks to the 90s / early 2000s. Perhaps a reflection of the age of the bartenders or just a shoutout to the music of that decade...we all still greatly enjoyed it." u"Why doesn't this place have more reviews?No matter the occasion you can dance on their tables. And no one will complain. I've probably caused more problems here than solved but I'll be back for more shenanigans.Hibernia a staple of Hell's Kitchen and should be part of any bar crawl/dance night out especially with hours like they have. The bartenders will get you what you want and then some." u'Night and day from our last Eurovision experience. Our friends recommended checking out Hibernia after the disaster that was the bar we went to last year.The bartenders and staff were so nice and friendly even though they were clearly overwhelmed. It was standing room only and was packed before the show even started. They were clearly into the show and dropped balloons from the ceiling when the winner was announced.Thanks Hibernia for restoring our faith that American bars can do Eurovision right!' u'I can summate Hibernia as such: A good happy vibe with personable bartenders including a hot Irish one that was singing "Ain\'t No Mountain High Enough".Also big bottles of Magners and the creamiest White Russians* I\'ve EVER had.* - Yes we\'re still talking about drinks here.' u"What an awesome place! Great personable bartender (Lorraine) that wants to make you happy. Love that they have actual seats with a back and not bar stools at the bar...that's really important for us old peeps! LOL! Great deviled eggs!" u"I come here whenever I am in town normally to finish out the evening. \xa0The food is wonderful (yes I have had it sober :P) and is always a good portion. \xa0The bar tenders are great and remember you (I don't know how I can't remember my own name sometimes). \xa0I am from out of town and stop in a few times a year and they remember me. \xa0Like any bar its the people that make it great and this is the rule here. \xa0Unlike some NYC bars the regulars are cool to out of towners as well. Eddie Jeff Aiden and the crew really take care of the customers. \xa0This is a must stop on a saturday night people dancing on tables is the norm." u'Finding a good low key pub with a neighborhood type vibe and above average bar food is hard in the Hells Kitchen. You\'re right next to Time Square which means chain restaurants and bars at every corner. But after a friend bringing me once I finally found my ideal watering hole for these parts.Enter Hibernia.Awesome bartenders all with a heavy pour hand? Check.Great bar grub? Check.A laid back fun atmosphere no matter if it\'s a quiet Monday night or a busy Friday night? Check.Hibernia isn\'t gonna blow your socks off in terms of beer selection ambiance bar fare etc. but everything they have going on is above average (especially that Rasher sandwich. Two words: bacon heaven) and it\'s overall just a great spot to come with some co-workers buds etc. and just kick it and have a good time.Plus - what says "happy birthday" like taking a shot of Jameson out of a studded leather heel (reference my pic).' u"A very cool Irish pub in HK!The Wautresses and Bartenders are really cool.Drinks are good. They usually have good music.Food comes in great portions and is pretty tasty drinks are very good and the atmosphere is super nice.I'd recommend it if you like small spaces. They even have some outdoor seats.Def a chill place!"]
192.El Centro,[u"El Centro what a cool place. The food was super nice. Apparently this is - very - a popular date place! Colourful with small tables and intimate atmosphere. I don't recommend the sangri-ita (?) the drink that is a combination of a margarita and a sangria! To much of the good stuff? But food wise - the portions was very big - and really juicy! The tacos and the tortillas dish with melted cheese topped with grilled steak was so good (!).Yum!. I will absolutely miss (amazing) Mexican-american food here in Scandinavia :D" u"After many failed attempts to eat here my friends and I finally landed a table at El Centro on a quieter evening. I ordered the 3 cheese and chicken quesadilla while my friends ordered the shrimp tacos and chicken chilaquiles. My quesadilla was hearty flavorful and not light on any fillings. One of the best I've had in the area.Service was just OK. The servers are nice but they aren't terribly attentive. We didn't get refills on water or chips throughout the meal. Ambience is cool inside. They have an entire wall filled with cool figurines the tables are made from bottle caps and the chandeliers are beer bottles. You are often seated very close to the table next to you but it's not different than any other restaurant in Hells Kitchen.Overall great Mexican food. There are a lot of options in the area and I'd say El Centro is at the top of my list. The menu is vast so I'm looking forward to trying it again!" u"I'm a serious Mexican lover and this place left more to be desired.I'm a huge fan of guacamole but for $8 the portion size is way too small. Seemed like only 1 avacado was used in the making of it. But the complimentary chips and salsa were great. The salsa had a nice flavor and the long strips of chips had a great salt ratio!I really wanted a vegetable dish but I'm allergic to mushrooms and I was told there was no way to take them from the dish The refried beans seemed like black beans not pinto and were charred I'm some areas. Rice was okay could use a little more flavoring. Quesadillas were too greasy but the mixes of cheeses tasted very good. Probably will try other Mexican restaurants before returning." u"Really good Mexican food and margaritas - what's not to love? Came here with friends on a Saturday night and had to wait about 20 minutes. Not terrible considering the time of day and we were expecting a wait since I usually see a big crowd here. Despite them being busy the waiter was attentive and food/drinks came out promptly. I got a large mango margarita which has a good kick to it so you definitely get your money's worth! For dinner I got the chicken chilaquiles which were to die for! It was really filling so I couldn't finish it but was so sad because I wanted to keep eating :( It's not super cheap here but it kind of depends what you order too. Overall I felt it was worth it and will definitely be back here!" u'4 stars for the food.I had the taco trio and it came with rice and beans. I ordered a fish taco shrimp and Pork. Loved the fish and shrimp the pork was dry not that great.Fianc\xe9 had the steak plate and love it. We ordered drinks the mojito was pretty good the sangria was a bit too sweet for me tasted like juice. They serve chip and salsa dip with the drinks.' u'Came here before the RK Bridal trip... probably not the best choice for "pre- try on a tight ass dress that is supposed to symbolize the happiest day of your life" but you know whatever #ThugLifeThe food was decent not life changing same with the drinks. Basically everything you would expect from Latin food in Manhattan. I did appreciated that it was a bit more traditional and none of that Chelsea Upper Eastside fusion let me put kale on your taco bullshit. The restaurant itself was colorful and seemed like a fun place to linger for drinks. I would infidelity stop by again if I was in the area.' u"Best beef steak tacos ever! The shrimp isn't bad either. Prices are high here; it's a super popping place." u"What a pleasant surprise: a good meal for a reasonable price in theatre district! I was dismayed by how few economic options for decent Mexican there were in midtown when a friend suggested this place. It's small it was crowded and it was noisy. But the food was yummy portions were good and price was 2ish bucks under what I would have assumed given location. Drinks were good as well. The recipes had some fusion and modern changes so it is not cuisine you would get in Texas but it has the traditional favors ingredients and concepts behind the food." u'Wonderful wonderful place for Mexican. You need to try the chilaquiles!!! Portions are huge and the margaritas are great. Reasonably priced for midtown and def worth with the amount of food you get!' u'Came here after rehearsal at a play I\'m currently in and I was hungryyyy. I tagged along with another friend of mine and they said they were going to el Centro which is a Mexican place and I didn\'t Want to eat alone so I was like why not! Upon entering its a pretty cramped place and there were about three other tables there (one large group took a huge table) and we sat in the middle.SERVICE: was kind of slow we waited quite a while for our food even tho it want crowded but then again we came at 4pm for a "super late lunch" so...FOOD:  I heard their quesadillas are good and I got the chicken one. It was REALLLY good BUT I couldn\'t really taste the cheese. It had LOADS of chicken and sauce and the Flavor was really strong but again I wanted the cheese more. I tried my friends just plain original cheese quesadilla with nothing on top and surprising it\'s actually really good and LOTS of cheese and its amazing. I don\'t eat Mexican food much so I probably won\'t come back but I will say I like the cheese one. FUNNY FACT: i had the chicken ones for leftover and I\'ve gotta admit they taste 10 times better than the fresh ones lmao. TIP:ask for extra cheese! Free!' u"We stumbled upon this place walking into Hell's Kitchen. We wanted Mexican food and the restaurant looked pretty crowded so we figured it would be a good place to eat if they were able to fit us. Upon minutes of walking in they seated us at a small table in the middle. Right away we were greeted with menus water and complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were perfectly salted and crisp not greasy at all. The salsa was ok tasted a bit like tomato sauce could have used more chunks of cut up tomato or jalape\xf1o etc. I took a risk and ordered something I'd never eaten before chilaquiles with grilled chicken after a highly recommended suggestion from our server while my boyfriend ordered a burro hellicioso burrito. The meal took about 30min to arrive but just as my boyfriend was saying if they took one more minute it would be too long they plopped our meals in front of us. \xa0Keep in mind this place is NOT good for photos. Very dim lighting at night but the cool trinkets on the walls and the crown lamp shades would probably be much more photogenic in the morning.While I could barely see my meal it smelled fantastic and I was immediately happy with what I ordered (I tend to be critical about presentation.) \xa0My meal consisted of layers of chips soaked in a delicious creamy cheese sauce with perfectly cooked chicken and creamy avocado on top. Like nachos but way way better. My boyfriends burrito was tasty as well. Good use of spice and great flavor but next to my dish his looked boring. He definitely dug into my food afterwards when I got too full because it was such a huge portion!I just got back from Mexico and I miss the amazing food so will definitely be returning here soon!" u"Wanted to try a new Mexican place late on a Friday night. This spot was not only open but buzzing with a bunch of people and good looking plates. Sat down in the corner and got some free chips and salsa to start. The salsa here has a very surprising kick that you don't usually get at other places. Ended up ordering the Mushroom/Pepper Quesadillas ($11) and a half carafe of sangria to share ($18). Quesadillas are hearty - packed with mushrooms and the right amount of pepper. Sangria isn't too strong and paired well with the meal.Service here is fast despite the crowd. Didn't like the mirrors around the wall too much as I don't want to observe my fatass eating. Solid stop that I'll probably come back to." u"Warning: Beware of the Margaritas. They are strong and hit fast and hard. But let's be honest that's exactly what you want. I came here last night with a large group of girlfriends and we had a fantastic night! As someone who doesn't frequent Mexican restaurants I decided it would be safe to order a Papi Chulo (large) margarita (Tequila is my alcohol of choice always) and the Baja Shrimp tacos. My friends' orders all varied from Chilaquiles? and probably every other taco option on the menu. All of us were more than satisfied with our meals and I felt as though the prices were somewhat fair. Overall we had a good dinner out and I would definitely maybe come back even though Mexican is not my food of choice. The only thing about this place: they do not take reservations and will not seat your party until all of you arrive. I find this a bit annoying when you have a group of 7 standing outside waiting in the cold on one other person but could not even have the option of reserving a table at a specific time in the evening. The place is small so I understand but it just seems as though there is not a compromise on this topic." u'Came here for dinner last night with the parents after a very long day of moving.It was fairly crowded but we were seated right away.Ordered a margarita that was perfectly fine (nothing stellar but would order again) and then a sangria (preferred this to the margarita).We also ordered the chorizo nachos and the mushroom and pepper quesadilla. I liked how the nachos were served in a bowl....more to scoop up all the goodiness with! Also the quesadillas had a really good flavor to them.Our waiter was super nice and friendly and attentive.Definitely will come back here!' u'One of the best Mexican Restaurants out there. I always get the shrimp quesadilla which is very tasty. The atmosphere is very welcoming a vey nice vibe. The margaritas are good but a bit pricey.' u'Ran into the restaurant with some girlfriends for dinner and drinks after work. Was a little annoyed with the whole table situation because they would not seat 3 of the 4 girls - eventhough we would take the same amount of table space. The skinny margarita initially was super salty- order it without the salted rim! They are only 75 calories!! WINNING! Ordered about 3 of themThe tables were unique and interesting they tops were decorated with bottle caps of mexican beer! It was a nice atmosphere lots of people in groups coming after work for a drink and a bite.We ordered 2 orders of guacamole the gauc portion is tiny. We also ordered the tacos which were delicious - I got the chicken and 2 of my gfs ordered the steak. Taco portion was also tiny- a little disappointed about this. Service was great! The waiter was attentive and helpful in helping us decide. I will come back for the skinny margaritas!' u"The shrimp oaxaco cheese quesadilla is probably one of the best quesadillas I've ever had. The margaritas pricey but strong and delicious. Casual atmosphere & average 25-30 minute wait but worth it!" u"Always loud but always good! The steak nachos. The steak nachos. The steak nachos! They are the best I've ever had. Hot spicy and perfectly comforting. Service and drinks is also on point." u"I'm reviewing this place after many many visits. This is our go-to Mexican place and we bring everyone here. Now that we can only get our fix when back visiting New York we make sure it is part of the schedule. The food is the most important thing but the decor is fun too. The music is good and at a level to be prominent without making it too hard to hear what your companion is saying. The waitstaff is friendly and efficient.The grilled vegetable chilaquiles are sublime. We almost always get them and feel we really don't need anything else to be happy. But we have ordered a few other items and have certainly tasted many more. The roasted corn is delicious the vegetable tacos the guacamole...everything we have tried (all vegetarian) has been great!The waitstaff will give you chips and salsa that are so delicious you will almost spoil your appetite. Almost. Regardless of the quantity of chips I eat I am always up for chilaquiles. Wisely on our last visit we took some of the dish home because there is just so much and I still walked away stuffed.This place is always packed and you may end up waiting for a table but it is definitely worth it. One of our absolute favorites in NYC." u'Good place to get some Mexican food. \xa0Burritos were on point - my carnitas burrito was excellent. \xa0Space is a little cramped but liked the open windows to get fresh air. Overall solid especially in this area.']
82.Annabel,[u"It's a sad Cinco de Mayo when you have to admit to yourself that you no longer have it in you to fight your way to the front of a bar at a Mexican restaurant for cheap hastily blended margarita. But such was our lot tonight. We sadly ambled down 9th Ave until we found Annabel with sexy lighting and one more open table left. We found delish cocktails - the Lili with spicy tequila yum! - an outstanding arugula salad pizza perfection with mozzarella spinach and pancetta and wonderful service...truly a great find. Can't wait to go back and sit in Tyler's section again." u"Fun brunch spot that takes reservations (on OpenTable)! My group of 7 enjoyed their assortment of omelets benedicts and big ol' pizzas. Mimosas are $7 and strong and the bloody mary mix is made in-house. Kudos for running several different credit cards for us." u"Amazing little neighborhood gem as we stumbled upon this place on the random.Great service (Ryan) was very attentive and on point.Ordered a couple of appetizers 1) grilled octopus which was phenomenal 2) truffle risotto (on point) and a couple of entrees including a pizza and the lamb shank (being one of THE best I've had) Definitely a must the next time we hit up NYC." u'Came here again for dinner I love this place because its pizza and puffy bread are soooooo yummy. Service is also very good too.The only thing is that the starter is extremely small portion even though they taste great but I think the starter is overpriced. Loved the Brussel sprouts though! I will come back here without doubt but just need to know what to order!' u'Good pizza and nice atmosphere. Kinda hoity toity on the pizza ingredient combinations but good nonetheless. \xa0The one with blueberry duck prosciutto and arugula was my fave. Pretty nice spot over all and decently priced.' u'***Absolutely delicious Great service***Wow. This place will hit the right spot for sure. I was recommended this place by a friend and it is a definite winner. I would definitely recommend to try this place out for a date night or even to catch up with a friend. Cute seating area and during the summer you can be seated near the open outdoor area.' u"Great place for brunch!! Very low key with great food. They have a brunch happy hour $5 wine but I just got a mimosa ($7).The poached eggs and omelets are awesome. It comes with fresh fruits and potatoes on the side. I would also recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes. Super delicious when it comes out hot. Overall the service is very friendly. The food is fresh and cooked nicely. There is also outdoor/window seating and should be taken advantage of when the whether is nice. Compared to other popular brunch places it doesn't get the same amount of attention but the food is equally well made :D" u'Great decor lots of sunlight coming in from the restaurant front windows. Very comfortable benches and seating. Good service.Fried mac and cheese?! Yes please. Fall off the bone ribs?! And an egg :) at 11a. Thank you' u"Cute little brunch place in Hell's Kitchen. \xa0Came here with a party of 5 - great place for brunch as well as for groups. \xa0The service was very good everyone was very helpful and nice. \xa0The waiter was very patient with us as our entire party did not arrive at the same time. \xa0There was a little hot pepper spill and everyone was very apologetic it wasn't anyone's fault but they were very nice about it which I appreciated. They have some good drink specials and happy hour deals. \xa0Pretty good beer selection as well!The Food: Our entire table got pizza because the pictures looked so good! They're individual pizzas - four large slices and were all absolutely delicious! Overall I would say two pizzas could easily feed three people possibly four. \xa0But we went ahead and each got our own and had lots of left overs!Pizza with gruyere applewood bacon eggs brussels chili flakes - $18I absolutely love a runny egg on my pizza and they are generous with their eggs which is awesome! So much goodness in one pizza I loved it.Pizza with spicy andouille sausage broccoli rabe - $17The spicy sausage was delicious! Great flavor. \xa0Pizza crust was good too!Overall had a great experience here the food was delicious the service was excellent I would recommend this place to others and come back here again!" u'Was invited here for a date while in NYC. We had several glasses of red and whine wine. \xa0For food we ordered the meatball appetizer and then the Andouille Sausage and Broccoli Rabe Pizza. Both were good but I enjoyed the meatball the most. \xa0The atmosphere was hip and trendy. Service was awesome almost too much...lol... they just kept pouring the wine and before you know it you can get a little buzzed.' u"Annabel you had me at duck prosciutto.Walking into Annabel you can't help but be enticed by her sexy curvy bar and honey colored woods. It's a very elegant looking space.I can't put a finger on this place great wines great tap beers and a pizza oven making some outrageous pizza combinations. I sit at the bar while waiting for the rest of my party. I order a happy hour tap beer a chocolate stout. This isn't like a glass of Ovaltine its a dark rich beer. They also offer a happy hour IPA keep it. I'm not a fan of IPAs. They do have a crazy beer selection lots of great choices that's not your mass produced beers.The rest of my party comes and they're all interested in one thing pizza. The Duck Prosciutto with Ricotta and Blueberry chutney is calling us. How funky does this sound?? The cured Duck Prosciutto is sliced thin it has a more flavorful taste then ham prosciutto. I thought the blueberry chutney would throw it off but they also add arugula to the mix. Arugula adds the peppery component and pulls it all together.They also brought a chili oil to the table which I was totally fiending. The second pizza we ordered was a Gorganzola taleggio and mozzarella pizza. Say Cheese!Another home run hit this pizza was a cheesy dream.We all left full and happy. Annabel is should be considered if your looking for a great:Wine barHappy HourArtisan Pizza" u'A sleeper of the neighborhood place. \xa0Nearly always seats available (shh!). \xa0Full disclosure: \xa0I\'ve only been there for brunch -- but four times (in a neighborhood where one could brunch nearly every Sunday at a different place and not repeat for months).What brings me back time and again for brunch? \xa0The quality of the food of course. \xa0The roasted pork scarcely needs to be chewed -- it melts! \xa0And a wide variety of brunchy pizzas -- owning themselves as pizzas and not hiding as "flatbreads" -- assert themselves with innovative ingredients. \xa0From prosciutto with blueberry chutney to eggs/bacon/brussles there is something to gratify anybody\'s aching buds.Tight cocktails and a rotating menu of curated craft brews too -- and waitstaff knowledgeable about all of the above.Can you think of a better way to spend a couple hours on Saturday afternoon?' u"This place is super cute. I came for brunch last weekend and my friend and I ordered the pizza with Brussels bacon and egg that was good. The ribs with poached egg and Mac and cheese was salty and sounded way better than it was. Also I would say this place is 2-3$ to expensive. I think there's so many other places to go in Manhattan. Don't know if I'll be back. Just okay." u'Came here for a family brunch on a Sunday afternoon. What looked to be a pizza place turned out to be even better. We started with the pizza that was basically breakfast on a pizza. It had a runny egg which I love some veggies bacon and it was amazing. Unfortunately I forget the name of my entree but my description and picture will help you. It had two dry rubbed ribs which were great and fried mac and cheese squares. Yes fried mac and cheese. It also came with a poached egg over a coleslaw. The dish made me think I was down south which was great because I love this type of comfort food.What made this place a 5 star restaurant was the waiter. I believe his name with Brian. He was very witty funny and knew his stuff. When going over the desserts he made us close our eyes and describe what the desserts were like. We had a chocolate mousse tiramisu and a cheesecake. All three were great but to me the tiramisu was the best of the three. I would definitely come back here for brunch and have already told a few people they have to join me too.' u'It is an inexpensive absolutely delicious hidden gem! The pizza is great - the drinks are yummy. \xa0The only reason I took away a star is the noise factor - not sure if anything can be done about that though.' u"Annabel had a really solid New Year's dinner. I really liked that it wasn't prix fixe like most restaurants are for New Year's celebrations. The ambiance was really nice and warm and they decorated the place with festive balloons and provided noisemakers party hats etc. Order the truffle oil mushroom pizza it is divine! The appetizers were decent but more about presentation than portion size. Their drinks were very good and pretty original. Their desserts were mediocre. I'd come back here though for sure." u"Very tasty pizza. \xa0A strong 4-star pizza had that great pizza quality where I always wanted one more slice (even after eating too much). \xa0Toppings are creative and really tasty and the cheese sauce and dough are all very good and marry well together. \xa0Got two varieties and both were outstanding. \xa0The brussel sprouts appetizer was just ok but that's not the reason why you come here. \xa0Drinks are well overpriced at regular menu price but the happy hour is reasonable. \xa0Overall one of the better pizza places in midtown." u"Though we live in the neighborhood last night was our first time at Annabel. \xa0I really liked it!The service was good-- our waiter kept checking in but didn't rush us. \xa0They had a very nice amber beer for $7 Happy Hour price. \xa0I love it when restaurants have happy hour prices!The appetizers were very good crab cake is a stand out. \xa0Our ricotta cheese pizza with tomatoes and arugula was very good. \xa0We felt chill and happy. \xa0What more do you need?Oh one suggestion-- the interior is very rustic and very relaxing and pleasing-- but the sign outside simply does not match. \xa0It looks too cold and commercial. \xa0You should change your sign to a more inviting design." u"We went to Annabel for Valentine's Day dinner. \xa0We loved the atmosphere--very warm and romantic without trying too hard. \xa0I also really liked that they offered their usual menu instead of a price fixe menu. \xa0And they had happy hour specials... on Valentine's Day! \xa0Abbey the bartender was great--friendly and attentive without being overbearing.The restaurant had a good selection of craft beers and lots of options during happy hour. \xa0We ordered the mussels to start. \xa0The portion was large but the sauce lacked a little flavor and would have benefitted from more garlic (but the crostini was amazing). \xa0For my entree I had the eggplant pizza. \xa0Again great portion and the crust was very flavorful. \xa0However the pesto really wasn't needed on the pizza and some of the eggplant slices were overseasoned. \xa0My husband had the lamb and gnocci. \xa0He said the gnocci were delicious but wished they weren't slightly burnt. \xa0Similarly the lamb was flavorful but a little overcooked. \xa0The chocolate mousse was the star of the show. \xa0Just order it.Overall this place had a great vibe. \xa0We'd go back. \xa0The menu was excellent and the flavors were good but execution fell short at times." u"Stopped by here to have dinner with 2 of my coworkers.We decided to be piggies and got drinks and pizza. We were able to share 2 pizzas and 1 cured meat dish but were all stuffed by the end of the night. We came here after a glass of wine at another bar and the waiter was very helpful with our selection of cocktails. I forgot the names of all the items however my drink had lime and was delicious. The pizza are amazing! This is a place a would bring my boyfriend or friends visiting New York because there is no way the pizzas won't hit a spotDescriptions of the PizzasPizza 1 : Caulliflour pork belly and onionsPizza 2 : \xa0Brussel sprouts Egg and bacon.Lovely ambiance and elegant looking space I love working so close to you!"]
99.Poulette Rotisserie,[u"Got takeout here for dinner one night. Ordered the 1/4 white meat chicken meal with a side of brussel sprouts for $10. I also was intrigued by the salt and pepper wings so I got an order. The math on the wings isn't the best $9 for 6 wings... Womp. Loved the rotisserie chicken! Loved the salt and pepper wings (even with the price). The wings stayed crispy on the walk home and were covered in nice coarse salt. Ya i loveee salt! Brussels sprouts were not good. Didn't finish. Will definitely go for a different side next time." u'I am reviewing the newly opened Poulette on 49th Street. I really wish it was better. I want them to improve but I found it mediocre for the price.I had the 1/2 chicken meal with 2 sides for $18.The chicken was too dry and needed some sauce or gravy to liven it up.I ate the dark meat first there was not enough flavor and was not juicy enough. I had to get the sea salt and mayonnaise out of the fridge to make this meal edible. I \xa0did like the string beans and mushrooms that was the best thing the rice and veggies were just OK. The people who work here are super nice \xa0and efficient the food was delivered fast and came \xa0hot. I think they need to brine the chicken and cook it about 20 mins less. Hey guys tweak your recipes we want you to succeed in this location.' u'I don\'t get why this place gets 4 stars. I\'d be careful in using the lines "Very French". It\'s regular rotisserie chicken no different from what you get in the supermarket. The sides ratatouille and brussel sprouts weren\'t great either.Customer service was good though. The person was nice and far from rude.' u"Not a huge menu selection but their chicken caesar salad was delicious. It tasted very homemade. They give you a huge bowl filled with lettuce dressing and a ton of rotisserie chicken on top. The chicken was great quality and fresh. I'm going to come here again one day." u"You absolutely cannot go wrong with the rotisserie chicken combo here! Half chicken with 2 sides is $18; quarter chicken with 1 side is $10. For sides I recommend their ratatouille - it is to die for! and the string beans and mushrooms is also one of my go-tos.To top it off they deliver fast if you live around the area! It took my food less than 15 minutes to get here! Translation: Amazing!I'm giving it four stars bc I've never been in person / can't say much about the physical dining experience." u"I love my protein especially my rotisserie chicken so I had to check this place out:White Meat - A little dry a little cold. I suppose I can blame Seamless for the cold part. On the upside they get points for seasoning.Mashed Potatoes - Flavorful yet light. It wasn't too salty like the mashed potatoes from Boston Market." u'For $3 off thelevelup.com/c/EM-UYD7\u2026The small side of quinoa & kale (with some tomato & onion) was a satisfying snack and with the free drink with social media share a better healthful bang for the buck than I experienced with chicken at the UWS location.Transaction Amount $4.90Total Rewards -- $4.90$2 Happy Hour -- $2.00$3 Return Visit Reward -- $2.90Total Balance $0.00' u"One of the best spots I can recommend for delivery in the Hells Kitchen area. It's not too pricy delivery is quick and the food comes hot and tasty. The chicken is just really good quality and I like the option to order two sides as well. I would recommend the brussels sprouts if those are your thing. \xa0I've ordered here a handful of times and continue to be satisfied. Give it a try!" u"The food is below Boston market standards and is double the price for some reason. The portions are a joke for amount they charge. You will probably leave hungry and need to go somewhere after To get more food in order to be full. The cashiers also use a paying system where they expect you to tip them for doing literally what McDonald's workers do which is take your order and hand you the bag of food. It's strange they expect a tip for this type of chipotle inspired take out. Paulette is a true disappointment :(" u'Delicious chicken and sides and great service. The service is great very friendly the chicken is perfect simply delicious. We tried their 1/4 chickens and red roasted potatoes and mixed green' u"Ordered a whole chicken and salad for lunch with my Co worker. When it arrived. It was a huge a disappointment. The chicken looked good but It was very bland! \xa0Worst than a rotisserie chicken in the supermarket bland. I swear \xa0if we didn't have ketchup and salt left over from other lunch orders. \xa0We would've starved that day. The salad seem like it was a few days old but they tried to covered it by putting parmasan cheese on it.In addition to that \xa0the sprouts we got felt like it was from a frozen bag or reheated because it was all smushy when you bite into it. \xa0 The only thing that was cool about this place was the boxed packaging. \xa0Other than that it was a huge waste of money." u"Take it to go salt and pepper wings . They also have buffalo and bbq . Trying it out now at home. It's awesome I have a Wing play this close." u"I've been here for lunch twice. The first time I got the 1/4 CHICKEN + 2 SIDES (mixed greens and the ratatouille). The food is very clean and they serve very generous portions so you're getting the bang for your buck. Stay and eat here if you can it makes the dining experience a bit better since they have such a nice homey and bright layout. I had the chicken salad delivered to me a few days ago and again a very generous portion of mixed greens and the right amount of vinaigrette. I wasn't a huge fan of the salad sadly I felt it was missing something and after mulling it around in my head as to what could've been added to make it better I think CROUTONS are the missing key ingredient that would really bring the salad together in terms of texture." u'More like 2.5 stars.I stopped by here for dinner on a Saturday and it was dead empty which is probably because they are more popular for lunch or takeout/delivery. I got the wings with buffalo sauce and a side of brussel sprouts. The wings were pretty good but the brussel sprouts were too soggy and had too much tarragon. My bf enjoyed his chicken sandwich but the side of chicken soup he got was WAY too salty. It was really as if someone just dumped a whole pack of salt into the soup. Overall I think the chicken here is pretty solid but other dishes were really disappointing.' u"I love roasted chicken so I love Poulette. It's a hidden gem on 9th. I have only had lunch here once but loved it. You can find my picture in the list. I had the quarter dark chicken with green beans and mushrooms along with red roasted potatoes. $12. They also provided a herb garlic mayo sauce for dipping which was delicious but you don't really need it. The green beans were incredible. So fresh and crunchy with soft chopped mushrooms. I liked the potatoes that had a light seasoning. The drink options are limited but they had Snapple tea tap or bottled water and a few soft drinks. It's a small place but it packs in the deliciousness! Check them out!" u"Very tasty. Very frenchy. Love it. I'm coming back to try all the sides.Just a little something. Hope they will try to make the chicken a bit crispier." u"Mediocre would probably describe my experience with Poulette. \xa0Coworker and I both got the lunch special - 1/4 chicken with 2 sides for $11.They have multiple though somewhat boring sauces - sriracha hot sauce herb mayo ketchup mayo spicy mayo ketchup etc. \xa0Hot sauce is pretty much Tabasco-ish.I opted for the healthier white meat option - it wasn't the juiciest breast I've ever had but it wasn't far too dry either. \xa0Loved the well-seasoned herb super-crispy skin!They have many options for sides and in retrospect I should probably have tried the ratatouille. \xa0I'd like to point out that the portions of sides are quite hefty. I got the kale and quinoa salad and brussel sprouts. \xa0Kale and (red) quinoa salad was refreshing but did not have enough dressing. \xa0I love red quinoa so maybe I'm a little bit biased. \xa0Not much kale to be found but there was a good amount of avocado in the salad which I was not expecting. \xa0Brussel sprouts... in my opinion were overcooked/mushy and I was not a fan of the seasoning. \xa0Tried my colleague's herb roasted red potatoes - way too dry and didn't taste like much. \xa0The herb (I think rosemary?) reminded me of a candle or potpourri or something. \xa0The string beans were decent but tasted like straight up butter which then ruined my appetite for them.Staff is friendly. \xa0Free lemon-infused water as well.Poulette was an okay meal but was nowhere near satisfying. \xa0I'll have to think about whether or not I would choose this as my lunch spot again." u"If you want a delicious hot meal that won't break the bank then go here. They have great lunch specials. We ordered the half chicken with the ratatouille and salt and pepper wings with mashed potatoes. Let me tell you..the salt and pepper wings are definitely some of the best ever! Deliciously crunchy and seasoned to perfection. My husband who usually doesn't like to eat wings were fighting me for them. The roasted chicken was also pretty good-juicy and flavored well. They also don't skimp on the sides with loads of mashed potatoes and ratatouille. We left warm and happy with our bellies full." u'A new favorite in NYC with the best roasted chicken and excellent side options! Friendly service!' u"This chicken's pretty decent.I didn't actually try the regular rotisserie chicken but I did try a bunch of other stuff which was all ok:- Wings ($6.25 for 6)I asked for the Sesame Glazed and the friendly cashier was nice enough to suggest getting half and half so I could try both flavors and I was able to taste 3 of those and 3 of the Salt & Pepper. Both were pretty tasty but didn't really have a satisfying amount of meat on the bones. The Sesame Glazed were quite sweet and sticky while the Salt & Pepper had a good amount of seasoning and were dry and just a bit greasy.- Ma Grosse Poulette Sandwich ($10)This was a bit of a disappointment as I expected some of the hot juicy rotisserie chicken on here but it is instead comprised of cold meat which is almost like a chicken salad. The baguette it was on was quite good with a nice crunchy exterior but the chicken just wasn't so great.- Brussels with Tarragon and Marcona Almonds ($3.75)This was an ok side. There wasn't much flavor though and it seemed like they just threw a bunch of the oily almonds into the mix without much seasoning.- Herbed Roasted Red Potatoes ($3.75)These were pretty bland. The only reason we got these was that they didn't have the fries available. I would skip these and hope there are fries when you go.Service was friendly and it's a nice little spot to grab a quick snack. They have a bunch of specials for cheaper meals during the week like a deal for a quarter chicken with 2 sides. You could do a lot worse in this area but it's also not a place I would rush to return to."]
26.Melt Shop,[u"I just started working in the neighborhood and forgot my wallet the other day. While I was searching around for spots that take levelup for payment I was delighted to see Melt Shop pop up. I could have opted for it's healthier neighbor - but sometimes you have to treat yourself.Grilled cheese is one of those things that you can easily make at home but finding a satisfying gluten-free grilled cheese that I don't have to make myself is always such a delight.They can do any of their grilled cheeses on GF bread - except for the fried chicken sandwiches.I got the Maple Bacon - and it was a truly perfect experience. The bread was a great size buttery and golden brown and did not fall apart the way that some GF bread options do. The cheese was melty perfection and the maple bacon was the perfect balance of salty and sweet. Their brick spread - which I believe is a spreadable cheddar delight - just added another level of hot wet cheesy goodness.Also I got $2 off for my first time using levelup at this location :)It is going to be veeeeeery dangerous being so close to this spot!p.s. I believe they use the same fryer for their tater tots that they use for their fried chicken - so those with very severe reactions to gluten may want to skip the tots and just indulge in the sammies" u"This location was kind enough to let us order about a half hour before they closed and let us stay a few minutes after their closing time while they cleaned up. I decided to treat myself and buy whatever my heart fancied. I was surprised at the total cost. Perhaps I should have been paying more attention... It costs about $17 for a three cheese grilled melt side of tater tots and an oreo milkshake. I realize now that it was too much for me but I went in really hungry!The grilled cheese wasn't bad. It was a bit messy dripped (oils/grease I guess?) each time I bit into it and it wasn't quite as memorable as I hoped. Pretty difficult to mess up tater tots but they put this topping on it I don't know maybe it's some sort of garlic seasoning but I hated. Would order it without it next time for sure. As for the oreo milkshake well it was pretty good and I had no complaints there. Overall the location is nice staff is friendly but the food is so-so--not bad but not great. Worth trying if you're into custom grilled cheeses." u"I tried this place out when I was visiting New York. I must say it was very impressive. I had the loaded tots which where amazing the maple bacon grilled cheese and the hamburger grilled cheese. Everything tastes really great. I must say the maple bacon was the best but I would have went there just for the loaded tots. It is a small little spot. You go in walk straight to the back and place your order then they give you a buzzer while you wait for your food. You seat yourself and once it's ready you can pick up your food. Didn't take very long and the location wasn't very packed. We did go an hour before closing which was ok. For it to be in time square it closed pretty early. I think it closed around 9 or 9:30. It was a little pricey for grilled cheese and tater tots but I feel it was worth it. I would definitely go back and recommend you try it if you want something quick and on the go." u'Lines move quickly and efficiently. The employees are very nice and helpful. If you are looking for a big greasy grilled cheese sandwich this is your place. I thought other reviewers were exaggerating about the amount of butter on their sandwiches but I witnessed it first hand today when my coworker ordered the 3 cheese grilled cheese sandwich. It was a big size but the grease dripping from the sandwich was just a little unbearable. When she removed the sandwich out of the box there was grease everywhere. She hesitantly took a bite and said it was delicious but she was unable to finish it due to the large amount of butter all over the sandwich.The tomato soup I had was delicious and comforting.' u"Pretty good sandwiches. Be prepared for a food coma though especially if you get the tots along with a sandwich. I came here with a few coworkers one day for lunch. It was really packed but we were lucky enough to find a table for the six of us.It's a little confusing. You order all the way in the back and you pick up your food near the front. I didn't have a lot of time to peruse the menu before ordering so I asked the cashier what she would recommend. She said the most popular sandwich was the fried chicken grilled cheese sandwich so that's what I ended up getting along with shop tots and an unsweetened iced tea.The service was pretty quick. I got my food within 5-7 minutes of ordering. The tots were extremely good I highly recommend getting them. The fried chicken sandwich was good but not incredible. The sandwich was too oily especially the bread. The fried chicken was cooked pretty well the skin was crunchy but again too oily. Overall a solid lunch spot. Great tots good service and good sandwiches. If I do come back next time I might give the truffle sandwich a try." u'If you can\'t get into your first choice for dinner always have a backup! Since we didn\'t want to wait in the cold for Ellen\'s Stardust Diner we rounded the corner to Melt Shop where there wasn\'t a line. The fried chicken sandwich was delicious albeit a little on the messy side. The chicken was cooked perfectly and definitely seasoned better than Chick-Fil-A. \xa0I hope to see a West coast expansion soon.Best of all we were in and our quickly to catch our 8:00pm show of "She Loves Me" at Studio 54!' u'Gluten-Free ReviewChronic gluten freeness at this spot be sure to check if out if your in the area and especially fi your staying at the Sheraton Hotel Times Square. Hit Gluten Free on Yelp and this place popped up during the blizzard and I hopped right in and got so many things. The cheese tots were my favorite but the melt in your mouth meltshop sandwiches + being gluten free are nothing but amazing goodness in your mouth.This place is gluten free approved and you guys need to come to Texas and open up a few please thank you.' u"I work near this place and I never thought I would be into a grilled-cheese sandwich shop but I'm addicted. \xa0They have variety in their menu from Burger sandwich to Fried Chicken Sandwich but my favorite one is the Maple Bacon sandwich which tastes so sweet and good. \xa0It was so good that my sister almost ate all my bacon with one bite when I brought her here. \xa0Something I have noticed wIth everyone I have brought here they all compliment the toasty bread after their first bite. \xa0The Fried Chicken one is good as well but I order that one when I'm really hungry.They also have other things on the menu like tots covered in cheese which is really popular. \xa0They also have the best shake in N.Y. which is the Nutella shake. It is the perfect combo for any of the sandwiches here." u"When I first walked in I got that Shake Shack kind of vibe. It's actually a very neat place with a few seats. The employees were friendly and courteous. They were even nice enough to make my meal to-go when I had originally asked to stay. They didn't make a face at the sudden change and I was glad that they were so polite about it. As for the food I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and I liked that the tomatoes that were in it were juicy and sweet; it made up for the fact that the chicken was dry. Onwards to the tater tots that I had been looking forward to when I found this place. I ordered the cheesy tots and I expected the cheese to be nice with that flowing liquid look but one bite of it and the texture was like cheese paste. Even thinking about it now makes me sick a little. I would suggest maybe going for the shop tots instead. All in all it was a pretty decent place to grab a bite but there was nothing spectacular about it. My friend really loved the burger that they offered so maybe I'll give the place another go just for that." u'I enjoyed my grilled cheese. They have gluten free bread that was cooked to perfection. The service was fast. The atmosphere was clean. Only took off a star for the cheese taste I was expecting more flavor.' u'We stopped in here for a quick lunch. The food is simple tasty quick and affordable. That generally makes me happy especially when I am just looking for a casual lunch. There are a couple of two tops and a few picnic tables. Not a lot but many people got their food to go so it was not a problem.You order at the counter at the back of the restaurant. Then you take a seat and wait for them to call you up. I ordered the Classic as a hamburger. The burger comes on toasted white bread topped with American and cheddar. The burger was simple but tasty. I enjoyed it. The cheeses worked well together.For my side I chose the Cheesy Tots. I am a simple man and love tots. The tots come smothered in cheese. Not good for you but I certainly did enjoy it all. I left full and happy.' u"Looking for a cheat day place? Or are you a grilled cheese fan like me? Well this place is filled with cheesy and carb goodness. Also a great place for a windy cold day like today. I got the classic with the caramelized onions and tomato. Could have I made this on my own and not spend $7 on it sure. But it was delicious and it hit the spot. I also got the side order of the shop tots (tater tots with parm sprinkled on top). That too is nothing fancy but I liked how it wasn't overly greasy. It was crisp! Which I liked. I wanted to dive into getting the tomato soup and pickle but I stopped myself. Maybe next time. The staff who worked there (well at least the one at the cashier and the one who gave me the food) were super sweet. Can't go wrong with friendly smiles. The surprising thing was I didn't feel like I overly stuffed myself afterwards. I was satisfied but didn't feel gross about it (considering it was buttery and cheesy). It's a place to def try out!" u"I'd probably round this review to 3.5 stars.Wanted to try a new spot for lunch around midtown - why not a place that has items covered in cheese? \xa0Haha sadly what I assumed was reality. After a few bites I quickly grew tired of it and everything felt overly heavy. I didn't even finish my meal :( It's also overpriced. Lots of seating in the restaurant -- you can grab a seat after they give you one of those buzzers for when your food is ready. Be careful of where you sit if you're going during the winter - the wind stopper doesn't really work all that well aka everytime someone opens the door the wind stopper door stays open for about 10 seconds (I ate my entire meal with my coat on).For $16 I got a truffle melt cheesy tater tots and a tomato soup. The truffle melt basically only had cheese truffle oil and arugula. I probably could have done with wayyyyy more arugula to cut all the fattyness. Maybe I should get a protein next time? The melts with only cheeses guarantees that it becomes very heavy and boring. I have to say though the bread was nice and crispy.Tater tots were good nothing special though! I actually wished the cheese drizzled over it was like the cheap kind you get at movie theaters over nachos that's slightly runny...the one that they use kind of dries over the tater tots immediately and turns into this weird consistency.Tomato soup was A+; semi-chunky and has a little kick. Good as a dip for your sandwich if it starts to feel a little too oily!***I don't think they offer this right now but I'd probably be more inclined to come back if they had half sandwich + soup combos!!! One whole sandwich is WAY too heavy (sorry for using the word heavy 100000x in this post...there's really no other word for how I felt haha)." u'It was super salty! It would be good with beer which they do serve at the restaurant. Walked past here on a Saturday decided to get a snack. Got the classic and it was around 10 min wait. They do give you a buzzer which is nice and they gave us cups for water while waiting even tho we opted for take out. The restaurant is nice with a yellow accent colour. They have benches as seating.' u"Oh gosh Melt Shop just makes me melt. \xa0The line usually isn't super long and neither is the wait for your sandwich. \xa0The way it works is you line up (don't get confused between the people waiting for their 'wich and the people actually lining up). \xa0Then order your sandwich -- to be honest they're all probably delish I went with the chicken club just to be safe and it was much more than safe. \xa0I think they also have beer too -- which is great if you can find a seat on the disturbingly yellow picnic benches (unfortunately the color of the place nearly gave me a migraine but I really like the food) which are packed during lunchtime.Then you get a buzzer and you wait. \xa0It's kind of like Shake Shack -- a $10 sandwich quite expensive but quite worth it. \xa0Then it buzzes and you happily take the sandwich back to work hoping that nobody sees you struggling to eat the huge sandwich you didn't expect to be that large. \xa0Or buttery. \xa0Or cheesy. \xa0Or delicious. \xa0Dang. If you like chicken breast aka just a big helping of chicken breast Melt Shop will give you the bang for your buck with the chicken club. \xa0There's a good amount of arugula fresh tomato and grilled practically fried mozzarella cheese in there. \xa0The breast is so crunchy it almost scratches the roof of your mouth when you bite into it and so buttery you're going to need lots of napkins." u'Oreo shake and tater dots were delicious. But I felt like the fried chicken grilled cheese lacked ....cheese! A very filling and satisfying sandwich for sure but I wish there was more cheese/moisture to go with the sourdough.' u'Melt Shop\'s walls list several slogans declaring how tasty the food here is one which states their product is "Instagrammably delicious." People we have reached peak internet in addition to peak hipster.Nothing of course screams hipster trendy as pretending that tater tots are as good as fries or using toast as a hamburger bun. Sorry Napoleon I\'m not quite with you on the former but at least the latter works relatively well due to the quality of the bread used. The patty of the burger has a salty taste making it similar to Wendy\'s which in my book is a positive. I found the amount of cheese to be overwhelming but the place caters to people who really love cheese so I can\'t fault Melt Shop for that.Summary: It\'s Yelpingly pretty good.' u"Pretty good! Very very heavy meal. I had the three cheese sandwich- the cheeses definitely blended together well. It was a bit heavy on the butter side but still very tasty. My sister had the chicken club sandwich I had a bite and it was delicious!!! Kinda wish I would've ordered that instead lol.The tots were run of the mill regular tator tots nothing special about them but still good. And the homemade half & half was pretty good.All in all I will definitely be back to try the other sandwich varieties." u'Have tried few different sandwiches and they are all really good. I have done takeout and have been always surprised that even after sandwich sitting in that takeout box for 20 mins bread is still crispy and it tastes equally good.Not a big fan of their tater tots that they keep trying to sell me every time.It gets busy during lunch so getting a table (open seating) is not guaranteed.' u"I been to this location on two occasions mostly for casual hang outs with friends in the city before a Broadway show or even after work. It has a cute atmosphere and the food comes out on metal trays as if it's a school lunch. It's a really good spot for a quick bite to eat especially if time is on your mind. The sandwiches are all signature to their store in terms of their cheese choices so it's really cool. Overall I like the place and would come back if I was in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to specifically come here."]
112.Gallaghers Steakhouse,[u'Rick the waiter is always good to usHe is professional and helpfulThe steaks and swordfish are nothing short of phenomenal Flavors and presentations are first rateCheesecake is delicious tooThank you Rick and gallaghers!!' u"The meat locker up front does create curiosty from passersby. The restaurant ages the meat 28 days before serving to its customers. A good practice for a steak house from what I heard. Yet this place doesn't believe in taking temperature of the cooking steaks. Tough luck if you're very precise of how well you want the steak to be cooked. Waiters do want you when taking orders however. Many football posters and drawings are displayed on the walls. Well this place does have a 80-yr old history since prohibition years.From Restaurant Week menu I ordered Beefsteak Tomato & Onion for appetizer. My friend got the Wedge Salad and lobster bisque. Waiter brought out 2 big slices and tomato 1 big slice of onion in the middle and salad dressing on the side. It for sure doesn't take a cook to prep this plate. The lobster bisque looks amazing however. Soup was poured into the lobster plate at the table. For entree my friends got Sliced Filet Mignon (Caramelized Peppers & Onions Asparagus Roasted Garlic Jus) and 10 oz. Filet Mignon (Creamed Spinach Mashed Potatoes and $10 Supplement). I got the Short Ribs of Beef Braised with Tomatoes Molasses and Vinegar Mashed Potatoes. Loved the Sliced Filet Mignon which came with a surprise poached egg on top. Delicious by the look itself! 10 oz. Filet Mignon was served medium rare instead of medium as ordered. Again they don't take temp of the steaks~. The steak was tender but not exactly butter-knife-cut-through soft. My Short Ribs rocked. It's tender juice and a bit fatty. Excellent with smashed potato. We finished the fulfilling meal with Raspberry Sorbet for dessert. Yum. Do order steaks here. All 4 stars were for the short ribs and sliced filet mignon." u"Came here on a Friday night with reservations booked through open table. \xa0I'd say it was about 80% full at 6:30pm. \xa0They have a bar in the center of the room as you walk in. There is also a bigger dining area towards the back of the establishment. \xa0There are also high seats by the walls in the bar area which is more dimly lit if you're looking for a more intimate atmosphere.Service at these high end steak houses are all very good and professional. \xa0For a party of four we went for a sirloin (medium) and porterhouse for two (medium rare). \xa0Also a few appetizers which was more than enough.Hamachi appetizer - this raw yellowtail dish was very good small portions but would recommend! 5/5Sirloin - not bad what I expected from a sirloin steak but very dully seasoned. 4/5Porterhouse - we said medium rare but it was more like rare. The meat was very hard to chew. But they did offer to put it back on the fire for us which helped. Similar to the sirloin the steak was very bland. \xa0Their in house made sauce was good and I needed to use it for every piece of steak I had. 3/5Saut\xe9ed spinach and Brussels sprouts were a good compliment to the steaks. 4/5Giving this a 3.5 rounding down since they are a steak house and I wasn't very impressed with theirs." u"Maybe I'm just not a fan of traditional steakhouses in general but I thought Gallegher's was just ok during RW 2016. They were certainly packed so it appears the place is popular. I was in the mood for creamed spinach so I went with the filet mignon for $10 supp. The flavor was fine and the sides were good but it just wasn't a wow. The short rib was tender and flavorful and the steak & eggs was a generous portion and are probably better choices for RW...The cool looking meat locker in front of the restaurant is where we were told they age the steaks for 30 days. It didn't make the flavor of my steak any more impressive but was still cool to see." u'Made reservation for my last night stay in NYC and we were seated right away. Staff and customer service was great. Although the food took awhile to come out since it was busy. Loved everything here!' u"I love this place! Everything was amazing! I had crab cakes spinach mashed potatoes and steak - all of the food was incredible! I can't wait to eat my leftovers tomorrow. The portions were pretty large too. I had Chardonnay - that was good. I was too full for dessert. But I'll definitely be back to try more on the menu! Can't wait till my next visit." u"Old school steak house. Delicious food. Great service. Although not inexpensive Gallagher's is a great option if you want a delicious steak in the city. Is there anything better than a glass of bourbon and great beef? I started with tomato and onion appetizer with blue cheese dressing and steak sauce on the side. If you don't order this with some steak sauce you don't know what you're doing.I usually stick to sirloin but the ribeye was recommended and was fantastic. It was perfectly cooked to my liking and was a nice marbled cut. The sides were delicious as well. I really have no complaints." u'Came here for RW2016. Got a corner booth seat. It was wonderfulStarter:Caesar Salad: Light and refreshing. Nothing too out of the ordinaryBeefsteak Tomatoes and Onion: Thought it was going to be a thin slice beef dish w/ tomato.. however it is just 2 really thick slice of tomatoes. However... it was very refreshing. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe and sweet with balsamic vinaigrette dressing which I choiceEntree:Lamb chops: It comes with creamy spinach and mashed potatoes. Those were amazing. The lamb chops were also perfectly cooked in medium rare. Well worth the $5 supplement10 oz Filet: I sub the side with the asparagus with onion and tomatoes bc I already had the spinach and mashed potatoes from the other dish. The filet is over charred on the outside and very burnt. The steak sauce is very strong and taste like spaghetti sauce.Dessert:Ice cream + Sorbet. The vanilla ice cream was very creamy and sweet. Lemon sorbet was super sour. Raspberry sorbet was great.Like the other reviews I had maybe 3 different servers coming by and disappearing. The dessert took about 15 minutes to come out even though it is just scooping ice cream... the server seemed annoyed that I asked for the dessert after he passed by to pour water and dropped one of the plateOverall one of my fav restaurant week menu/food so far' u'Came here during restaurant week for lunch. Ordered the ceasar salad filet mignon and cheesecake for dessert. The filet mignon came with mashed potatoes and creamy spinach very good!! The cheesecake was to dieee for - secretly enjoyed that more than my meal. Would definitely recommend!' u"Date of service: June 3 2015Meal: Dinner dine inAll Ratings out of 10:Quality of food: 8Food to Spend Value: 7Quality of Service: 8Overall Rating: 8Sometimes the primal carnivore takes a hold of me and there is nothing like a great steak to satiate such an innate instinct. Gallagher's is a very old steak house in Manhattan with a lot of tradition and the reviews looked great so I went there for dinner with a couple of colleagues to see if it could quench my carnivorous urges.You know you are walking into a place that takes pride in their steaks when they gladly display the source of the steaks to you. Gallagher's has a meat locker right up front full of the most beautiful cuts of meat. Seeing this got me more excited about my impending dinner as I could see that the bar for quality was super high. After deliberating over a number of delicious sounding options we decided to start with the Baked Clams Oreganata appetizer. I also decided to get a bowl of the Lobster Bisque. The clams were served baked on the half shell in an Oreganata style meaning they had a oregano breadcrumb topping that gave them a bit of an Italian feel. The clams themselves were tender yet firm and the topping made for a delicious start to the meal. The Bisque was extremely creamy and uber flavorful. Each spoonful was very robust tasting with a very nice blend of seasonings and the lobster in the soup was very tender and delicious culminating in an amazing bowl of soup.Gallagher's is a steak house and my inner carnivore was ready to take hold so I absolutely had to order a steak. I wanted a big steak and they certainly had many to choose from! After a lot of back and forth with myself including asking the waiter many questions I decided to go with the Veal Porterhouse medium rare. We also ordered Brussel Sprouts and Asparagus to share as sides since they were a la carte. The steak was massive and the hickory log grilled taste came out very nicely. The steak was very juicy and full of flavor and it was prepared perfectly medium rare with each bite melting in my mouth. The asparagus was served as jumbo spears (my preferred way of having asparagus) and they were prepared with a nice seasoning and had perfect firmness. The Brussel Sprouts were also quite delicious and the entire meal was completely delightful.I was pretty full already but the dessert menu looked amazing. Normally a key lime pie on any dessert menu would be an automatic for me but the Blueberry Upside Down Cake caught my eye so I went with it instead. Though I cannot comment on the key lime pie I was not disappointed with my choice. The cake itself was delicious the blueberry glaze had a nice sweet flavor and complemented the cake perfectly and the topping of vanilla ice cream made the entire thing completely decadent.The waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful with all the menu questions we had. The atmosphere was really neat as it had an old timey classy feel but with a modern updating. All the food that came out was prepared very well and was delicious. The food was pricey but not as high as similar places I have been to in NYC so though being expensive the overall value was still very good. The entire dining experience was very satisfying from the satiated taste buds to the full stomachs to the enjoyable atmosphere. Gallagher's is definitely more of a special occasion type of place but it comes highly recommended particularly for when you have those deep carnivorous urges." u'Would have been A OK....went for lunch before \xa0a showing of Cinderella.... Decent food for what we ordered. The problem arose when I went to pay for the lunch. The waiter comes back and notes that my card was declined. I actually started laughing because there was no way it should be. I call my bank and they inform me the card has been shut off because for some reason the establishment swiped my card 5 times??? Huh? !?!Never heard of such a thing.I called the server over and informed him to let him know and he denied it.?!?No reason for my bank to lie to me??Anyway. Needless to say I paid the tip in cash and took a picture of the receipt.Had to verify to the bank to have my card turned back on. Very shady.Will never return needless to say.Hint-Check your service staff.' u"Don't get me wrong the food was amazing.But the waiter who was bald and I cannot remember his name provided our table absolutely no service except pouring water and reminded me I should pay him tips when I got the cheque. Maybe because I am young and Asian he assumed I will not pay tip and thus provided no service at all. I also find his request offending given he knew it very well that he provided no service (not once did he ask how was the food and whether we need anything) but still asked me for tip. He did got the tip given it was near midnight. But this experience was very disappointing." u'Great service atmosphere & food! Such a fun place to go! The steak is wonderful & perfectly cooked along with the corn & mashed potatoes. The service is superb. I will be back for sure.' u'The best ribeye of my life - and I am an expert. \xa0Ate here alone and felt well cared for by the experienced waiters and staff. \xa0My waiter had worked there 21 years. \xa0I will be back!' u"The meat in the window made me run in here thinking everything must taste like butter... but maybe my taste buds are ridiculously spoiled but I was ever so slightly disappointed. We ordered: veal porterhouse filet mignon 14 oz. 1/2 dozen oysters side of mushrooms side of Mac and cheese glass of Cab and a glass of draft beer (dinner for two... we had left overs since we ordered way too much).The half dozen oysters are 3 west coast and 3 east coast. I normally prefer west coast but the ones served here we're ridiculously tiny... tiny as in nearly invisible to the eye and wondered if the oyster fell off during it's trip to our table. Filet mignon was a bit dry. It wasn't my order but when I tasted it although cooked medium and not medium rare it was a bit dry. The veal porterhouse was cooked properly as medium rare but there was no taste. I thought it mentioned their meats were cooked over firewood but I tasted no other flavors and it tasted a bit bland. The most surprising was the steaks were served on cold plates. I thought the norm was for steaks to be served on warm plates... but then I could be wrong. I have had some incredible steaks in Chicago and Los Angeles and perhaps my expectation was too high. After reading more reviews wished I ordered the bone in sirloin or at least the porterhouse instead." u'The most awesome experience and delicious food I ever had. Service is impeccable and top shelf. John our waiter is the BEST and made my family and myself feel like VIPs....' u'As soon as you walk in the meat locker catches your eye. You know they take there meat seriously.There french onion soup is some of the best I ever had.The steak tartar was flavorful.They had a special green bean bacon and shrimp salad it had a huge amount of shrimp tossed with a tangy dressing.The rib eye was tender and full flavor the only problem was it was too big and I could not take home the leftovers.There homemade steak sauce was great.The hash browns and potato chips were both worth the price of admission.The service was top notch.If you are a steak lover this is the place for you.' u'First visit to NY. We passed this place up after Jersey Bots and noticed those huge steaks and decided on this place for dinner. So happy we did. Delicious filet mignon & salmon. Our waitress was quite funny & very nice.' u"As I travel to NYC on a regular basis I have walked by Gallaghers hundreds of times but have never gone in. \xa0After one visit I am hooked. \xa0I had the best lamb chops I have ever had anywhere! \xa0My picky friend had the shrimp scampi and she raved that it was one of the best she has ever had. \xa0We ordered sweet mashed potatoes saut\xe9ed mushrooms key lime pie several rounds of drinks and a fabulous glass of Markus Molitor wine and the bill was less than $200. \xa0Considering the caliber of the meal and old school service by Nick our waiter I think we got quite a deal! \xa0The only problem is that we couldn't finish all the food as the portions were very generous. \xa0First class all around!" u"Took bae here for his bday and Gallagher's made it extra exceptional!!!Not only was the steak amazing but so was the service. \xa0We reserved a prime rib and ordered the filet mignon Au poivre for our entrees. \xa0We ordered creamed spinach mashed potatoes and asparagus as sides. \xa0Everything was SO good! \xa0Our steaks were both medium rare like we asked. \xa0The filet mignon was super charred on the outside but it was still amazingly tender on the inside - if you don't want it as charred I'm sure they will cook it to your liking. \xa0For my bfs birthday they sang happy birthday and gave him a complimentary cake and both of us complimentary dessert wine! \xa0They also sent a fruit platter because the table next to us spilled wine on the ground and got on our bags - the damage was minor but our waiter made sure to make up for it. \xa0So rare to find a restaurant that actually cares nowadays - even for a steakhouse. \xa0I will prob never go to another steakhouse in NYC again.Steak wise - this place is better than WG quality meats and strip house! \xa0Even their bread basket was good."]
123.Southern Hospitality,[u"So apparently Justin Timberlake is part owner of this fine establishment :). That alone is enough to get me in the door. Unfortunately today neither him or any of the other N'SYNC band members were in today I guess they're too busy with their revival tour LOL.Still the food is more than enough reason to also come in here. Southern Hospitality true to its name serves up southern styled American food like fried chicken (A MUST HAVE) burgers and fries. They also have a fully stocked bar and offer a Happy Hour.I walked in on a sweltering hot night. Seriously this heat wave we've been having is merciless!! The hostess kindly guided me to my seat right away and my waitress was very kind and attentive. I just had to have their famous Tennessee Fried Chicken. They fry the skin super crispy here literally it is soooo good that I could just eat all the crispy skins and toss out the meat LOL! Of course I didn't do that and even the meat itself was nicely marinated.I also ordered their Crispy Fries and requested to have melted cheese added to it. Please note that they don't offer cheese fries straight up on the menu itself if you want cheese added like I did it will be charged a $1 extra.And for dessert I created my own improvised sundae. Now once again they don't actually offer sundaes on their dessert menu however my waitress kindly allowed me to create my own. I ordered two scoops of vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with whipped cream. Soooooooo good!!" u'Just finishing brunch now here. Although I was disappointed they ran out of champagne for mimosas they did substitute sangria First off the food was amazing! The cheesy grits was so good I got an order to go! The Mac and cheese was perfect creamy and cheesy and chicken and waffles were perfect.The sangria was great! Especially for unlimited .Best of all was \xa0the service . Our server Mikayla was awesome! Such a bubbly girl with nothing but smiles ! She made sure our unlimited sangrias were filled and just walked around with a smile the whole time with being attentive. Def ask for her as a server because she is so sweet. My friend and I are servers and were super picky but she was amazing ! The band is also awesome. Overall an awesome time !!!' u"My friends and I ordered the fried pickles St Louis ribs brisket fried chicken and a pulled pork sandwich. The fried pickles were the only decent thing we ate. The St Louis ribs were okay but I've had better. The brisket was too dry and not fatty enough and was not the melt-in-your-mouth type of brisket. I was disappointed. \xa0The fried chicken was okay but I felt the meat wasn't moist. The pulled pork was on the dryer side." u"Came here for brunch on a date. The place was fine and the service was amazing - thanks Denise! - but the food was meh. It was perhaps just the meal that I got - can't even remember because it was so bland {something like eggs bacon and collared greens}. Nothing special and no frills but good for gay people which is the predominant residents of Hell's Kitchen." u"Just a solid 3 stars I wasn't all that amazed. But that sweet tea drink is amazing 3 of them had me on my ass. We made a reseration at 7:30pm which we were seated at 7:45pm. For a Friday night the place seemed to clear out by 8:30/9pm. I didn't even know this was JT's restaurant to be honest until I got there.We ordered the nachos because of the awesome reviews that they got they were just ok. My BF ordered the mac and cheese which again just OK. The 10 hour pulled pork was just OK too. I don't know I was expecting a lot more for some reason. I've had better at John Brown Smoke house in LIC. The beans were amazing and that was the only thing that was better than OK.:::BATHROOM ALERT:::I wish I would have seen the bathroom before I ordered. It was disgusting and a disgrace. I don't think JT would even attempt to use this place either.I'm not sure why I just gave give them anything more than an OK. The price is really whoa! Like save your money trust me. There is cheaper and way better BBQ spots out there. We did like the customer service everyone was nice. I guess I just expected more from a celebrity owner." u"I was wandering through midtown Manhattan and stumbled upon southern hospitality. Let me tell you this place is to die for. If you're looking for good food and a good time this is the place to be. Be sure to request the waitress named Jenny." u"I came here for a friend's birthday brunch. \xa0Albeit a punch to the wallet I left with fond memories of our experience.We had reservations for 11 AM which I strongly recommend. \xa0We had the place to ourselves for about an hour but by noon it was PACKED! \xa0Allegedly there was to be a live band at 12:30 but they didn't start setting up until after we left around 1. \xa0Honestly I wasn't too bummed - conversation was a comfortable noise level this way.We all ordered the bottomless brunch which does not include the entree but I believe is only $15 for two hours unlimited. \xa0Not bad as compared to other brunches around Midtown! \xa0You can choose from the bellini mimosa screwdriver or bloody mary. \xa0My friend strongly recommends the bloody mary - it's nice and spicy!Entrees ordered: eggs benedict crab cakes and the vanilla french toast.Eggs Benedict - portions so big my friend couldn't finish.Vanilla French Toast - winner.Crab cakes - Nothing to write home about but also not terrible. I ordered a side of cheesy grits & they do not resemble grits at all. \xa0In fact it looks like just a block of cheese. \xa0But I'm a bigger fan of cheese than grits so I'll oblige!I wish I remembered the waitress's name because she was awesome. \xa0She was the type who understands the value of making sure bottomless mimosas are filled to the brim every single time. \xa0When our time was coming to a close she even brought the birthday boy TWO Bloody Mary's. \xa0Seriously I wish I knew her name!I will definitely keep this place in mind as a potential brunch spot in the future. \xa0Okay Justin Timberlake I'll marry you already." u"Overall everything was just OK. The waitress the food the service. Nothing really stand for hospitality for the $100 dinner for two. I heard they recently changed the menu. I ordered a $34 entree the food isn't bad but the portion and the quality aren't worth the money. I guess Southern Hospitality has less of a hospitality as days goes by." u"I'm definitely a fan I had a really great meal here. I went at a not so busy time so we had the place to ourselves the food was hot and delish and I would Def go again." u'Go ahead and close your doors. Clearly the price of rent and ingredients is too much for you to handle. Cutting the quality of food is not going to help in the long run. I\'ve been eating here since I moved to Hell\'s Kitchen in 2011. Last August was the last time anything was right. First the menu changed. "Oh we think A La Carte would allow for a better selection process."Okay fine. It was still delicious but the reality was that the prices increased. YOU\'RE NOT FINE DINING. You don\'t get to have "A La Carte". Then we began to notice the cast iron pans were absent the plates were emptier the atmosphere was more aggressive. Now just today this broke us up - rubbery chicken skin pork cubes instead of pulled pork tough baby back ribs and a crap shoot hefty bill at the end. All-in-all we paid $70 for a shit meal. Pulled pork sandwich (my classic order every time)- cubes of pork that needed a good solid 2 hours more at least. SUCH a disappointment. Pulled pork is NOT CUBES. It\'s not. I swear. Rubbery chicken that had a chlorine flavor - yeah we know running a restaurant is expensive in NYC. But if you can\'t buy and prepare quality chicken LEAVE IT OFF THE MENU. The baby back ribs weren\'t cooked nearly long enough. They didn\'t fall off the bone. Having to struggle with ribs at a BBQ place is hilariously sad.The fries were freaking delicious. If you just became a fry place you\'d be great.The water was super. There. You got two things right for $70. Congrats.' u"2 1/2There are many better options if your willing to do the research and get on the subway. I was hungry lazy and happened to be in Time Square craving bbq so I decided to \xa0try this place. For the most part it was what you would expect for the location. Over priced and over fried when it came to my wings and fried pickles. The tater tots were good at least but I'd skip it." u"First time visiting SH with a few friends & my bf for brunch. There aren't many places that still have unlimited mimosas but this place still honors the timed tradition and extremely well. While waiting for our party the bf & I decided to grab a mimosa which turned into 3 since they were so well prepared.Once our party arrived we kept the love going with a few more mimosas. I ordered the Chicken & Waffles which were delicious but the chicken was a bit over fried on a few pieces but satisfying.The service here was also good. From the time I walked in the hostess was very helpful. She found us a seat at the bar until our party arrived. Once we were sat the great service continued.If you're in the Hells Kitchen area looking for a brunch spot consider SH. FYI they also have a live band that performs for a few hours. FYI If you're looking to make a reservation I was told they don't accept them the day of which doesn't make sense. Plan ahead but we walked right in after a snow storm." u"Delicious!!!!!!!!!! So amazing. Everything was perfect. We came for brunch. And it was absolutely the best thing I've ever had in NY. The biscuits was very tasty. And the butter was heavily. So so good. Also got an order of fried pickels so yummy. Everything on the menu was amazing. I will recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be back myself. Trust me it's the best comfort food you will ever have." u"This place was ok. The venue is cute and spacious. Very southern feel ... The food was a bit salty for my liking however they did have a huge selection of comfort foods and all of them looked appetizing. The butter was delicious and so were the biscuits. (We were there for brunch) I wasn't a fan of the restrooms they were TINY. Also the majority of their dishes pictured on Yelp and their electric blue lemonade are no longer available/served. Boo" u"Got out early from work. Desperate to grab a drink! Went over to Hell's Kitchen and bumped into this place. I love BBQ and decided to give this place a try.Just after I sat down and went over to the bar and grab a drink a girl was giving out free miller lights because it was the first night of football season! Made my day. All my friends got one and I ended up didn't have to pay for drinks because some of my friends don't drink lol made my day!However things were pretty expensive! No happy hour no specials. The waitresses weren't too nice either ignored us multiple times. Not very southern hospitality. I ordered ribs with string beans and mac & cheese for the side one of my friend ordered the chicken waffle. The food was southern though and huge!!!Overall the food was great atmosphere was southern just the people and price weren't the best deal. You're in Hell's Kitchen step your game up!!" u'Disappointing comes to mind with this "southern (not really) hospitality) joint. I ordered a mojito to start which is easy to make. I ordered the pulled park sandwich.I expected pulled pork that you would find in the south (special rub on the pork hours of roasting time mouth watering) but this was a sad disappointment. I have been to the south this pork has not. It was tasteless pork no special anything about it to make it "southern" just roasted pork (possible salt and black pepper to the rub giving it more credit then it deserves with these ingredients) thrown on a hamburger bun...umm did I order a sloppy joe?? birthday dinner fail!! Stay away (TOURIST TRAP) as it had a celebrity backing...and how could you be so lazy that I had to add my BBQ sauce to the sandwich ( cold table side) tater tots is the only reason I give 2 stars because it\'s not easy to find even in NYC. Sad & disappointing best describes this birthday dinner.' u"Yikes. \xa0J.T. your restaurant 'N Stinks- I feel bad saying that since I loved your pop group. \xa0At least you have live bluegrass music at Southern Hospitality available during Saturday & Sunday brunch hours; neat feature even though most folks ignored them[insert sad face]. \xa0I was here for a fellow Yelper's farewell brunch[insert 2nd sad face]. The chicken and waffles were sub-par. \xa0Visually my plate looked like it had potential with the crispiness of the chicken. \xa0The breading on the chicken needed more seasoning. \xa0There was a choice of one breast or leg & a thigh. \xa0I asked for a leg and a thigh and I received a leg and a breast. \xa0Oh don't get me started on white dry meat[insert displeased emoticon]. The waffles I received were mushy semi-warm and tasted like it was from the frozen section of a supermarket. \xa0The only good thing was that I felt stuffed by this appropriately sized plate. \xa0Also the service was outstanding(besides the mix-up on my order) and a few within the group opted for the unlimited drinks special- our waitress was on it[insert the too-wide smile emoticon]!Hell's Kitchen has never been my go-to 'hood for food; Southern Hospitality doesn't help the case for trekking there. It's a fun joint with so much unfulfilled potential namely because of the food.[insert frustration]" u"Five stars for brunch!! First off it's bottomless and they live up to that my glass was never empty. Great place to come for Saturday/Sunday brunch. I had the popcorn chicken special which came with cornbread waffles. Wow it was incredible. Nothing like fried chicken for breakfast! Great atmosphere with a live bluegrass band which was nice. The service was great our waitress was super friendly and definitely did a good job keeping our glasses filled." u"Five stars because they really put the hospitality in southern hospitality. The manager made sure to go around and introduce himself and our waitress was never not on top of our table...in a good way of course :)!The ambiance definitely reminds me of BB Kings! For those who aren't familiar with Memphis that is quite a staple on Beale Street. We lucked out and got to try a few things. Appetizer wise the fried pickles and mac n cheese tots definitely take the cake. If you're sharing with a bigger party I suggest fried pickles. The cheese tots are gigantic but there's only about 5 of them. Now for those Entrees. I just got the not so simple salad and man it was delicious. I went with pulled pork because I'm from Memphis and I was raised on that stuff. The dressing was great and the salad had quite a good ratio of everything! At this point I was happily stuffed and then they brought us our dessert. So yikes. The dessert you guys dayummm. I made room for that real quick. The banana pudding hands down stole my heart. (And yes I just sang that Gwen Stefani song in order to spell it correctly.) We also had the pleasure of trying the pecan pie as well! That was good but like I said the banana pudding was ridiculously good. As for location I highly suggest eating here before a Broadway show. It was tops a 5 minute walk! Loved it!Way to make us Memphians proud Justin!" u'Rude service!! Hurried annoyed and uninformed. We tried to inquire about special diets/ allergies and were brushed aside.What a disappointment.']
53.Chirping Chicken,[u"I'm so so happy that this new location of Chirping Chicken is here!!!!!I have taken cabs and many trains from wherever I happen to be just to get to their 77 Th street location but now this location is centrally located with the same excellent \xa0recipe  some of the same people from uptown and of course the service and customer care that nowadays is very hard to find. I love that this is close to the 2 huge 42 street movie theaters and my #7 train too as well as tons of other trains. Great Convenient  excellent food and ambiance too!!Nicholas the manager is so personable when I came in today to see for sure if it's just like my favorite 77 Th street location he greeted me right away and remembered me from all the times at the other place nice I like that!Also the cashier was very nice  no attitude just enthusiastic and warm. This has been a difficult day but when I walked in I felt like I was coming home to a really caring family they make you feel happy for showing up  they make you want to come back over and over again!!! I hope this new location is slamming with business always just like the uptown one. No place deserves more good than these people!" u"Update! They put the 1/4 chicken 1 side with pita bread back on the lunch menu! It's only $8. Try it with a side for rice & beans. They have drinks for $1.75 too. Snapple soda and water. That's means lunch for just $10 and change. They change the lunch special menu to a horrible burrito bowl that now costs more. I am very disappointed. \xa0I will not be back for lunch anymore. Why change it to something no one wants or expects you to have? Please change your name to Chirpin Burrito." u"the cluck u equivalent to new york city chirpings have been popping up around the city. ordered a shitload of food the other night from there - ribs spicy wings fries potato salad salad and some coleslaw. this is a very aggressive choice of food; get ready to take a nap afterwards or not really move around much. whew. i bought too much. went a little crazy there. the leftovers are decent as well overall i won't be ordering from this place again." u"This place is a true find! I'm not sure how the other locations are but this one is really great. Fresh tasting food at great prices. They offer something for everyone from healthy grilled food to chicken fingers from Vegetarian and Gluten free. Tonight I had grilled tilapia over a Greek salad with stuffed grape leaves and the largest sweet potato. \xa0The dressing on the salad was so good. We had grilled chicken wings. \xa0Others in my group had 1/2 grilled whole chicken fried wings grilled shrimp and roasted vegetables with salad. \xa0The grilled shrimp are large and delicious. \xa0Everything was perfectly cooked. \xa0This place isn't fancy but it's clean and a great value for a good meal. You go up and place your order and then they bring to your table. Perfect place for the family as they truly have something for every type of appetite and it won't break the bank. The owner is always there and he is incredibly nice. The staff is friendly and helpful. They have specials at amazing prices for the before 5 diners." u'I had the 1/4 chicken meal and it was Sooooo yummmyyyy i will def be calling for delivery!!! Way better than BBQs' u"I literally eat here everyday for lunch. The food is top-notch and the staff is super friendly. My favs are the souvlaki platter (with extra tzatziki sauce) and the grilled chicken. Can't go wrong here." u"Yum!I love Chirping Chicken and am so happy to have them in Hell's Kitchen so close to my office!This is a great place for lunch - only $7.50 for several options including a Grilled Chicken Breast with Side of your choice (always a Baked Potato for me) Arroz con Pollo Chicken Fingers with Fries or Wings (to die for). Friendly and fast service make this place a great addition to the neighborhood. *Lunch specials are for dine-in or take out only. Not delivery." u'This restaurant has the best service that I have ever seen! Everyone is so kind and at the same time professional making you feel good in the place. The food is very good but it came with a little delay so the manager brought for me and my friends some fries and mozzarella sticks on the house. I recommend strongly this place!' u'Cheap and delicious I have never been treated so well in a restaurant! We were a party of six and the food got a 10min delay - the maneger brought us mozzarella sticks french fries and watter bottles on \xa0the house! Also the staff is very polite and friendly' u'We were in New York for a few days for vacation and wanted a quick meal. We were staying in Midtown and yelped places nearby. \xa0Chirping Chicken had good reviews so we decided to give it a try. \xa0We were not disappointed.Our group of 8 came in (4 adults 4 kids) and there was ample seating which was hard to find in NYC. \xa0We ordered the family 1/2 chicken meal for my family. \xa0It was plenty of food for the 4 of us. It came with a small salad chicken a side (we picked mac n cheese) and pita bread. \xa0We ordered an extra mac n cheese for the kids. It was the perfect amount of food for us.While we were waiting for our food the manager or owner brought our table mozzarella sticks. We informed him we did not order these he said no for the kids while they wait. Let me tell you the kids devoured the mozzarella sticks. Once we got our food everything was amazing. My son is a picky eater and said he loved everything which was one of the only times I heard this on our 2 week trip. \xa0The staff were all friendly personable and accommodating. I wish we had one of these back home. Next time I am in Midtown I will for sure give my business to them. Thanks again for everything.' u'This place is really tasty. \xa0The charbroiled chicken was incredible. \xa0My daughter said her "arroz con pollo" was the best food ever. \xa0They were great with our allergy issues too. \xa0Thank you Yelp once again.' u'I have been to this restaurant many times since they have open and have brought friends to experience the amazing food they serve. I have had chicken (quarters grilled tenders and wings) ribs and fish. \xa0 One better than the next. \xa0Salads freshly done every day. \xa0 The sweat potato is wrapped in foil and is very large and like a desert. \xa0 The staff goes out of their way to help you. \xa0Prices are very reasonable if not really cheap. \xa0Check out this great restaurant and you not be disappointed.' u"Good food and terrific service! Have never left a review before but felt compelled to do so after they have consistently impressed me with their professionalism and helpfulness (beyond what I've experienced at any other fast casual restaurant) - and not to mention great chicken." u"I've never been to Chirping Chicken before but after a recent move to Hell's Kitchen I decided to stop by and try out their food. I could not be more pleased by the food and the service. I have been going back to this place at least four times a week because I can't get enough. Great location. Delicious food. Super friendly staff." u"Staff so friendly you'll forget you are in New York. Really tasty chicken and good sides. You won't be disappointed." u"The delivery is really prompt but the whole chicken is somewhat disappointing the crime here being under-seasoning without any good sauce to pick up the slack making this taste like your average gas grilled cookout fare. Lacing this with pepper and some salt definitely helps. The chicken quality is just OK. \xa0Given this it's not especially cheap by any means (whole chicken as of now is $16 + tax and $2.50 delivery fee and tip if you're going that route). \xa0That said it was fresh and not dried out. \xa0Pita was good could see the sandwiches being a better play. \xa0. I'm not one to name names in a review but there is another place in midtown for rotisserie chicken that is the _clear winner_ when you need to score some chicken in midtown." u'Went to Chirping Chicken on 9th for the first time ever with family the other night. After a long day of walking around the city we were hungry and tired. The manager and employees were so warm and welcoming. We ordered appetizers wings chicken shrimp...wow the portions were generous and the food was so fresh and tasty. The place was clean well lit had a constant stream of customers but even then the manager came over to our table and checked on us asking how the food was. I definitely recommend this place for a relatively inexpensive tasty meal with great healthy options (in addition to the fried stuff we love like wings and mozzarella sticks!).' u'Just ordered food from here ordered a turkey burger and fries. The turkey burger was pretty good and the fries were delicious. I honestly have had better turkey burgers but it was pretty good the delivery was pretty fast and the person on the phone was friendly. Most importantly everything was correct on the order.' u'What makes the chicken good is the crispy charred skin. Ordered the orzo salad and really enjoyed how simple and tasty it was.' u'It was the first time I had been here since this space has metamorphisized into many different restaurants. I ordered a quarter rack of ribs which came with pita slices and steamed vegetables. I was given a disc that was going to pulse when my order was ready. I went to take a seat and the disc pulsed. I went to get my food and was told the disc would pulsate when my food was ready-I told them it had-they seemed to be having difficulty with this new system at that time. My food was finally ready and was delicious. The ribs were gone in no time and the steamed vegetables with butter were great. Suprisingly because I had waited for my food for a while and the mix up with the disc pulsating-the manager brought me another quarter rack of ribs and more pita-enough for another meal. I took it as take out since I had an appointment and could not finish them then but had them for lunch the next day. It was a very nice gesture and much appreciated. I would recommend highly and return since the food was so good.']
79.Chimichurri Grill,[u'Chimichurri Grill is a hidden gem sandwiched between a range of restaurants on the block. The restaurant is cozy with only a few tables along a narrow corridor. The staff was friendly and attentive and provided excellent recommendations. The food was delicious! We ordered a special which consisted of steak chorizo blood sausage ribs and vegetables for two and we also ordered a side of ceviche. While a little pricey the food was well-worth it. The portions were just right and the quality of the food (a lot of whole 30 friendly natural homemade dishes) was excellent! We have recommended Chimichurri to our friends and will certainly visit on our next trip!' u'The food here is good although a bit on the pricey side.The service seemed incredibly slow. \xa0we came here with our baby and hoped to be in and out quickly since the restaurant was pretty much empty but it took what it seemed like forever. \xa0 Our baby started getting fussy so we asked to take our food to go. We ordered the filet mignon medium and it came out more rare. The inside was very red. The way i like it but not the way the wife does.' u'Ah another 9th avenue restaurant that does not disappoint. A nice little fine dining enclave to diversify a street filled with casual Thai/American eateries. Chimichurri grill serves up delicious Argentinian food for the international palate!Everything we ordered here was great but be aware it is quite pricey. On top of that the portions are also small so be prepared to share several appetizers tapas style. I remember it being quite cold inside so bring a jacket!' u"I had eaten her before many years ago when it was located on the other side of the street-I got a table in the back [it was a holiday weekend so they were not that crowded] I was seated quickly and got a glass of the Boomtown Merlot. I then ordered the churrasco-a filet mignon pounded flat and cooked just right. This came with a small salad of field greens with a balsamic reduction. The meat was extremely tasty and the waitstaff was extremely attentive. I would recommend and return especially if you lean more towards being a carnivore. I don't recall if there were options for vegetarians." u"I actually had higher expectations for this restaurant. Funny story. After a night of walking around Times Square my date and I wandered into a restaurant across the street of Chimichurri Grill. Having being misled - as their menu outside is completely different than inside we finished our appetizer and Yelped this restaurant and decided to try it.The steaks looked really great! As we arrived the restaurant was empty. The staff did a coat check for us. So far so good. We went ahead and ordered a huge ribeye and charboiled oysters. The oysters were delicious. Comparable to New Orleans for sure. The steak however was mediocre. I wouldn't come back. It was juicy but it didn't hit the spot as I thought it would. After a few bites it wasn't quite as tasty anymore. I wouldn't come back to this restaurant. There are much better options in NYC." u'Came here this afternoon for lunch. \xa0We ordered the Bife Con Fritas (NY Strip Steak w/Fries) Beef Empanda and the Robalo (Branzino fish w/salad). \xa0The steak was a nice size and seasoned nicely. \xa0The menu says 6oz but it seemed more like 8oz-9oz. \xa0The fish was fresh and quality. \xa0The salad was a great compliment as well. \xa0The chimichurri sauce (original and spicy) were two of the best I have had! For dessert we had what I believe they called a Dulce de leche pancake which was different and tasted great. \xa0It was served with leche cream whipped cream and raspberry sauce. The prices are on the higher end but as the old saying goes you get what you pay for and you get quality here. \xa0-Not good for large groups or kids. \xa0The atmosphere is classy quiet calm and intimate.' u'I\'d just arrived on a cold night to NYC and based on the reviews decided this would be a good choice for dinner. I started with the empanadas - beef and chicken - and they were really really good. Maybe the best I\'ve ever had.For my entree I went with the Bife De Chorizo; their version of a NY Strip and a side of their Papas Fritas (French Fries). I liked the steak I wish I could I say I loved it but it was more "like" than love but the fries were great.Service and ambiance were also really good. I\'m a fan and will be back but might try a different cut.' u'During my trip to NY with my husband we wanted to sit down and eat a late dinner after seeing a play. Granted we walked into Chimichurri Grill 30 minutes before closing time we felt so rushed and the food was underwhelming. When we walked in the hostess the first thing the hostess said was "The kitchen is about to close." He hurriedly sat us down and waited there as we tried to figure out what we wanted to eat. I ordered the six clams and my husband ordered Hanger Steak with Mashed Potatoes. My clams were good and my husband said that his steak was good but the mashed potatoes tasted like "box mashed potatoes." While we were dining our waiter was inattentive. He did not come and ask how we were doing how was the food or anything. Customer service was nonexistent. For me I think regardless of when a customer enters your establishment whether it\'s as soon as the door opens or 30 minutes before closing customer service and enthusiasm should always be paramount. Needles to say I wouldn\'t dine here again.' u"I met two friends here after they finished up a broadway show. Nice little restaurant. For starters we ordered the chicken and beef empanadas and the grilled octopus. \xa0The empanadas were crispy and had plenty of fulling plus they were served with the house chimichurri sauces (a like green one and one more olive colored - both delicious). The octopus was nicely cooked but a little light on flavor...so on the chimichurri sauces went. Delicious yet again.For mains both myself and one friend got the churrasco filet which is pounded thin and dressed with...chimichurri sauce! and served with a simple salad with a balsamic glaze. Very tasty very happy with my choice. \xa0My other friend ordered the pork chop and I had a taste and it was really really good too...especially the dipping sauce it came with.It was kind of a late start to the dinner so we opted to skip dessert but they did look good. Overall service was attentive and I'd definitely recommend going back next time in the Hell's Kitchen/Broadway/Times Square area." u"My wife and I looked for a place with grass fed meat and found this spot. Let's just say we will definitely be back. The food was incredibly tasty...not over the top with extra ingredients. The lamb filet mignon kale side were delicious. The service was super friendly and fast. Overall an intimate cozy place to enjoy a casual or fancy dinner with a group of friends or your special someone." u"Churrasco Steak was tender and very well seasoned don't bother telling them how you want it. It's pounded to a patty so it will be tender regardless. Chimichurri sauce was icing on the cake. The coffee cocktail was more desert like." u'For the prices I expected much more. The skirt steak was flavorful and the chimichurri was above average but the fact that you have to pay for sides ($14 for asparagus) was too much. For the same money in Miami I ate better empanadas a dry aged ribeye cooked by Francis Mallman (it was mind blowing) and he came to my table to ask how the meal was.' u'Highly recommend this place. The steaks were great the carpaccio was amazing and the staff was very professional. We had a table of 6 and were comfortable in the small restaurant.Pay attention on the way because you will walk right by it.' u"This place has got great meat! If you're looking for top quality grass fed beef with delicious sides then this is the place to visit. It's also a nice and small restaurant perfect for an intimate dinner. Highly recommended!" u'The place was smaller than I expected but it was packed with customers which was a good sign we got the last table for 2 at this restaurant the service was very fast and efficient. We got the 3 sausage platter which came with a chorizo pork sausage and blood sausage they were delicious! Specially with the Chimichurri and smokey spicy sauce. We also got the shrimp ceviche for appetizer which was very nice.For main I got a 10oz steak with mushroom and chimichurri sauce meat and mushrooms were was cooked to perfection and very tasty with the sauce' u'I am a big lover of Argentine and Brazilian food. I had a go to spot in Midtown named "Sosa Borella" but this past fall the place closed somewhat abruptly at least in my mind.I was looking for another go to spot and decided to give Chimichurri Grill a try for lunch. I was in a bit of a rush as I had a meeting at the UN I was heading to but as I sat down to eat the waiter told me - "I hope you are not in a rush". At that moment I knew I would be late.I started with an ice cold Quilmes- one of my favorite beers A refreshing pale lager Quilmes is basically the national beer of Argentina and it can be found in NYC most often at Whole Foods.This was followed by a house salad with a homemade vinaigrette dressing. The salad was excellent. The greens were fresh and the dressing was mixed in to the correct measure. There was a good mix of dressing to the taste of the greens and the salad was not "swimming" in the oil.The lunch sized portion of the famous Argentine "Lomo" with frites arrived next on a wooden plank. The steak was a generous portion of tender grass fed beef and it was a perfect medium ( pink center). To be honest I have never ever had a problem with steaks at Argentine grill restaurants. The cook staff while not always Argentine have excellent skill on the grill. The frites were also cut from potatoes and not some frozen refried mess. They were fried in a light oil and had a nice coating of garlic and oregano.The food was filling and overall the meal was great.I was the only customer in the place so I basically had the restaurant to myself. The waiter Ruben is the NYC director of the River Plate Fan Club so we had a great time talking soccer and Argentina. My next visit will be most likely for my birthday in March this time for dinner. If that visit goes as well as this time I know I have scored a goal.' u"Best steak I've had in the states and best since being in Uruguay. It was high priced but worth it. I don't think the workers were from Argentina though... Which is normal I guess..." u'I was here for lunch with a client and almost spent about 2 hours here waiting for food. Most places around the area where I have gone during lunch hour have had reasonable service but this place was just very very slow even though there was only one other table besides us. The food was good and the waiter was nice and attentive. The Empanadas were satisfying & the fish of the day Grilled Branzino was soft delicate and very juicy. All the non-vegetarian items on the menu are grass-fed and free-range.The only lunch menu they had was a pre-fix menu for $28 with an option to pick an appetizer and a main course.Recommendation: Grilled Branzino' u'The entire meal and experience was amazing (all on a whim) while visiting New York City (native New Yorker; moved away and this restaurant reminds me why I must move back!! The stand out feature was the chorizo trio. I could eat that morning noon and night without a hint of guilt! The blood sausage especially amazing. If an upstairs apartment opens up; Please let me know!!I highly recommend NOT passing on the deserts. This is an especially delightful repute on lazy Sundays.' u'Meeeeh... We tried an Argentine restaurant in Barcelona Spain that was to die for and we were hoping for the same experience here. We were the second table to arrive ambiance was nice great music. The waiter and host/bartender(?) were nice as well nothing to complain about on their part.We only ordered entr\xe9es didn\'t feel like starters... Our order took a while maybe 30 mins to come out. While we waited they gave us each a roll of bread with some olive oil. Nothing special there. We sipped on our wine while we waited which I loved.I ordered the filet mignon w/ blue vein cheese sauce and a side of the creamed Swiss chard. I asked for medium and received medium well which didn\'t destroy my meal but meeeh. The Swiss chard was pretty good love the creaminess. He ordered the 10 oz rib eye with rosemary roasted potatoes he says they were "okay." We also tried the chimichurri sauce that they bring out and I feel like there was something missing. Our night came out to about $150 for two entrees and a bottle of wine. Don\'t really think it was worth it. I\'m considering giving them another chance... We\'ll see...']
144.Birdland Jazz Club NYC,[u"Want to have the time of your life watching a big band?No it's not a trick question. The Friday evening house band The Birdland Big Band is the real deal. The music they play is exciting and fairly audience-friendly but it's still legitimate enough jazz to satisfy the jazz connoisseur. The energy these cats play with can be felt not just heard. Some say it's like watching a rock band disguised as a jazz band!The atmosphere is classy and there's not a bad seat in the house; you can see from anywhere in the place. The staff is efficient and super friendly. This isn't one of those jazz clubs that make you feel like a nuisance for showing up. You'll be greeted with a smile and they take good care of you once you're inside.The food's delicious and the bartenders really know what they're doing. They'll have a list of drinks specifically to satisfy the $10 minimum so you can be sure you'll get your money's worth. They're real professionals too there's nothing they can't make!The band starts at 5:15. That's on purpose I found out they're not just starting late. It's actually a good place to hang and have dinner if you're seeing the headlining artist later in the evening and it's close enough to the Broadway theaters that it's a terrific pre-show dinner.Check out this club and this band Friday you'll leave wanting more!" u'I will never go to Birdland again. \xa0I saw the fantastic place amazing artists BUT \xa0the worst attitude you did to me.Tonight July 27th 2016 There was a bothering music played from somewhere while the live band was playing. So the manager kept looking where that sound \xa0from. When she came to us the second time she just took my bag away without saying anything. I ran to her and mentioned "there\'s no technology item in the bag and you are not allow to touch my bag." But she still kept walking to outside and checking my bag. I was aggressive to argue with her then she didn\'t let me finish my talking and just walked away. So I shouted " what\'s your problem?" And here came the bartender. He shxt the long sentence with dirty words \xa0to me. After 5 minutes they figured out that sound was came from another table......I just couldn\'t believe this happen to me in New York. 1. To the manager you can\'t take anything from me without my permit. You are a STEALER!! \xa0And you know what? the worst thing is you never let me finish my speaking even when you are apologizing.2. To \xa0the Bartender you shxt those words to me and let the waitress apologize to me? what a nice attitude! I actually give the tips to the waitress who replace you to apologize.I didn\'t accept any treatment from you after that. I am not going to forgive you forever \xa0because your speaking insulted me and my family so much. Hopefully this is not going to happen to other foreigners.3.What a famous place and such a service to customers!' u"I've been here a couple times. Most recent visit was this past weekend. We saw Tony Yazbec and he was awesome. This place is really about the show. Drinks come second only to the show. I had a caipirinha one of my most favorite cocktails in the world and it was very good. Not Rio de Janeiro good but very good.Now. About the food. The food might be oookaaay depending on what you order. I made the mistake of ordering mussles. This was a double mistake since this occurred only one week after I went to Flex Mussels and experienced what mussels are really supposed to be like. DO NOT order the mussels at Birdland. They are the paltriest saddest most rubbery little mussels in the entire universe. And while so much of the joy of eating mussels is dipping a loaf of bread in the broth the bread basket at Birdland is truly the worst. I mean. The. Worst. It has the most cardboard texture in the world. You can't even believe it until you try it. As a serious bread lover I kept eating it hoping it would somehow magically turn into a Balthazaar loaf but unsurprisingly it did not. The saddest part about the terrible bread was that the broth which the sad paltry little mussels were cooked in was actually the best aspect of the whole dish but short of sipping it with a spoon there was no satisfying way to get it to my tongue. If Birdland's primary purpose was to serve food I would never step foot in there again and I would take stars off of this review but since that is not its purpose I will just say you may want to consider eating elsewhere before you go and sticking with drinks at the venue.All that off my chest I really do recommend checking it out for a show and a cocktail. I've never been anyplace else like it." u"The food is very blend the service is ok... Very blend Cajun Jambalaya. It should be removed from the menu and there is no crawfish I only experience chicken and sausage in the entire dish. Concert has not began after 30mins past starting showtime. I'm not impressed quiet disappointed." u"My best friend had his Cap21 graduation performance at Birdland and it was an amazing sold out show. The spacing was beautiful inside and I was reserved a VIP seating up in the front. I've seen this group first perform 2 years ago and have seen their progression over the years. This last performance was definitely one of their finest. Also it was so nice to see actual broadway stars who graduated from the Cap21 program to make a special appearance at birdland last night including Molly Hager from Waitress. It was definitely a fun crowd great performance and an amazing turnout for a Monday night. I wish these guys all the best in their broadway careers. Food wise I ordered their calamari and it were delicious!" u"I came to see Stacey Kent and she was amazing as expected. \xa0I hope to see her again come December. \xa0Birdland is probably one of my favorite jazz clubs in the city... more for their amazing performers than the venue itself. \xa0Don't get me wrong the venue design was ok but the service food and drinks were lacking. \xa0We came early but was still sat way off to the side. \xa0Apparently you might be able to score the coveted seats in the middle if you stake out at the bar early on before doors open. \xa0Not sure how that would work. \xa0I was pretty disappointed with my seat choice given how much I paid and how early I came." u"We ventured here on a Sunday night where they have the Afro-Latin band. Made up of approximately 18 people w stayed for the 9pm and 11pm sets. What a treat for the ears! And for the wallet as its only $30 per person with a $10 minimum drink or food charge. There's not a bad seat in the house! The band is also super friendly and approachable. Onto food and drink- I had a mojito which was perfection. I ordered a red stuffed pepper filled with mushroom risotto and placed im in a bed of cooked spinach that swims in a yellow tomato sauce. Yummmmm. Someone ordered a BBQ salmon salad which looked good and the salmon was cooked perfectly but it's just not as exotic and pales in comparison to other dishes.My only constructive criticism is the bread- it was heated up but tasted stale and was just unappetizing.I highly recommend this place- where else can you get a huge band within a stones throw distance AND delicious food and drink?" u'This is ridiculous we came more then an hour before the show. The club was EMPTY! We had reservations. And they give us a table in the very back of the room. There were like 30 other empty tables and it was the only option according to our waitress. Horrible attitude!' u"Insanely good music. \xa0The Airfrance presents Django Reinhardt NY Festival at Birdland Jazz club has to be the best value in town for 50 bucks. \xa0The musicians are wonderul the food is very good and there's not a bad seat in the house. \xa0You're an idiot if you miss this. These guys came here after playing the Newport Jazz Festival to standing Os." u'The place comes from Charlie Parker who was nick named the Yardbird or the Bird. \xa0Though he did not play here that often. The original Birdland was located somewhere else. I came to see the Marcus Roberts Trio and the Modern Generation. \xa0This is a relatively small club and the seating capacity is only about 140 I think. \xa0For the show at 8:30 pm you can only gets in at 7:30 pm. \xa0If you want to get in earlier you will be charged a half price ticket for the previous show which is another $20. \xa0The place also cater for dinner. \xa0I had Crabcake Sandwiches it comes with fries I read the review of this sandwich that is why I ordered it. \xa0I found the Crabcake is just so so the ratio of crab meats and binder is really not that great. \xa0 My buddy had Roasted Free-Range Chicken with Garlic Mashed Potatoes that seems to be nicer. We had a bottle of Beaujolais Noveau 2014 and it was great. \xa0Service is nice and the music from the Marcus Roberts Trio and The Modern Generation is great a wonderful night out.' u'Always have a good time when we are here. The acts are always really talented and professional seating and hosts are very efficient and the drinks are excellent. Menu is good the food comes out fast and never disappointed. We look forward to coming here alone or with guests great place to spend a few hours.' u"Friday night and I was looking for a Jazz club while visiting NYC. \xa0I've been to Birdland years before and decided to give it another shot for $35 + fees per ticket. \xa0With 9pm and 11pm choices I elected for the 11pm.Creole and American food on the menu and it actually looked good. \xa0Beforehand I ate a huge meal so I wasn't a player in this game. \xa0But don't shy away from trying a little something somethingGreat setting. \xa0I took a chance on performers I didn't know and well not the best jazz I've ever heard. \xa0It was fine for an hour or so and then I was outta there.Overall very nice and sweet service. \xa0Note to self research the performers before choosing to come here again (and note to you!)." u'Saw an early show with Barbara Carroll doing jazz piano accompanied by a bassist. She is a classy performer playing romantic tunes that put us in a loving mood. She especially loved the Gershwins and played them expertly. The acoustics in the place are great.The venue itself is intimate with dim decor and tables close to the stage. There was a small crowd when we went but they were into the show. There is no talking allowed given the intimate nature of the space and the show lasted about 65-70 minutes.The food looked and smelled good cajun and creole in style but we just stuck to drinks. There is a $10 per person minimum which we thought was reasonable. They have a small list of $8 beers (bottles only no draft). We had a guinness extra blue moon and a glass of the house white wine. All hit the spot.We were very happy with this memorable performance and would love to try it again. They have later shows as well.' u"I was going through the photo album on my phone and found these pictures taken at Birdland and thought I can review that. So here I am putting my two cents. Birdland has to be one of the few poshest places I have been to. Bzzzzz peasant detected. I mean I even had pictures of this place. But anyway my visit was last spring and with a friend. My memory might be lost regarding little details but overall I remember it being a satisfactory experience. Food-wise my friend and I shared a artichoke dip and I ordered meself a dish of baked fish. The artichoke dip was the bomb; it was warm cheesy creamy and pairing with those naughty crisps I could only hear myself chewing and crisps breaking during the whole performance. In comparison the baked fish was a bit under the shadow; it was bland and was not memorable at all. But it was of huge portion and came with a side of healthy veg; I remember having large appetite I didn't get through half of it.Performance-wise I didn't remember many details about it. It was definitely a great performance by two very famous jazz musicians; there were applauses and there were people standing up and applauding at the same time. Music connoisseurs might be able to help me recognize from the photos (God I felt I have already insulted loads of music lovers here). So overall it was a great experience; I have even written an essay about it. Oh wait why don't I just find the paper and put it here? Awwww too bad I can't find it. Pat pat I know you are all eager to see it. PS. I haven't seen my friend ever since our visit here. If you are out there reading it just press whatever button is here so that we can catch up!" u'Fantastic evening with my friends! \xa0The food was ok but the music was fantastic! Great nite out!' u'Now I must admit I knew NOTHING about jazz my bf did and this was a surprise date for him... Found this place at the very last minute and got the best seats in the house FRONT ROW!!!!! We had the pleasure to see Catherine Russell & Her Sextet..... For a first timer I gave a standing ovation....the melodies the instruments being used was so on point her voice gave me the chills....I WILL go back to experience more jazz artists in the near future...' u'A MUST for any Jazz Lover. \xa0We stopped in after a show in time to catch a special performance by Nicholas Payton Trio with Peter Washington and Carl Allen. We were immediately met at the door by a very friendly and accommodating manager who quietly explained the cover and escorted us to our seats which (after moving a couple of times) were right next to the stage - in line of the keyboard (perfect seats). We paid $40 each to get in and noticed right away - this a was a show not a club. There was little or no talking going on and everyone was mesmerized by the performance. We were immediately drawn into the music and performances. \xa0Everyone on staff was whispering and ducking when moving around - so as not to interrupt. \xa0The place was dimly lit and the focus was obviously on the music. I wish I could have come back before we left.' u'Good broad offering of Jazz. Great enjoyable venue. Decent food. Always a good time!' u"Had a birthday celebration there and I can't say enough how much I love the music. \xa0Would plan to go back in near future." u'small venue for jazz lovers! Price was $40 per person. The entire place holds maybe 100 people. We watched a big band/jazz group that was outstanding!!! We had great seats (all seats are the same price) and we also enjoyed dessert during the show.If you like jazz you must come here!']
21.Becco,[u"I loved this restaurant. I took a trip to New York a couple months ago and after a horrible dinner one night we decided we needed a really great meal. I mean it's New York for crying out loud. This place had great reviews and who doesn't like Italian???We got the arancini for an appetizer which was really really yummy but small. It only came with three pieces but probably would have been better if it came with five. The hummus/olive oil dip for the bread was really delicious as well. All the meals came with a caesar salad which was a nice start \xa0before the main dish. I got one of the specials that night which was a pan seared halibut with olive mashed potatoes and it was delicious. It was perfectly cooked. Everybody else's food was delicious as well it was nice to share. We each got different desserts as well and they were all great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the price in relation to the portion size but it's a popular New York restaurant so what was I really expecting? I would definitely recommend going if you're looking for great restaurant in the area. Our waiter was also great by the way! Super nice!" u'No matter how many stars are able to give Becco deserves all of them!Each time I go they always go out of their way to take special care of me and any plans I may have following the meal. Most of the time I choose the special but have also ordered off the menu.The food is always beyond my wildest expectations in the service is outstanding. Everyone seems to have an impeccable understanding of the menu and can explain any question I may have. \xa0Reservations are recommended.' u"Becco is one of my favorite restaurants in New York. It was opened by celebrity chefs Lidia Bastianich and her son Joe [Master Chef]. It is a popular spot in Hell's Kitchen for lunch or dinner before and after Broadway shows. It is always hopping. I generally come here for the unlimited pasta Sinfonia di Paste for $19.95. The pastas are handmade and different every time. The price and pasta are awesome so you do not need to come here for Restaurant Week to get a great deal. Nevertheless everything else I have eaten here is awesome. I really enjoyed the steak too.If you are looking for places to try for Restaurant Week \xa0feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my person list which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile." u"A famous place in Hell's Kitchen tat I always wanted to check out. Finally came here with a friend. I made reservation a few days ago - not difficult to book a weekday night dinner. When I stepped in I realized this place is large! It is been divided into various sections so you won't see much people in one area but summing all up it is a big restaurant compared to other ones in Hell's Kitchen. They offer a long wine list here. The food is ordinary-nothing creative in the menu. My friend and I ordered salad and mussel to share. Salad was okay but we didn't like the mussel - it tasted bitter. We also chose braised pork and steak. Both were just so-so. To me it doesn't quite deserve all the famous compliment given to this place. Another friend who checked out this place before told us this is s tourist restaurant. I don't know if that's true but definitely think it needs more creative menu and better quality food to compete with tons of other wonderful restaurants nearby." u'My recent trips to Italia have changed my food preferences forever! \xa0However my love of Lidia\'s Becco has not changed. Becco;s Galletto \'al Forno\' reminds one of a little taste of Firenze--crispy fresh free range chicken with spring onion risotto. \xa0The friendly Hell\'s Kitchen service leaves me saying: "Prego e Arrivederci!"' u'What more can I say that hasn\'t already been said?! Nothing much really but I knew I still had to give my 2cents! Their pasta special has great value - as in $25 bucks for ALL YOU CAN EAT pasta (with a choice of THREE PASTAS which you can have ALL THREE!!! Sorry as you can see I\'m very excited.) and a choice of seafood anti-pesto or Caesar salad. The pastas that night were tomato rigatoni shrimp fettucine and spinach gnudi (all of which were very delicious btw. My favs were the rigatoni and gnudi.) Their complimentary bread with hummus olive oil and olives was also a very nice touch. Be sure to check out their $29 bottle wine list. Their concept behind this was "We created this wine list to remove the inhibition & confusion of price from your wine selection. We encourage you to explore the many styles & great values here." I must admit I came here because of the Joe Bastianich hype and with not that high of expectations but left with my expectations exceeded. \xa0tl:dr: Service is great food is delicious value is exceptional portions are huge and ambiance is rustic. I love this place.' u'I felt Becco was a stellar "after the play restaurant " and I really liked the concept of the three course meal offering.If you order an entree it comes with a starter caesar salad and for an additional $9 you could add on a second course of three daily fresh pasta dishes. \xa0That would be too much food for me so I opted for their caesar salad and unlimited serving of the three daily pasta dishes for just under $25. \xa0The pastas offered the day I went were a \xa0shrimp fettuccine (which was prepared a way I had never had and was my favorite) a penne pasta with marinara sauce (the sauce was good but the pasta seemed store bought and not made in house) and the last was some sort of brown butter gnocchi with spinach (very delicious but also very rich).Not sure I would go here if not already in the area for something else but it did not disappoint!' u"Another odd thing ... considering I've eaten here so many times that I actually made it through the entire menu and never wrote about this place.But I digress.I often like to recommend this place to people who are looking for a great Italian place in the city. \xa0I like how this place serves great food but offers a warm cozy and casual atmosphere that fits all types of occasions. \xa0My personal favorites on the menu have consistently been the baked shrimp appetizer the Osso Bucco and their fish of the day which is prepared with a subtle hint of olive oil and sea salts. \xa0I am also a big fan of their dessert menu and will always opt for the panna cotta or zabaglioni whenever possible.But keep in mind the portions here are GENEROUS. \xa0If you order a meat dish .. such as the ribeye or the veal parm YOU WILL BE STUFFED. \xa0Unless you have a huge appetite (like me and even I've been consistently taken down by the sheer volume of the meat dishes barring the Osso Bucco) you might want to keep the big helpings of food in mind. The pasta special is another great part of the menu. \xa0There's always a big variety of offerings each day .. but personally I like it whenever they offer the shrimp arribiata or squid ink pastas. \xa0But you can't go wrong with their ravioli options as well or the penne .. or the clam linguni. \xa0If that's what you're looking for it might be good to call and just check to see what the special is ahead of time just to make sure. \xa0But the price you pay for that can't be beat. \xa0They also have a good selection of reasonably priced wines.The atmosphere here is very lively. \xa0It can get crazy loud especially if you're upstairs or in one of the side rooms by the bar where the seats are pretty close to each other. \xa0However there is no doubt this is a popular place for pre and after theater meals. \xa0The service here is friendly as well. \xa0Personally I like lively places but sometimes it can feel a bit too crazy for me so usually I'll only come here with friends as opposed to meals when I actually have to hear myself or the other person talk. \xa0Overall this place is one of the best Italian joints in the Theater District in terms of overall value food quality service and if you like a place that's boisterous and high energy." u"We decided that we would watch a show on Thursday night at the last minute. The show started at 8:15 so I pulled up Yelp to find a great place for a 6:15 dinner and that's how we ended up at Becco in Hells Kitchen.We arrived at 6:15 without a reservation and the place was packed! I think it's a popular spot for pre theatre dinner crowd because they really thinned out when we left around 7:45. The hostess was great and sat us at a table for 2 in the room with the bar. There were no table cloths on these tables but we didn't really care about that.Immediately upon sitting down a beautiful tray of bread was placed on the table along with olives and I think hummus. They added olive oil to the hummus and I added a little salt and pepper. Yum! I literally said I think that this may be my favorite restaurant of the entire trip thus far! Based solely on service alone.A waitress gave us the low down on the menu and we order a bottle of wine. $29! They have a whole page full of wine selections for $29. We go with her recommendation for a medium bodied wine. It was ok good with dinner.Not really understanding exactly how much food is served we may have over ordered.First we ordered the carpaccio perfectly thin delicious slices of raw beef topped with arugula Parmesan cheese olive oil salt and pepper. Really excellent Then we ordered the veal piccata special and the stuffed peppers. The entrees come with a Cesar salad and for $9 more we added a sampler of the fresh pasta special as a midi dish.The service is on point. I'm officially thrilled at the find!The table is super small and I was a little worried that there wouldn't be enough room for anything else. Not to worry they serve you the salad on your plates and they take away the salad plate after. Salad was goodNext the pasta midi dish! We got new plates one waiter comes by and dishes a few ravioli on our plates (4-5 huge ravioli) then another waiter comes by with the penne with tomato basil sauce and finally another dishes the pappardelle with stewed rabbit. Holy crow it's a meal in and of itself! The penne was good. The pappardelle fresh pasta was on point but the sauce and rabbit were uninspired not my favorite. I love mushrooms but the ravioli seemed overly mushroom if that make sense just ok for me. I did notice that many people ordered the for the special of salad and unlimited pasta but I would skip the midi if I could do it over.The stuffed peppers stewed in tomato was good probably better if I wasn't stuffed already. It did inspire me to go home and make my own version of this item.Veal piccata was well cooked good sear on outside and juicy inside but a little too tart.Ambiance 5/5 reminds me of an Italian restaurant in Italy Value 5/5 Food 3.99/5 it pains me but they're just a little offService 5/5 amazingly attentive but not over bearingRestrooms or WC 5/5 very cleanIf you've got plans to see a show or if you're in the area give this place a try." u'Terrific place before theatre - I had the limon chicken which was delicious Am gluten fee so was unable to eat the pasta but it looked delicious Great panna cotta and sorbet dessert' u"I don't often write reviews unless the place is a great find great value or so bad I want you to stay away. \xa0With Becco I'm torn. \xa0I used to work in the area and have frequented Becco before for lunch. \xa0Food was good then but the quality and service has gone downhill. \xa0Time has passed Broadway is alive again tourists love NYC and Joe Bastianich has become a household name. \xa0Maybe TV stardom requires too much of his time and as such Joe has let Becco slip out of his grips of control and has let Becco become synonymous with the term Tourist Trap.Some positives:- The pasta dishes were cooked well meaning they were al dente. \xa0Not necessarily cooked with great flavors nor with quality ingredients.- Bread sticks were nice and crunchy.- Calamari was well breaded and fried.- The bus boys and runners were very quick.And this is where the positives stop.On to the long running list of negatives from start to end of the meal:- The front of the restaurant is extremely noisy. \xa0Also the aircon vents will drip on you during the summer months. \xa0Try to reserve a table in the back.- Since the aircon was dripping on us the manager was good to move us to the back once a table opened up. But once the food came no one ever came back to check on us.Food: Not a good value at all.- With such a big name and many reviews you would think the food is great but it's not.- Osso Buco meat was cooked well but the sauce was overly sweet for no reason.- Sword fish was overcooked and the accompanying corn side was under seasoned.- Seabass was overcooked and could have possibly been halibut.- Seafood pasta was lacking in flavor and scallops tasted frozen.- Beef carpaccio was full of parmesan cheese; you couldn't even really taste the beef.And here's the most disappointing thing...if you saw a menu that listed all-you-can-eat pasta for $25 wouldn't you think it was a promo at Olive Garden?As a native NYer I'm sad that this restaurant has gone downhill. \xa0There are so many better Italian restaurants in the city so please go explore those gems. \xa0If you have to eat in the Theatre District try another restaurant.And please please please TOURISTS stop rating this restaurant so highly. \xa0The food is not that good at all. \xa0You will find better food in this great city!I'm so sad about this experience that I will have to post this review onto another site as well.Thanks for reading." u"Yes. \xa0If you haven't been to Becco's then it is definitely worth a visit. \xa0Busy of course. \xa0Service was inconsistent when we went recently. \xa0But the food is very good. \xa0The grilled Branzino was perfectly prepared and seasoned nicely with herbs and lemon. \xa0Pastas were all good \xa0And the meatball for appetizer were so good. \xa0Good enough to come back again just for those.Portions were large and a good value. \xa0We were seated at 6:15 and out in plenty of time for an 8:00 show at Richard Rogers theater." u"A variety of wine at all price points. \xa0My entire party ordered the all you can eat homemade pasta option. \xa0Even though I'm a vegetarian they accommodated me by making a special pan of the \xa0one meat sauce pasta dish they were serving that night. \xa0Service was great. I'd definitely recommend reservations if you are heading for dinner before a show." u'This is going to be short and sweet. \xa0It\'s 5 stars. \xa0The food the atmosphere and pricing are all unbelievable. \xa0The food is beautiful Italian food the way my grandmother makes it. \xa0The variety is amazing. \xa0The pricing is utterly unbelievable. \xa0Food:They had an "unlimited pasta special" for the night we were there of linguine with shrimp in a truffle oil homemade bowtie pasta in a light beautiful marinara sauce and a homemade mushroom ravioli.Price:Oh did I mention it was 24 dollars for all 3 unlimited amounts of the special? \xa0Yeah enough said...Atmosphere:NYC...yup that\'s about all you have to say.Service:Superb. \xa0The waiters and waitresses are attentive but not stuffy and constantly on top of you. \xa0If the food wasn\'t so amazing the manager (Chad if i\'m not mistaken) would\'ve been the best part of our dinner. \xa0He was personable and knowledgeable. \xa0Extremely friendly and made conversation but was not all over us.Overall:Just amazing. \xa0It\'s literally my new favorite restaurant. \xa0Period.' u"Becco is a solid place on Restaurant Row and a very good post-theater option if you're looking to stay close. I think its reviews here benefit some from its location -- it stands out among many of the tourist traps -- and I was somewhat torn between going with 3 or 4 but I think if you put this place somewhere further downtown it wouldn't get quite the same relative benefit. That said the food is good -- you get your money's worth with the pasta sampler and it's better than it should be given that the waiters carry around enormous plates of it and carry it around table-to-table. The apps are good too (especially anything mozzarella-based) and the desserts are legitimately excellent (especially the chocolate mousse cake).I like this place and I would definitely recommend if you're in the area but I don't think it's worth a special trip." u"Let me start by saying the food here is really good. I could not rate it higher than 2 stars because of the awful experience we had here. First off my Mother is older and has bad legs and cant climb stairs. When I found out we would be sitting in the upstairs dining room I asked the hostess if it would be possible to wait for a table downstairs. I explained that my Mom is elderly and suffers with leg and C.O.P.D. issues. I was told no and that the good thing is they have a bathroom so Mom doesn't have to climb the stairs more than once. Gee thanks. Needless to say Mom was out of breath and her legs were killing her.The server was equally as bad. Rushed us to order. Yelled at my wife about knife placement. Also would not allow substitutions on dishes and looked at some in my party like they had 3 heads with simple requests. They even brought dinner before we had finished our appetizers. Three people had to hold their plate and eat off of it. The whole dinner seemed so rushed just to turn tables. The space upstairs is ridiculously tight as well. We were so put off on this whole experience. That needless to say we wont be back. And its a shame because we had been going here for years. The food isn't that amazing to endure this type of treatment. Shame on you Lydia you should be more hands on!" u"Ok so maybe my view of Italian food is skewed because we don't really have any decent Italian places where I live. But....this place is AMAZING! We did the prix fixe menu and holy cow! SO good! I had the antipasto platter for my salad and I have never had such deliciousness! The octopus was cooked perfectly as was everything else on the plate. There were 3 options for dinner and they just came around and put whatever you wanted on your plate served out of big bowls! I think there was a mushroom ravioli and a marinara but what stood out to me the most was the linguine and clams. So delicious!I will definitely be back here on my next trip to NY. Love this place!!!!" u"Alright people here's the deal. \xa0If you are looking for solid Italian food in the Times Square area or pre show meal this is a great place to go. \xa0I few things to note though. \xa0It WILLL be crowded lots of tourists in this area so you WILL have to wait. \xa0But just have this in mind !The bread to start was delicious and came to the table right away. \xa0 Becco has unlimited pasta for 24 bucks includes a Caesar salad OR antipasta. \xa0Pretty good deal of you are hungry. \xa0Every day they have 3 different pastas to choose from. \xa0The waiters come around with big bowls of each pasta to refill your plate. \xa0Like others have noted the second refill was really slow and we had to ask someone to come around because we wanted more of the artichoke ravioli which was delicious !!!Also the lemon chicken was SO GOOD !! My sister is a lemon chicken connoisseur and said this as the best she's ever had ! Last but not least the gelato and chocolate mousse cake were a great way to end the meal !" u'It was our first and last time here! \xa0First we had reservations for 6:30PM and showed up on time and they couldn\'t find our reservation and claimed it "didn\'t exist" then we showed them the online reservation receipt that we had and they searched their systems for our phone number and magically found our reservations....really now?? \xa0Strike 1!We ordered the unlimited 3-pasta dish the Gamberi al Forno and the Calamari. \xa0The calamari was ok the shrimp al forno in spicy tomato sauce was a little too bready all of the appetizers came out at a reasonable time but once we were done with the appetizers that is when the wait took forever. \xa0 We waited almost 1 hour for our main entree to come out how long does it take to make PASTA??? \xa0I could\'ve heated up 40+ cans of Chef Boyardee ravioli in the time it took them to bring out my pasta! \xa0The pasta also came with a "Caesar Salad" starter and they didn\'t even think to bring that to us until we mentioned the wait. \xa0When we questioned the server about where our food was he simply said "it\'s coming" really? \xa0It\'s coming? \xa0Well so is Christmas! \xa0Strike 2!Finally our food arrived and the pasta itself is alright if you want to have good pasta I recommend you go to "Pepe Rosso To Go" on Sullivan Street! \xa0There was a guy who worked at the restaurant who kept walking around to every table and asking how everything was. \xa0When he reached our table we explained our \'problem\' and that we were still waiting for the food he apologized and went to check on it. \xa0He came back with some lame excuse about not wanting to rush us as we were still eating our appetizers. \xa0Uh we had finished our appetizers and 40 minutes had passed before I spoke to someone wondering where the hell our entrees were. \xa0They decided to comp us with free sorbetti. \xa0When I asked for the check they charged us $8.00 for the sorbetti!! \xa0Strike 3!This is definitely the last time this place will be having my business!' u'True fans of Italian food need look no further than Becco for some of the best Italian in midtown. I strongly recommend getting a reservation on Open Table before making your way down Restaurant Row - they tend to fill up nightly. I don\'t think I\'ve ever gotten anything other than their pasta special: Sinfonia Di Paste (unlimited table side service of Executive Chef William Gallagher\'s Three Daily Pasta Preparations). You start with either an assortment of marinated & grilled vegetables with assorted seafood (Antipasto Misto) or a classic Caesar Salad. Both are excellent choices depending on your taste. There\'s also excellent bread and spicy olives aplenty. Then sit back and devour more pasta than your body should consume served until you say "no thank you." Three choices often include an option with meat some sort of spaghetti and a gnocchi. All subject to change at any moment. I\'ve only had the same pasta a few times in my many visits so there\'s a lot of variety. Be sure to check out their $29 bottle list in the main menu (not the wine menu). Otherwise you can also grab just a glass of wine for around $10. \xa0If you\'ve got room for dessert more power to you. I strongly advise the Dessert Sampler. Just to make sure you go into a food coma.']
20.Sushi Ginza Onodera,[u'There is absolutely no experience that will compare to my dinner at Sushi Ginza Onodera. It was like nothing else-- personal attention from both the chef and manager... yes they escort every patron outside to say goodbye. We ordered the Premium course Kiwami and a bottle of saki. Before our bottle of saki was presented we chose our own glasses from their selection. \xa0Some spotlight dishes included: cuddle fish; barracuda; uni; monk fish liver; and conch. I cannot exaggerate how fresh and delicious every course was. When asked how it was I frequently stumble over my words because I cannot express how incredible Sushi Ginza Onodera was so please go and experience it for yourself.' u'A bit pricey for what was offered but Onodera is one of the more authentic sushi restaurants in north america. Rice was not up to the traditional high standards you would see in Japan but the overall craftsmanship is better than most other US sushi places. All in all I think this is the most authentic sushi restaurant in NYC.Chef Saito was friendly hilarious and interesting. Service from the waiting staff was impeccable too.' u'Best of the best! Staff: very very friendly and professorial Food: highest quality of the all Chef: very funny and professional Will for sure come back to visit!!! I feel like I was back in Japan while I was eating in this restaurant.' u'Awesome! I like this restaurant. They provide very good food and service.' u"Another new sushi omakase in town. Tried their 'premium omakase' tonight.Relatively easy to make counter seating reservation by phone for now.A treat to have Chef Yohei prepare all the dishes and sushi. He is helping out at the NYC restaurant before he heads out to LA in August to become the head chef for the Onodera restaurant in Beverly Hills.It's expensive but if you speak Japanese you can learn a lot from the chef about the fish ingredients preparation history source etc. Learned from him the Edo style of preparation use of red vinegar for the sushi rice the huge abalone they use is very difficult to acquire can acquire only a small piece of the cheek meat from the tuna the uni they use is not the ones that come in a package but they actually crack open the sea urchins themselves the difficulty in getting the fish from Tokyo fish market to NYC etc. When you learn about all this information from the chef the cost of the omakase is justified imo.In addition I assure you that you will not find many of their unique sushi offered here in other NYC restaurants. Also the portion size of the fish for each sushi is easily 2-3X that you find at other high-end sushi restaurants in NYC. Lastly impecabble service. Gratuity is included.I had a good chuckle because the staff including the chef came outside the restaurant to say goodbye in Japanese style with the bow and all but they basically stood there for a long time until we were clearly out of sight at least three blocks away. Pretty unique especially for NYC which is not known for politeness.This place is a gem and I plan to come back again. : 10 calendars" u"I have been eating sushi for many years but I've never had real Japanese sushi. I usually get the packaged $15 sushi boxes in supermarkets or sushi rolls in common Japanese restaurants. The experience at Sushi Ginza Onodera completely changed my perspective on sushi. I can never go back to the regular stuff and I say that's for the better!I chose the $400 dinner omakase. From start to finish every dish was a surprise and a work of art. The evening went on and the plates kept coming. Each plate came at the right place in the order. It was like watching a good play - full of drama. My most memorable dishes include monk fish liver abalone egg custard topped with caviar chutoro and otoro tuna. They were all wonderful.When the dinner ended I walked toward the door followed by my waitress and sushi chef. At the door outside they gave me a bow at an angle that looked too deep for comfort. As I walked away I thought I should take a photo with the chef. I ran back while he was still there. He was more than happy to take a photo with me.The whole experience was above and beyond." u"I've been to all the best sushi restaurants in NYC (Masa Nobu Blue Ribbon Brush Stroke Kuru Yasuda Hatsuhana Sakagura 15 East) and this is hands down the best and terms of quality of fish and service. You basically have your own sushi chef and server throughout the evening. Your 2 choices for the evening are a $300 or $400 omakase. I got the $300 but regret not getting the $400. Its that good! The quality of fish was amazing! Properly rested and the perfect temp. They also have a wide variety of sake and get to choose your own crystal glass. After you're done your chef and server walk you out of the restaurant and send you off with a deeeeep bow. Absolutely amazing! A must try for fancy sushi lovers!" u"I've dined here twice at lunch. First of all they have the best sushi rice in nyc which is most important! They use 2 red vinegars - light and thick mix - which gives the rice a nice and tangy flavor. It's my first time seeing a \xa0sushi ya in the states that uses red vinegar.. very nice. Fish are almost all wild and mostly from Japan. I liked everything about this place from gari to the shari. Nice hinoki wood counter and zen interior. I need to check the dinner course someday which is quite expensive. I will see if the price tag is worth it..but from what I hear the seafood that \xa0comes out during dinner should be worth it. Saito san is the best and quite entertaining." u"Came here for lunch. You have three choices $70 $100 $130 \xa0I had $130 which include 1 appetizer egg curd miso soup desert and 15 piece of sushi. The fish piece cut is generous so it is very filling and satisfying. I thought the fish quality was very good and the sushi tasted very good but not mind blowing. I guess for lunch the fish selection won't be as superior as dinner which makes sense as dinner will be charged much more. I will go to try dinner and see how it goes hope that will blow my mind away. But I have to say for $130 it is amazing deal it is the best it can go. Especially it already includes tip.The atmosphere is great bright lovely and perfect mixture of traditional sushi restaurant with modern elements. The chefs are fun and professional and waitress are polite and sweet. After lunch they even walked me out of restaurant stood outside of restaurant kindly said good bye to me and saw me walking away. Felt like to be treated as japanese royal family." u'The fish was way cut way too big off balance texture between under seasoned and undercooked rice and massive slice off fish.The kinmedai was "cured" but it tasted incredibly slimy and not fresh. Sad. The most over priced over rated sushi in NYC. Save your money and eat at sushi Zo twice.' u"The food is nice and deserves 3 1/2 stars and the extra 1/2 star is to reward the most Japanese service one can find in this time zone. This restaurant opened yesterday and serves two omakase menus: a regular one for $300 and a premium one for $400 including tip. We went for the premium one and were served 21 pieces of sushi and sashimi plus miso soup and dessert. The fish was all from Japan and good. The highlights of the night were:- the soy and sugar marinated octopus served with yuzukosho; it was very tender and flavourful. - tairagai the Japanese razor clam also called pen shell clam wrapped in seaweed. The attraction of the dish was more about texture than flavour. - the squid which was tender.- the wild cherry trout- the charred sea bass. I loved the char and savory taste. - the uni topped with charred beef and truffle. This dish was very nice but the sea urchin taste was lost in there- the uni. It was very fresh. The best with in NYC with Nakazawa. - the green tea and coconut pana cotta \xa0it was a nice mix of bitterness and slightly sweetness. The service was effective and very polite. Maybe a menu listing all the fish of the night would nicely supplement the sushi chef's explanations. The best part of service was the very Japanese goodbye by the chef and staff who bowed to us on the street." u'This place is simply sensational. \xa0Best sushi I\'ve had outside of Japan. \xa0Head chef has a relaxed and welcoming personality - making it especially enjoyable. \xa0Atmosphere is elegant and formal yet also relaxed and personable. \xa0Highly recommend to anyone interested in an "authentic" sushi experience.' u'Had the $300 omakase meal which includes gratuity. The presentation and quality of every course were top top notch. Each nigiri tasted very fresh and meaty. My favorites were the monkfish liver (which was very rich and reminded me of foie gras) and uni (which tasted incredibly fresh and buttery). The service was amazing and better than other high end sushi restaurants in Manhattan. We basically had our own personal sushi chef and waitress. It was such a treat to have Chef Yohei prepare our meal. He always had a smile on his face. As others have said the chef and wait staff walk you out as you exit and gives you the warmest send off.' u"The best and I have tried most high end sushi places in NYC... I'm in love.....If you like sushi this is the place to go. I wish it wasn't this expensive though so I could go every week. lol" u"I wish my budget allows dinner here every night. Like all the other reviews no question the best sushi in the U.S.experienced. I mentioned to the waitress I do not eat farmed fish if that is an option not to include and she said ALL their fish is wild. The sauces spices marinades and fish quality are better than any of its peers 15 East Ichimura Masa (ok maybe not the ultra premium toro as rich as foie gras that's scrapped off by a shell ) and even my used to be favorite Nakazawa. The rice is heavier on the vinegar and not as jammed packed together  better than Tanoshi's and Yasuda's for my personal taste.It's the Michael Jordan of sushi all around best."]
209.Bubba Gump Shrimp,[u'The most delicious shrimp in NYC I order :1- I\'m stuffed \xa0shrimp its good but I don\'t like the fishy taste of crab in this dish 2- shrimp new orleans "really it\'s my order"I like the mix of taste which is lemon with spice and butter and some sweet taste 3- jinny\'s catch with lobster butter sauce really it\'s the most delicious dish I was order .. Really I want to hug the chef for this dish I loved so much 4- forrest seafood feast it\'s taste good especially the shrimp ant fries but the fish it\'s fried with much of oil I think ! But order it\'s yummy and big dish ( serve 4 per) Drink:Frozen lemon ups! Really it\'s like summer vibes so yummy and cold contain strawberries sauce I think and piece of strawberries Finally I am a muslim girl and my religion prohibit me to drink alcohol and eat pork And This restaurant respect my religion when I was ask waiter to ask the chef about pork and the waiter is so honesty' u"I enjoyed the experience of dining here only because of the theme - Forrest Gump obviously. If you're a fan of the movie you'll have fun here. It's filled with decor and menu items reminiscent of the different characters and movie moments. It's definitely a cute place to eat and a must-try if you're in Times Square. With all that being said I didn't think the food was out-of-this-world. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was just basic shrimp cocktail nothing special. The fish on the Dixie Fishwich was pretty tasty but it came out lukewarm and the fries were nothing special. The only thing I ordered that I truly enjoyed and would order again was the Strawberry Speckled Lemonade. They gave me a free Bubba Gump cup with the order that I picked up after my meal from the gift shop. It was a nice souvenir for my visit. I'm sure that gift shop gets big hits from other tourists. All in all I'd say that if you're a fan of the movie definitely go here and have the experience." u"The Accidental Tourist is the way to go every time. Don't get the Shrimp Pasta Dish get the grilled Accidental fish. This specific restaurant is right in the middle and hustle bustle of New York's infamous Time Square and let me say that it is BUSY. The employees however do a great job at staying on task and doing their job quickly and efficiently. Our party of 5 only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table (go in and get your name on the list quickly though).I know I'm special and my momma tells me that too but our waitress made us feel like a million bucks! It was great to get our drink orders right away and our food came out rather fast as well. It is a bit on the pricey side so if you're down to splurge go right ahead. Otherwise their serving sizes are pretty big and great to share. (I bet you had a box of chocolates to help you make it through this review huh? Don't worry I'm almost through). All in all a fun night and a great way to top of our touristy adventures. TIPS & TRICKS: * While you wait for your meal check out the gift shop attached. There are some fun trinkets you might like to bring home with you--but don't purchase anything until you're through eating otherwise you're lugging around sacks of clothes and that's just no fun. * If you don't have a large group ask to be seated at the bar. They offer a full menu and you'll get seated quicker. * Don't forget to finish your meal off with the Skillet Cookie complete with ice cream whipped cream and peanuts it's sure to leave you feeling perfectly full." u"This place is right at the heart of Times Square so it's full with tourists. So it's really no reason to go there unless 1) you lose a dare or 2) you are hungry late in the night and in the area or 3) you like cool display of bright neon signboard lights from outside the window. The food here is nothing special. The calamari appetizer is alright. Perfect size serving and good breading but I don't like the dip sauces. Too sour and overpowering. The Jumbo Shrimper's Net Catch garlic sauce shrimp is too salty I feel like they are still drenched in sea water. The Cajun sauce shrimp is a lot better but after like 5 shrimps you'll get tired of them. So share your catch around the table preferably among 20 of you.I applaud their servers though friendly with lots of smile and lots of energy. If it's your birthday they clap and sing for you it looks fun. But then why would you celebrate your birthday there? I also like that they have the amount of calories for every items in the menu. It takes a lot of courage to put entrees with almost 1500 calories there. It really is." u'Cool atmosphere and almost always busy. It is a fun place for sure! The staff are friendly. Great view over Times Square! Food is slightly better than average American chain food. But it is a bit too expensive most dishes over 15 dollars and the better ones around 20. The coconut tilapia is a good one. They also have a lot of cool drinks.I came here because I had lived in NYC for some time already but never tried Bubba Gump. The wait time for a table was so long OMG my God close to two hours. I have never waited for a table that long in my life. As we leave Bubba Gump my wife tells me; "Oh I forget to give them that free pass I have where you don\'t need to wait in line!" I was like; are you friggin kidding me!!!There was nowhere to sit while waiting and completely packed with people in the waiting area. The waiting area is way too small and crammed they could get rid of the souvenire shop downstairs and expand the waiting area. I guess come at off hours and you will be fine. And if you get annoyed by tourists this is not the place for you. The wait staff ask questions based on Forrest Gump so come prepare and show off!' u"Eons ago my college roommate used to always rant and rave about Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. I always suspected that she was embellishing about the details of how fantastic Bubba Gump's was but I figured since it was nearby and we were hungry I'd give it a try. I regret that we wasted a meal here considering how the food is mediocre.The lines move very quickly here and wait times weren't bad. The physical restaurant is large and able to accommodate very large groups. As one might suspect based on the name the menu is mainly comprised of shrimp dish variations. Unfortunately none of them are incredibly creative. They are exactly like what you'd find at any other seafood restaurant.Our waitress was quirky and quizzed us on the Forest stump movie. There's an annoying sign that you have to flip over if you want a server to stop at your table. At first thought in theory it seems like a cool idea. In reality it becomes a nuisance to have to flip over a sign every time you need something as simple as a refill or extra napkins. After placing our order it only took a few minutes for our food to be served. Once our entrees arrived my husband's had a piece of cellophane plastic sitting in the center of his plate. At first glance we didn't have a clue what it was until another server explained what the lone piece of plastic was sitting crumbled up on the chips. What was really weird was that it was rather large and difficult to miss so its alarming how the kitchen didn't notice or the servers who brought the meals over. Once we brought it to their attention they were very kind and the manager did come over and speak with us. He also made an effort to make things right by deducting the meal from the total bill. Unfortunately the waitress managed to screw this kind gesture up even further by bringing us the total bill and it wasn't until we mentioned our conversation with the manager that she went to get an updated copy. One might be left to conclude that this billing error was intentional. Final conclusion: New York City is filled with restaurants that have some of the best food in the world. Bubba Gumps is a tourist trap with mediocre food. Spare yourself the disappointment and find better food." u"I love Forrest Gump!!!!! I work across the street but I have yet to try this place because it's always packed. They don't take reservations and they always have a long line in the evenings! Starting at like 5:15pm.I finally came for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't busy at all. Walking into the store was so cool all the decorations were exactly like those in the movie. But when I look outside the window and see the busy streets of Time Square and snow it hits me that I had to go back to work:(This place is a little pricy. They don't have a lunch menu. Everything on the menu looked amazing and huge but in reality the food sucked and didn't look appetizing at all. I would say this is a place more for tourists or a one time thing. It was definitely an experience if you're a fan of Forrest Gump but don't have high expectation in the food." u'This is not the Bubba Gump I remember so fondly from Orlando :( Waaah!!!During a family vacay about 10 years ago we dined at another Bubba Gump and it was a freaking fantastic experience. Huge portions dericious food... We all fucking loved it. So when Mother\'s Day rolled around we decided to be reminiscent and check out the Times Sq location. Should\'ve left it a fond memory bc it was such a letdown!The wait was around 30 mins for Mother\'s Day dinner and the hostess was on top of her shit. It has that typical chain charm with a bunch of Forrest Gump memorabilia. Food was okay at best; portions reminded me of Applebee\'s. We had to order another entree to get that "wow I\'m full" feeling. Yes we are a bunch of fatasses. I also ordered a watered down $17 cocktail but I got to take home a mason jar so I guess I ain\'t mad...? But I WILL be mad about the fact that they don\'t give you complimentary bread. With all the damn tourists in this neck of the woods it made the experience that much more unappealing. Goodbye Bubba Gump :(' u"Whilst the Service and food were very good at this place it didn't warrant the price! My wife and I both went for the surf and turf which tasted delicious. But two mains and two of their fancy (soft) drinks where you keep the cup and gratuity our bill came to over $100. Avoid big franchises like these and look around for independent places. You'll get better value for money!" u"My friends and I came here to celebrate a dear friend's birthday. Bubba Gump was her choice and we happily obliged. This was my first time visiting Bubba Gump and I didn't really know the history behind the restaurant name until I entered the restaurant.As soon as I walked through those doors it felt as if I was in a movie. Everything reflected around the Forrest Gump movie. There are two levels to this place on the first level is where you place your place to patiently wait for your name to be called for a table because there are no reservations taken here at this restaurant. There is also a store on the first level that sells practically everything centered around the movie. There are quotes sayings and signs posted throughout the entire store. The wait for a table can be very long or very short depending on the flow of the patrons. The waiting area can get really crowded because it isn't a large waiting area. Okay so our party of three is finally called after waiting for over forty-five minutes for a table.......yippeeeeee! So we proceed to walk upstairs to be seated but no that didn't happen you STILL have to WAIT again to be seated. We were on another line for about 10-15 minutes. Finally we are able to rest our feet and prepare to enjoy our dining experience. We had an AMAZING and FUN server named Mario who was very energetic and friendly. He explained everything that we needed to know to make our dining experience a wonderful one. He suggested menu items to us that we're really good. The food was great.....the only complaint that I had was with the garlic bread not tasting like garlic bread at all. I expressed my concern to Mario who had no problem removing the item from my bill. We sat and talked for at least 45 minutes after we finish eating and not once did anyone asked us to leave which was definitely a plus. Someone who I believe was the manager came over to our table after about 30 minutes and asked if we wanted some more water. Overall my first time was AMAZING and I will definitely come back to dine here and you should too if you haven't dined here yet." u"I had the pleasure of participating in the NY AIDS Walk yesterday (5/15). After 6 miles of walking and swollen feet my friends and I decided to get something to eat. We took the train to Bubba Gump just because 3 of us never had it before. We were seated immediately around 3:30pm and were told about the license plates on the table.Alright so now to the good part the food...I ordered the peel and eat shrimp as an appetizer everyone enjoyed it but I felt like it was lacking a kick. I also ordered the Jambalaya as my entree I tried everyones food and we all agree that I had the best thing. It had the right amount of spice although I am a chili head so I did add pepper sauce but I could've eaten it without. One friend ordered mama blues southern charmed fried shrimp which was good also and he enjoyed everything. The other two ordered the dixie fishwich and they both enjoyed it they said that the fish was fresh but wish it was fried harder because it kept falling apart.Finally we ordered dessert & it was awesome. We ordered the sampler my favorites were the strawberry shortcake biscuit and the bread pudding the chocolate chip cookie would of been great if it was warmer. The bad...My entree was really tiny I expected more for 20.00 to be honest. Also our drinks were watered down or maybe full of too much juice I ordered the peach tea with the souvenir glass but my glass wasn't even new so I didn't take it home. That was disappointing. All in all I would go back again the food was good but the service was better. I only wish I could remember our waiters name." u"One of the nice dining establishments in time square has a great view. The food is filling and has a good zest for flavors ! The Mac and cheese with shrimp leaves you wanting more the tilapia is well seasoned how ever the fruity alcohol drinks needs more alcohol I was better off with the Long Island they were pleasant wait staff accommodating and attentive it truly made the place a memorable experience! They have a loyalty program I'd recommend if you plan to make this a regular spot. Defiantly try the bread pudding I'm looking for the key lime pie next visit" u"The atmosphere of Bubba Gump is very relaxed and comfortable! \xa0I had the stuffed shrimp which at first glance was a small serving size but actually ended up being more than satisfying with portion size. \xa0The seafood hush puppies were great too!The only drawback was the price which was a bit steep for me. \xa0My entr\xe9e was over $20 but the most unreasonable cost was my soda which cost $4.00. \xa0Cost can be overlooked when it's a special occasion and the food was very filing so I would still recommend this place to anyone!" u'Loved the cock tails there! Especially the corona margarita! Loved it! It was quite awesome basically two drinks in one!A shame the food was quite average and pricy. As expected from a chain store. Any how certainly recommend to go have a look if you have never been of if you are a fan of Forest like I am!' u'I went on Friday eve so it was crazy busy. I had dinner on the bar and everyone was so Nice and friendly. I only thought they could do better on offering more grilled/saut\xe9ed fish options. Also for the price you pay to dine the place could be much cleaner or nicer looking.' u"Such a fun atmosphere! \xa0Not as much as its branches in Daytona or Orlando etc. but for NYC it's got the light carefree vibe going on! \xa0I've been quite a few times so I'll list my top 3 items: - Shrimper's Heaven (exactly what the name sounds like) - it's got shrimps done four ways - grilled coconut shrimp tempura and fried. \xa0I swear 90% of the diners order it! - Bucket of Boat Trash - if you're not feeling the fried foods this is a good dish to order for variety and quality! \xa0- Don't judge but I really like the Pear and Berry Salad there - super light and perfect to start off a heavy meal!" u"Yea so there are many other places to go eat around here. \xa0But it's good. If you like shrimp come eat here. It's good. I wasn't in the mood for beer so gad some tequila watermelon drink. Sounds fufu but it was very tasty and refreshing. Also had the shrimp net spicy style. Delicious. Bar staff is prompt and friendly." u'All the employees here were awesome! From the moment I stepped into the place to the point I walked out. Everyone was so friendly and energetic. Music and food is great!' u"If you can put aside that the food will be pretty bad/frozen/reheated and focus solely on experience and service it's really not a bad place.Oddly there's always a wait to get in but that can be alleviated by joining the Landry's Select Club which bolts you straight to the top of the stairs to be seated almost immediately.Every staff member was super excited and pleasant to be around. \xa0They were engaging with the guests and seemed to elicit a pride in working at such a gawdy attraction.The place is wildly expensive easily $20 for a basic entree and $40 for one person dining. \xa0Saving grace is that there's a good chance you leave happy either enjoying the experience of jumping into such a unique piece of Americana or you get sarcastic laughs at the craziness of the totality of the whole experience. \xa0Either way I can't help but return to this place everytime I'm in town. \xa0Perhaps it's the fact that they always have a table for me never a wait for a table and always a friendly server." u'I am a fan of Forrest Gump so eventually I made my way here even though I knew it would be a bit pricey and probably not house the best seafood. it\'s times Square...you\'re going to overpay for food. However it was still a nice experience. There are signs on the table you can flip from "Run Forrest Run" to "Stop Forrest Stop" if you need anything and one of the servers will stop. A much more efficient way to get a refill than waiting for your server or awkwardly trying to flag another one down. \xa0There was a special featuring three of their grilled options (shrimp fish and a skewer of shrimp and veggies) and a combo of fried food. My boyfriend and I got one of each and split in order to not go overboard in calories. Fair warning--most everything here is high in calories. We both preferred the grilled food over the fried food although the French fries had a nice spice on them. \xa0Major con: the waitress asked if we wanted to start off with garlic bread and then we were charged for it. What restaurant offers bread then charges? Either mention it costs money or don\'t offer it. Was a bit ticket off by that.  \xa0Also had the Alabama Brownie which was very rich chocolatey goodness. It\'s not a place you are going to keep well on a diet but every once in a while we need a cheat meal.']
103.Chelsea Grill of Hell’s Kitchen,[u"One of the best boozy brunches I've been to in Manhattan. Came here with my best friend who got us a deal on Pulsd where $35 got us both an entree and unlimited drinks of any kind. ANY KIND. On top of that the food was fantastic. I got the grilled cheese which came with bacon and tomato on it and a side of fries. I requested they put some avocado on it as well and they did at no extra cost! I'm looking at you Chipotle.Our waitress was so nice and very attentive during our entire experience. Loved the atmosphere as well it was a very cute space!" u"I bought a pulsd voucher for an unlimited drink brunch for $35. Went in on Saturday afternoon. The server Christina was great bubbly and very honest about the add ons to the bill she also did not cheat us on the unlimited drinks she kept asking if we wanted another one. Not to mention it was her birthday and she offered us a piece of her cake which was delicious!! The Bellini's were DELICIOUS and they were not watered down totally loved them. I had the twisted grill cheese which was also soo DELICIOUS I could have eaten two! The fries were just ok. We also ordered a steak and eggs which was cooked well but it was a super small steak for the price. Be aware that they add on the tax and tip automatically to the bill so the total bill with voucher was about $60. I would say it was worth it since we had 6 drinks total. However I think the plates are a bit overpriced for what they give you. I would def go back for some bellini's and another twisted grill cheese!" u'Went in for brunch and asked about the drink special... The server reprimanded me for trying to order a mimosa before my boyfriend arrived because otherwise we\'d be in separate checks for the "power hour." I told her I wasn\'t doing the "power hour" and just wanted a mimosa. She slammed one down in front of me peeved. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later he hadn\'t discussed the "special" with me and also asked her the special. \xa0Without looking him in the eyes she rolled her eyes and ran down the details of the special like a child begrudgingly reciting the preamble to the constitution in elementary school. When he ordered just one Bloody Mary he said "Oh I think I was confused by the wording on the sign." She quickly interjected "the wording on the sign ISN\'T confusing!" As she rolled her eyes I just asked for the check for my one mimosa and said we\'d be on our way. She started to walk away and then shouted "You know what?! It\'s on the house!" Perplexed by the entire exchange I walked over to (for some reason) tip her anyway. I said "I\'m not sure what we did to upset you but I\'m sorry." She shouted without looking me in the face "NOTHING. You did nothing." Then she turned to a man at a table behind her (he seemed to work there) and started talking about us. I don\'t know what she said. I guess she\'s used to people being mad about their brunch drink special or something. Weird. Won\'t be back.' u'This place is where dreams go to die. The immediate buyer\'s remorse I had upon booking the $35.00 bottomless brunch coupon on Pulsd should have told me something.Now I\'d like to preface this by saying that as someone who has lived in NYC for six years I should have known better than to book a brunch coupon. They are almost always terrible and this was no exception. Don\'t be like me. Learn from my mistake!Here\'s the rundown:1) \xa0The ambience? Non-existent. Think dive bar meets Hell\'s waiting room. Full of depressed looking tourists and a crusty bartender giving you side-eye as she polishes the same glass over and over again which is funny because all of the glasses and flatware are covered in weird spots. Greasy tables and creaky chairs. Very dark and dingy overall. 2) The food is bad. Like *really* bad. I ordered their version of huevos rancheros which was greasy salty and very poorly plated. Strangely they decided to serve it on a dry hard tortilla shell which was coated with a weird oily film. The chorizo was dry and tasted like what I imagine prison food would be like. My SO had the cornflake-crusted french toast which was also dry and tasteless and generally "missing" something. Both portions were fairly tiny and we ended up ordering a plate of soggy sweet potato fries to fill us up.3) I was hoping that the bottomless drinks would be the redeeming quality of this experience but sadly I was wrong. I started with a vodka soda which unsurprisingly was insipid and watered-down and had weird stuff floating in it. I then tried switching to champagne which was served flat and nearly room temperature. Blech! My boyfriend was smart to stick to Bud Light which was alright. 4) Even though the brunch was supposed to be an hour and 1/2 we decided to leave after just two drinks each. When the server (who was actually very nice) presented us with our check I nearly laughed out loud. With all the extra charges and add-ons this awful "brunch" cost us $67 -- the same amount we would have paid for a real brunch at a superior restaurant. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. It\'s a total ripoff but thankfully I don\'t think it will be long for this world anyway.' u'Was in Hells Kitchen before a show and really fancied a steak. This place was such an unexpected lovely surprise. The staff were nice the decor is average but the FOOD is AMAZING. We got a 10oz steak with blue cheese and drinks and our bill came to under $50 for two of us. What a gem. Really worth checking out.' u'Walked around 9th avenue for a reasonable brunch and decided on this spot. Your regular selection of brunch drinks with many different egg/sandwich dishes (especially for a bar).They have an unlimited drink special for $20 but figured one drink would be sufficient. Got the Eggs Florentine ($13) and a Bloody Mary ($6). The eggs were well made - oozing out the yolk onto a hearty toasted bread. Fries were a bit overdone but went well with the hot sauce provided. The Bloody Mary had a considerable kick - just remember to stir the shit out of it otherwise all the vodka will stay up top.Environment is friendly despite the table next to us sounding like a group of dying hyenas. Will certainly come back for brunch and maybe a regular meal as well.' u"Went here for brunch with a friend with the Pulsd deal (two entrees and unlimited cocktails for 90 minutes for $35).Food was good but not excellent (I ordered an omelet my friend ordered huevos rancheros). Drinks were the same-- but not watered down which I appreciated. The location and atmosphere were nice and the service was very attentive.Overall had a pleasant time but would I come here for brunch without that deal? Don't think so. We received the bill (after my Pulsd reservation/the fact that I had paid already was confirmed) and without the deal it would've come around to $80 for two entrees and total of five drinks. Not worth that in my opinion but if the deal is still going on definitely check this place out." u"I'm a world of bistro hamburgers or Asian fusion as your only options for food (movie trailer voice) there is one more option... Chelsea Grill. Great service. Great steak for under $40. Great beer selection. You're not trying to eat in a crowded bar. Oh and the service is great." u'After being disappointed with my old favourite burger located in West village I had to find a new one. And the Americana from Chelsea Grill is my new fav. Juicy thick meat with a generous crispy bacon and melting cheese on a bed of delicious fries... It fits my definition of a great burger.' u"Even though it doesn't look like much from the outside it is actually quite lovely and a gem of a find. The prices were reasonable and there was a nice variety of dishes on the menu. I was trying to choose between the Cavatelli and Sausage or the Pork Chop -- I asked the waitress her opinion and she was very knowledgeable about the dishes so that was appreciated. I finally decided on the grilled pork chop which was thyme-scented and quite delicious... Tender juicy robust flavor and very rich. I thought that there was a bit too much fat on the pork chop so I would have liked a leaner cut. The pork chop also came with spinach and roasted garlic smashed potatoes. The spinach with sauteed with garlic and tasted okay. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes. I could taste the garlic flavoring and the full fresh flavor of potatoes in each bite. The portion size for this dish was quite good as well. Also the service was pretty good... The waitress was friendly and attentive." u"No longer an HK favorite of mine. The new menu ended everything I had enjoyed. \xa0No more homemade chips. \xa0No more amazing house salad. \xa0No more Chelsea chicken sandwich. \xa0 Just 25 mins for a mediocre turkey burger. \xa050 bucks for below diner quality. \xa0Riposo's unsuccessful little brother doesn't do HK justice." u"Chelsea Grill is NYC's version of Cheers. It's a local watering hole with a welcoming atmosphere and incredible fare. My steak salad was one of the best I've had (wife had the same and agreed) my daughter had the American burger and even though my bite was small it packed a flavorful and rich tasting punch. Well worth a visit if you're looking for solid Americana..." u'I\'ve been here for drinks and karaoke and I have had the best night ever. I walked in randomly with friends because I saw someone from the window singing. I have ever since raved and raved about this spot. it was the middle of my birthday month and I had to mark this off my "birthday list" so I sang about five songs. They also had two regulars who sing karaoke but do Disney songs. I was in heaven. It was almost a dream come true.Until we re-unite again Chelsea Grill.... ahhhhhh :)' u'I LOVE this spot! Super chill atmosphere great for hanging out before a Broadway show or to simply be with friends. Happy hr is 11:30am - 7pm. Apps are $6 and selected drinks are $5-7.The staff is the best!' u"I will start off by saying my friend was robbed here. We were not greeted when we came in and it was empty too. I had to get up to ask for a menu so I thought we didn't have a server and then a server showed up maybe 10 minutes later. She would rather be singing karaoke then tending to her tables from what I saw.By the time we noticed my friend's wallet was missing I notified the server and she didn't have a reaction. I told her to call the police she used her own phone- honestly she should've used the company phone. Then she handed me her phone because she was on hold! ? So I hung up and dialed again and got a response. I will never come back here plus there are no security cameras as well. Then the police told me that on this street people get robbed all the time! So I won't be returning to this area nor this place anytime in the near future." u'Purchased a pulsd voucher for brunch at Chelsea Grill for my boyfriend and I. \xa0Deal came with unlimited breakfast cocktails (mimosas bloody marys etc) and 2 entrees for $35. \xa0Amazing deal! \xa0We both had mimosas. \xa0The wait staff was great and kept those mimosas coming. \xa0For our entrees I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was delicious. \xa0The presentation was also great and really eye-catching. \xa0My boyfriend got the burger and was very happy with how it was cooked. \xa0Love that they open the front garage door-style window up to bring on nice days to bring in the cool air and sun. \xa0Great place' u'I went in with no expectations and wasn\'t totally thrilled. The food was pretty bland. Pretending I was on a "cheat day" I had the chicken sandwich fries and tried the fried pickles. It was just aight. The reviews suggest wings are your best bet here. The service was ok but a bit slow. The general area is loud but spacious enough for a table for 2 or 6. It\'s worth a try but once was enough for me.' u"I don't know how the food is because I have been sitting here for an hour waiting for my omelette. Ridiculous! Service sucks. Don't come here unless you have several hours to eat.Update: Our food finally came. The breakfast potatoes were hard as a rock the omelette was flavorless they lied about the syrup being real maple syrup and my friends grilled cheese was burnt. All bad." u"Arrived in the city and needed to get some lunch. Strolled 9th Ave where there are many options. Saw the specials board on the sidewalk at Chelsea Grill and decided they looked interesting. Few customers there so service was quick but I'd expect it to be as prompt as prompt anytime based on the attitude of those working. I had the Buffalo Chicken panini. Recommended! Mild sauce so it would be fine for those who don't like it hot. Generous serving of chicken in the panini! Fries accompanied. Only concern was it was impossible to eat as a sandwich -- the chicken kept squeezing out of the sandwich because of bleu cheese dressing \xa0and spinach. But no problem. Take chicken out. Use a knife and fork. Reasonable price. Good food. Nice atmosphere. Quiet away from crowds of Broadway/Times Square. Yeah I'd go back!" u"Purchased groupon for brunch. I would give it less stars but the server was very nice. I ordered eggs benedict and the bun was completely burned down like black color completely... Really??... You didn't see it is that much burned?... It's awful.. Not worse it at all.."]
15.Totto Ramen,[u"As was promised in the previous review I decided to eat at Totto Ramen again during a more recent trip to New York. This time around I realized that there are actually multiple Totto Ramen locations and that the previous review I left on this page was not actually for this location. I also realized that I may or may not have glorified the Totto Ramen experience in my memory while writing the previous review just because the food was so delicious.At 7:30 PM on a Saturday night the wait was about half an hour. The facility is small and was very crowded and the air conditioner doesn't do a particularly good job of cooling the place down since the stoves are pretty much three meters away from the dining area. Add a relatively humid summer day and some extra spicy ramen and you get an extremely sweaty experience.Service wasn't particularly impressive. Most of the waiters and waitresses seemed very busy and we couldn't really tell which waiter or waitress was serving our table until the bill was brought out.As I did last time however I will probably forget about the sweat and the environment with time and instead only remember the impression that the food had on me. The ramen is delicious. The broth is heavy but savory and uniquely flavorful and the noodles are firm and chewy. The spiciness adds to the flavor and is easily adjustable since the oil comes in a separate container and the toppings (eggs bean sprouts etc.) complement the ramen perfectly.Overall I still believe that Totto Ramen is one of the best ramen places that I've ever been to. It's an experience that I wouldn't mind having again during a future visit to New York." u"Using my husband's Yelp account since I don't have one.I felt completely disrespected when I was eating here today. I came here with 3 friends and we got our food within 2 minutes after we sat down. In the next 10-15minutes a waitress came over two times asking us if we were done with our ramen. After she removed their bowls during those visits she came back with our check as I was still trying to finish my ramen. Then very soon after as I turned around to grab my wallet a waitress walked over reached out her hand to my bowl asking me if I was done I quickly responded that no I am not done yet. Then I thought to myself hey I better hurry up...(I seriously think that I have my right to enjoy my food the food that I am going to pay for.) I resumed eating and then at one point I just paused eating for a second the same waitress came back reaching her hand out again and asking me again whether I was done. This time I held my hand up and said no I am not done I am not done yet. No I don't think I will ever go back there again giving the fact that it is impossible to enjoy the food. I feel disrespected and I don't have to put myself through something like that. The whole meal was probably less than 30 minutes and being interrupted 4 times was more than reasonable." u'Too Low A/C in this weather :(Ramens were good overall but the noodles were a little uncooked. Beef coroquette was just nothing special. Asahi draft beer were served with good temperture. There are so many new Ramen restaurants opening in Manhattan and Totto is losing their compete I guess.' u"Totto Ramen was everything years ago. Now there are more ramen shops around and though they're not everything now they're still consistently great. I'm used to this location when I visit the big apple and it's still my preference of ramen compared to popular places such as Ippudo in the city. Unlike Ippudo the interior of Totto Ramen is no frills. It's a small space with four tables and the bar with a tiny bathroom where you do all your business standing in the exact same spot. This place comes close to ramen shops in Japan. Totto Ramen is quite efficient. Though the lines aren't as crazy as they were years ago you still have to put your name on the list and wait. They will call your party ahead of time to take your orders so when you get seated your food is ready. I've tried almost every ramen here and I can say the broth al dente noodles and perfectly charred pork make their bowls quality. What makes this place stick out more for me is their vegetable ramen. It comes in regular and spicy options and both broths are so flavorful that you wouldn't miss the meat." u'I decided to stop by for a late night dinner after a broadway. This place is always packed due to the high demand. The line was long but I decided to wait. It was a bit unorganized but the host did her best to accommodate everyone. She did a terrific job noting that it was almost midnight. I waited for almost 30 minutes before getting a bar seat. It was hot and muggy inside but I didn\'t mind since I was sitting right by the 2 huge pots of ramen broth. The ramen was more on the greasy side which was hard to eat. I tried my best to finish it but couldn\'t. The portions of meat are huge I couldn\'t finish that either. I kinda felt sick after eating it since I consumed so much grease. Overall it was an A-OK experience. Nothing to say "I need to go back".' u'Food: 3.5/5.0Service: 3.0/5.0Value: 3.0/5.0Decor: 3.0/5.0Overall: 3.5/5.0 Not a lot of square footage here with a funky chicken ramen. \xa0Quality of the ramen here is meh/decent which should be surprising given lines and popularity of the chain. \xa0This is probably average to slightly above in the city.' u'So I was really going to give five stars to this place but that was before I received the check. This was dedinitely the most expensive ramen I ever ate!! I went there today with my boyfriend I took the 1st ramen on the list (paitan with pork) and he took the "mega". Mine was annouced to be 10$ on the menu and I added two toppings so it was supposed to be 14$ in total my boyfriend\'s was supposed to be 16$ and he took a beer with that 6$. The "funny" thing is that somehow with the taxes and the 20% gratuity the waiter tells you to add (yep didn\'t really gave us any choice here) we ended up paying 53$ for two ramen and a beer..!The ramen was good (even tho my boyfriend was actually really disappointed with his with all its garlic and onions it was jusr too much) and the service was ok but the price is definitely way too high for what it is.Also while we were eating at the bar we both saw one of the guys preparing the ramens wiping the sweat of his forehead with his gloves... Which was kind of gross.' u"The Ramen is good but this place is like a fast assembly-line. They get you in and out quick. Herding humans into shared tables packing them in really tight and getting you out nice and quick so someone else can take over your spot these guys knows they are popular right now!The bubbling broth is cooked and large pots and the staff here works hard to keep it moving. You will pay for it too. They know you're coming so they will charge you. Get your cash ready! I ordered the spicy bowl which was so hot for me especially on a summer day! I like the sweat though; i'm a person comfortable with eating very spicy food. Somehow however this was just hot with not so exciting flavor.Would I return? No. But try it if you want. You'll be in and out in less than 25 minutes." u"Expect to wait outside. But they'll take your order as you wait and once seated service is prompt. We were seated for a couple minutes when our bowls arrived.Miso paitan | tender flavorful delicious char-sui. Heavy broth but not as heavy as pork-based broths. I think all their bowls are chicken-based broths. Noodles were a perfect consistency. The egg was unfortunately overcooked but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that. Don't order the spicy bamboo. Just bamboo covered in Japanese pepper mix. Overall decent ramen but not my favorite in New York. Would come back if friends wanted to try it and in the neighborhood. Otherwise prob wouldn't come back on my own." u"Best ramen in NYC? YES! (In my opinion) of all the other ramen places I've tried in the city totto makes the best. They excel in flavor texture and quality of their ramen. But then again can we really compare totto to other places ? Maybe. They are unique in that the broth they use is thick and not thin like other ramen places. And it has a unique texture/flavor that is super rich and savory. The restaurant itself is very tiny and clustered. If you come for dinner be prepared to wait. But it's worth it. The wait staff is smart; when it's about time for you to sit they will let you order ahead of time so that when you are seated you can be served right away. Smart and efficient so that they can keep the lines moving. Get in eat and get out. This time I ordered the Mega ramen bowel ($16). It was awesome ! Thick pork broth wavy noodles char sieu pork belly shredded pork daikon radish bean sprouts and scallions. Hands done best ramen I've ever had.it is so rich and the flavors are sooo good. You will not be disappointed with the food here. The noodles are perfect texture not too hard or soft. The meats are melt in your mouth. Each he'd behind the bar is responsible for one thing either Cook noodles  cooke meat or cool broth. They are masters of each craft which is why the ramen here is so good.I would come here again and again even if the wait can be an hour." u"Best ramen in NYC!Totto is a super small hole in the wall ramen joint. Do not come with a big group because your wait will be long and you probably will not sit with each other. They open at 5:30 for dinner and the wait was already an hour plus at that time.Food comes out pretty fast. Super fast paced.Spicy Paitan - $12 - This is the only ramen I crave for. The spice with the white chicken broth perfect! Pork char siu was good and the other toppings are pretty standard. The broth is what makes this so good! If it came with an egg it would have been magical. This ramen blows Ippudo's out of the park!Miso Paitan - $12 - Very salty when you mix the miso with the broth. I had to dilute it with water to cut the saltiness. Good toppings happy it came with an egg.Char Siu Pork Bun 2 - $6 - Pork belly was not tender and did not melt in my mouth. Not cooked long enough and did not have that sear that gives it that sweet caramelization. Ippudo's buns destroy this. 5 stars because I am craving that spicy ramen right now!" u"Totto was our first ramen venture while visiting the awesome city of NYC. We were on our feet all day walking all over town and got hungry and this was on the list to have for dinner. Definitely Totto is the best ramen I ever had. My boyfriend also agreed and didn't want to eat at any other ramen places back in Georgia. After trying Totto I knew it would be hard to settle for the other places when we got home. We approached the place expecting a wait time of an hour. However to our surprise we got seated immediately. The way we ordered was kind of weird to be honest. They had us sit on the side (which is very cramped) opposite of the dining bar to place our orders. We thought we were going to sit there and eat our bowls of ramen. After we ordered they walked us over to the bar area where we sat and watched the ramen chefs put together everyone's bowls. I don't know how they do it because the heat is strong at this restaurant. Now if it was winter I wouldn't have felt so bad. But this summer heat in the city was pretty intense and to be in the hot steaming kitchen all day-I can't imagine. The following was ordered:Miso Paitan: All 4 of us ordered this and I requested it to be super spicy. That was a huge mistake on my part and I didn't regret it but I couldn't finish a little less than half. The broth was so good though I chose to add toppings of bamboo shoots and ordered extra chashu. Pork Buns: The pork buns are always a must get when visiting ramen spots for the first time these were good. Overall I really enjoyed the experience here. The place may be a bit cramped but getting to watch them make the bowls of ramen is fun. I love noodles in general so any ramen spots that come up-I must try. Definitely coming here during my next trip to this city." u"The fianc\xe9e and I took my niece here while she was doing a ballet intensive nearby. She loves ramen and since she was visiting I wanted to take her to my favorite: Ippudo West. Called ahead to hear a 1-hr wait. \xa0The three of us all had rumblin' tummies and an hour wait wouldn't do.Walking down Columbus I called Totto and they estimated a 15-minute wait!(!) WAITING: It's a pretty organized and efficient system: you wait outside and the hostess gives you a menu to look at. Ponder decide order and wait. As people got seated the hostess directed us to move closer and closer to the entrance until we were on this bench by the opening.(!) WHAT WE GOT: I got the miso paitan ($12); fianc\xe9e got the spicy miso paitan ($12); and my niece got the yuuuuge (hehe) mega paitan ($16). (!) HOW IT DID: I can really only speak for mine and say that it was really good! Ramen to me isn't really meant for summer evenings and there's something to be said about how a winter night in New York can enhance a bowl... but y'know this was good. I honestly can't say it was the best I've ever had but it was satisfying.(!) HOW IT DID... IN DETAIL: The pork was nice and fatty not the best I've had in my life but it still complemented the broth and noodles. While I'm usually a big fan of poached egg the soft boiled was spectacular and gave some of the best bites. Noodles seemed a tad bit harder but satisfying. I ordered garlic paste for mine and well I think I could've done without it. Fianc\xe9e's bowl the spicy miso paitan however was way too peppery -- like (I know this isn't why) but it's as if you put too much ground pepper in your food. The peppery taste overpowered the ramen.... and this I'm not so sure about. It just seemed... off for an establishment like Totto to have something that tasted like this.(!) PAYMENT: CASH ONLY credit-card heads. I saw a Citibank and Chase on our walk south on Columbus from Lincoln Center.... and there's a 7/11 nearby. For those of you that throw caution to the wind and live life on the edge the ATM at the burger place next door has a $2.99 surcharge.(!) SERVICE & UMBEYONCE: There's also something to be said about the service; from start to finish they always had a smile. And the ambiance oh man they beat Club Ippudo (that untz untz untz music) by a mile. It brought me back to my favorite back in California Shin-Sen-Gumi... a tiny spot where you're either back to back or on the bar... That's how to do it!(!) TIDBITS: After everything y'know I'd go back. Especially for the price. The ramen was good and while I was a bit thrown off by the spicy miso (especially because no one's said anything about the peppery bit...) \xa0I'd be down to give it another chance. Keep in mind you can't do take-out or to go so if you have leftovers sorry! Order accordingly!" u'A small ramen shop to really give you that authentic ambiance. Grab a seat by the bar and watch your order be prepared right in front of you. I highly recommend the pork buns here; they are tender and flavorful. The ramen is just as impressive. This location is pretty small I would anticipate a wait although it usually is not that long. They don"t want customefs blocking the sidewalk so don\'t be surprised if you get shuffled into a neighboring stairwell. Highly recommended would love to be back.' u"I'm liking these hole in the wall type of restaurants.Came here starving for a late lunch around 2:30 with a friend and of course ramen was an excellent choice to satisfy our stomachs. Walked down to a below ground shop and we were greeted and seated immediately. They offer table seating and bar seating so we chose seats at the bar which allows you to watch the chefs prepare everything. By the way try not to sit near the broth pots; the heat there is just uncomfortable to be near.I ordered the pork paitan ramen ($10) w/ soft boiled egg (+$1) + corn (+$1) and shared a broiled char siu pork ($6) with my friend.I literally saw them torch the pieces of pork right in front of me. Looks and tasted great! Very soft and tender. The ramen came out afterwards and that tasted great as well. Not a huge fan of chopped onions in my ramen though. I could definitely taste the chicken broth flavor in the soup but it was more a saturated chicken noodle soup kind of taste.I would come back." u'Totto was hands down the best ramen I had and the one ramen shop I was most looking forward to trying. This place is a hole in the wall and has limited seating. We were seated at the bar and had the pleasure of watching the cooks make our ramen. Keep in mind the bar seating area was extremely hot because all the ramen broth is being cooked right in front of you. \xa0I ordered the Mega Paitan w/ a soft boiled egg. It comes with three different kinds of meat pork belly pork chashu pulled pork and each one was so succulent and soft. The broth is super flavorful and the noodles are thick and chewy. Extremely large portion size and worth every penny! All the flavors went very well together and I especially liked the garlic flavor. They take our order outside while we are waiting so the amount of time spent sitting in the restaurant was actually pretty minimal. CASH ONLY.' u"It was my first night in New York City of my trip and my friend and I were deciding what to eat...at around 9PM hahaLuckily Totto Ramen and Ippudo Ramen were nearby in Hell's Kitchen so we decided to check out the waiting times for both places. Since Ippudo was crazy packed and the wait was hella long we ended up going to Totto Ramen because the wait wasn't too bad and we were too lazy to go and find somewhere else to eat LOL It's a really small and cramped inside so if you are claustrophobic then this ramen place may not be the place for you haha. The vibe inside almost reminds me of being in Asia/Japan with all the decorations and it's so loud/noisy inside but it almost feels like home.We ordered the Broiled Char Siu Pork as appetizer and 2 bowls of the Chicken Paitan (which has the Chicken Paitan Soup broth topped with scallions onions nori char siu and pulled char siu - either pork or chicken). My friend and I were extremely curious to try chicken ramen since that's something that is not served or common here in Southern California but we were adventurous and went for it! Oh btw cash only!The Broiled Char Siu Pork turned out to be amazing. Since I'm a big fan of everything pork belly and I was extremely hungry at the time it was an instant hit in my mouth LOL. As for the chicken ramen surprisingly it turned out quite delicious as well! It wasn't salty at all. I would say it's definitely a healthier option/substitute than your usual heavy salty pork ramen broth. When I finished I didn't feel so bloated afterwards since it was kinda late...so I was pleased by that. It was a quite unique experience for my friend and me. We both agreed that we still love and crave our salty pork ramen broth back in Southern California but this chicken ramen was a good substitute. Thanks for the fun experience! Glad to say that I have officially tried chicken ramen :)" u"The short: flavorful ramen with salty soupOk before I get any virtual staredowns because of a 3-star review on a popular well-established place let me explain. This is a really random hole-in the wall place in what seems like a neighborhood for residents not a popular ramen spot. I came here just before 4 on a Wednesday and was seated immediately at the bar. Score to no wait and fast service. The stools are fixed to the ground and I couldn't find a hook to place my bag so I placed it on my lap hoping that I wouldn't spill anything on it (thankfully I didn't). The menu is very simple and I didn't want to waste any time so I picked the mega paitan. Little did I know that this was a special dish in an extra large red bowl. As I was waiting for the food (a quick 5 minutes) I remarked how small the place is probably seating 10 at the bar and 10 at tables. Their rooster logo is so cute. Wow they have vats of broth cooking. Oh cool the guy is actually taste testing the soup. Hmmm let's watch this guy make this bowl (turns out it was mine haha). I dug in and the verdict? Delicious tender and chewy noodles with lots of meat pieces to choose from. However the soup was so salty! (the reason for the 3 star). I was later remarking how salty it was to a local New Yorker and they agreed that things are more salty than people are typically used to. I still enjoyed the broth but had to keep drinking lots of water (with prompt refills from the waiters) because of how thirsty I got. The char siu was too dry for my taste though I did enjoy the pork belly (my favorite).Towards the end of the meal I relaxed and noticed that one of the chefs uses one of those flame torches to grill the meat. So interesting. At the end I realized that they took full advantage of the space they had here. Half of the space is devoted to eating and half of it is for the kitchen. Even the bathroom maximized the space. Next time I'm in the city I'll be checking out other ramen hot spots to determine which I like the best!Sidenote: cash only" u"Totto was top on my list of ramen places to stop at during my trip in New York. It did not disappoint and my group of friends agreed the ramen we had here was one of the best we've had. I personally liked it much better than Ippudo. I think a lot has to do with the fact that Totto seems to be a more authentic hole in the wall where the chefs all spoke Japanese whereas Ippudo seemed quite commercialized. I ordered the spicy paitan ramen with pork and added a soft boiled egg. The broth had the perfect kick of spicy and was very flavorful. The noodles were thin and complimented the soup well. If you like chewy thicker noodles then get the mega paitan since the noodles are different. The egg was good and pork was good too although I've had more tender.It was a good amount of food and very filling. The wait isn't too bad but do note that they have a very strict policy where all members of the party have to be present. Also cash only." u"I can't go on enough about this place. Coming in I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the hype (I've heard it gets super busy and it was recommended by a number of my friends) but it definitely did. There was no wait when we came in about 15 minutes after opening and we sat facing the open kitchen so we could watch them cook. The service was really friendly (although I did wait a while for a refill on water) and our food came out really fast after ordering. To be completely honest I wasn't even in the mood for ramen when we stopped in. I got the Pork Miso Paitan and it was absolutely phenomenal. My boyfriend ordered the Mega Paitan which has 3 different kinds of pork. They were all great. Everything was so good. The broth was delicious the perfect miso broth and the pork was so good. The noodles were exactly al dente but that's how I like them. I hope to be back many more times-- we both left almost too full to walk. The only downside to coming here is the cash only we made do. Love love love."]
190.Medi Winebar,[u"Brunch was amazing! The baked egg dish with tomatoes was one of the best brunch dishes I've ever had. Be warned that the prices on the website are lower than the actual menu prices. Quit being greedy and raising your prices so much." u'Went here for lunch. Was extremely disappointed.... food was bland menu online was less expensive than the menu at the resturant. On another sour note the bathroom facilities are less than ideal requiring the user to affix the door handle upon entry and exit of the facilities. \xa0-Bad date spot. -nice outside garden' u"After some hits here the misses have finally won out. This place has become completely skippable. If you can't grab a table outside in the back (don't take one out front - you'll die from car exhaust) go somewhere else. The brunch is ok...there's plenty to drink and some ok dishes. But nothing really that good. My most recent visit here topped the $100 mark very quickly with just a mediocre bottle of their cheapest red wine some olives that could've been off the cold bar at a grocery store terrible Calamari Bruschetta with what seemed like dried Prego smeared over too much bread and chewy/cold squid and over-cooked lamb balls on pita. Sad to say that this place's best days are in the past. I'd highly recommend spending your hard earned money elsewhere." u'This place screams "chick place". \xa0Small servings of blah blah food for lots of money. \xa0We were a group of six for lunch and we\'re actually wanting to eat at Annabels but it wasn\'t open. \xa0So we decided to try Medi next door since we were starving. \xa0We had nothing but small sandwiches and salads and one of our party had a glass of wine. \xa0The bill was $114. So not worth it in my book. \xa0The food quality was decent but nothing special. Especially at those prices.' u"Came back again on Saturday night with 8. We had a great time. Good service our server kept the drinks flowing. We tried a bunch of different cocktails from the menu but The Best & Medi were definitely the most popular. We didn't feel rushed at all. It got busy for dinner so reservations are recommended especially on weekends. We had several appetizers: Chef's cheese & meats platters Grilled Portuguese Octopus (perfectly cooked) Rice croquettes Bone marrow Burrata (really good) Ceviche (average). Main courses on the table were Couscous Casserole (really good) Risotto special (very good) special fish & a few other items. Everything was good & we were all quite happy with our meal.The menu has more choices in appetizers/tapas than main courses and you won't see a lot of the traditional Mediterranean dishes on the menu....I would say it's more fusion. But overall a nice place with a lovely Cellar room & backyard dining as well." u"Honestly I chose this place for the bonus opentable points. Came here for late lunch (2pm) and the restaurant was still pretty full. I loved the atmosphere when I first walked in- the windows were decorated with airy curtains and the wood tables in the middle of the restaurant were placed at an angle so it didn't feel rigid. Every table was also decorated with fresh tulips. My friend was really hungry and went with the steak and eggs ($22) while I went for the eggs Benedict with salmon ($18) we also got a side of Gruyere cheese ($5). The menu was a little misleading because we thought it would include all 4 cheeses listed but the waitress told us it's $5 for each type. Steak and eggs - what a measly portion. There were literally 5 pieces of thinly cut steak eggs and a giant bed of arugula. For $22 it was definitely not worth a burger would've been more filling. Eggs Benedict w/ salmon - this was super yummy and the eggs were poached nicely. The sauce was creamy but not overwhelming. It also came with a huge portion of arugula salad. Gruyere cheese - I don't know how long it was aged but we both enjoyed it no complaints.Overall the experience here was okay we were just really put off by how small the steak and eggs portion was. *They have bottomless brunch here" u"My go to place for light fare in Hell's Kitchen. \xa0Try the downstairs it is much more intimate." u'I absolutely love love love this restaurant. The ambiance is cute romantic but not pretentious (perfect for a date!). The service is good but most importantly the food is DELICIOUS perfectly seasoned and spiced and not too heavy. My favorite dish here is the grilled Portuguese Octopus..amazing and fresh similar to what I had when I visited Portugal. \xa0I would also recommend the Pappardelle "Al Limone" a fresh and light pasta dish with lemon basil cheese and almond. I\'ve also had the meats and cheeses hummus lamb kofte seafood couscous bone marrow and a bunch of other dishes and have not been disappointed. Recommend this 100% -- I keep coming back!' u"When in doubt Medi. Medi is my go to in Hell's Kitchen for brunch (especially with the great prices on pitchers of boozy brunch drinks). The food is consistently good the service is always good and it's fairly easy to make a reservation. In the summer you can sit outside in their garden but the main dining room is also sun-filled and delightful.My favorite dish is the Shakshouka - it's hot both temperature wise and spice-level wise and I usually use an entire basket of bread to soak up the tomato sauce - no shame. The baked eggs with sausage mushroom cream and gruyere is also a favorite - super rich and creamy and perfect. For ultimate fatty status I recommend the homemade brioche stuffed with nutella - you won't regret it (or you will but it's okay).Dinner at Medi is also a solid choice - with plenty of Mediterranean/Italian dishes as well as good cocktails. Medi is totally underrated and definitely a great option in HK!" u"I've gone here during the summers for the past two years while I visit and have loved it every time. \xa0Always unique food options and great service. \xa0I always sit outside as they have a few picnic tables lined up along the restaurant. \xa0No separation with planters between walkers or tables but it is not crowded. \xa0Last year they had the most amazing bacon wrapped dates with goat cheese as one of their small plates... which I was sad they didn't have again this year. \xa0But instead this year they had fried artichokes and a calamari brushetta that was amazing! Love the tapas idea as I can order a lot of plates for our group and try a little of everything. \xa0This is a sure bet for us every year." u'Came here for brunch with the girlfriend. \xa0Fantastic seating in the garden and great food. \xa0Very untraditional food options for brunch but we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. \xa0She wont\'t stop asking me "when are we going back?!"' u"Overpriced Americanized quasi-Mediterranean/Greek food you might expect to pay $9.99 for at the local Olive Garden. The wine was even more inflated. Service was something like Leonardo DiCaprio's Jay Gatsby had he worked in the service sector. The atmosphere was comfortable and inviting however and perhaps with more reasonable prices and a different server things may have gone differently. My biggest complaint is the pasta I ordered. I had expected something light and tart. The Parmesan was heavy and piled on a la American style and sat in my stomach like a baseball. \xa0A fist in the stomach after a few oysters and a light salad. Just a bland not great evening that would have deserved another star had the prices been more in line with (my perception) of the quality of food. What I appreciated was the eclectic variety of diners. \xa0There were the Chelsea gays with their style and poise the straight couple out for a romantic evening and families sharing a special meal together. \xa0Kudos for the excellent atmosphere and ambiance." u"I went here for brunch. \xa0It is a great boozy brunch deal. You order an entree and order as many pictures of mimosas and bloody Mary's you want for a set price. \xa0My omelette was great." u"I held my birthday party in the basement and it was great. The ambiance is very nice great decor and cute layout. It's a very nice area to host a party - and the appetizers were great. The main entrees were generally good but the chicken was terrible only downside to that evening. The wine was great and service was excellent. Super cute place to host a party and have fun." u"If I could give no stars I would. Never experienced a more rude manager unwilling to accommodate a request for a garden table with our reservation because of the disruptive food festival on 9th Ave. Considering the restaurant was empty with a plethora of reservations available that night this guy has no concept of customer service or business. We won't return." u"Awesome spot! Fabulous food and great atmosphere inside as well as an outside garden area. Had the mixed seafood with couscous dish and it was wonderful. They were closing the patio around 11 but let us stay there until closing and were accommodating in moving us inside or the outside area in front of the restaurant to finish our meal. Would def recommend for a friend or date spot in Hell's Kitchen." u'$60 dollar brunch for two with no drinks... and it was AWFUL. I gave them a one star because ZERO was not an option.First I wanted french toast the menu said "maple syrup" but still I specifically asked the server if there was real maple syrup. The kitchen said "yes" so I ordered.What arrived was a watery maple flavored corn syrup.I told the manager and he looked at me with disdain. "THAT is maple syrup." (I guess the customer isn\'t always right at MEDI) I asked to see the bottle and they brought forth a plastic jug clearly labled Pancake Syrup with the key ingredient being corn syrup.I next ordered a MEDI omelet. A cooked scrambled eggs disk wrapped around COLD pre-cooked spinich onions feta and tomatoes arrived.Too hungry to send it back I ate the egg portion.Save yourself the trouble. The restaurant next door looked pretty good. LOL MEDI is short for MEDIOCRE.' u"One of my new favorite spots in NYC the two chefs are amazing and they use the freshest of ingredients. I trust their judgement and will never ask them to modify a dish again! (Also because they won't ). The Greek Salad is incredible as are the Eggs Benedict and Two Baked Eggs (on the brunch menu). Also the Steak and Chicken Sandwich the Panna cotta... Everything is so good. The wine selection is also fantastic I'm a fan of their Bordeaux with the label Pentimento. The vibe is casual and relaxed with a European feel. There is also a small patio in the back for summer dinning.The staff is also great and our regular waiter was always accommodating. I highly recommend this place.I went back recently and neither of the two chefs Luca and Andre were working that day. I asked to make certain but it was obvious in the preparation and taste of the food. This would explain the mixed reviews." u'Nice ambiance but I expected a lot better. The place leaves a lot to be desired.The buratta appetizer was really good and I enjoyed my blackberry cocktail. However dinner was very underwhelming.My boyfriend ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli and I got the papardelle "al limone." I enjoyed my papardelle but the $12-13+ we paid for his four ravioli was definitely not worth the price. The menu specifically noted that all pasta was made "fresh" but we both saw bags of frozen ravioli being unloaded in the kitchen as we ate our appetizers. The details everywhere else in the restaurant are so nice that it was a shame to see that and you could definitely tell that they were frozen.The server seemed nice but was a little clueless. When she asked how our dinner was going and my boyfriend mentioned that it was generally okay but that he was disappointed she said that she was glad to hear it and carried on without inquiring as to why. I won\'t be returning.' u"This place has such a cute garden in the back. Totally unexpected and takes you away from the hectic NYC life. I'm not sure if it's because I ate outdoors under the sun but I didn't feel too good after this meal. The homemade meatballs were good. The croquettes were good. The fish sandwich - good at the first bite but then I realized how greasy it was. Overall it's a cute place but I'll need to try it again indoors with its rustic theme."]
148.China Xiang,[u"My roommate and I have been curious about this place ever since moving into Hell's Kitchen - such a shabby exterior but always so so packed.Our opinion changed completely after we decided to give it a try. Stepping into the restaurant we were met with a beautiful + clear interior design. It was PACKED - tons of big groups + small groups enjoying asian food and wine/beer.We ordered the General Tso Chicken + cucumber (starter). Also had wine!The food tasted really really good. Overall the prices are definitely a tad bit high (but considering it is Hell's Kitchen/Times Square I guess that's what you get). But definitely SO different than what we expected just judging it by the look of the restaurant from the street!Really want to try other dishes on the menu - namely the Kung Pao Chicken and Sesame Chicken dishes." u"This place is getting popular! \xa0Well their food is really good. Most of the Chinese restaurants in NYC serve Americanized Chinese food \xa0not good. \xa0But this restaurant serve pretty authentic Chinese (Hunan) food. \xa0My and most of my friends' favorite are Hunan Mifen. \xa0Also \xa0their staffs are very friendly and nice. I will keep coming back as long as they are here.To the owner \xa0please do keep the quality of your food and service!!" u'Came here expecting it to be a bit over the top touristy and was pleasantly surprised. Located near Times Square for those who may be trying to catch a quick meal before a play or see some of the sights. The staff was attentive food was tasty and the portions were a decent size. It was a little expensive for Chinese but worth it given the location. The Dan Dan Noodles were well-flavored and the pork soup dumplings were also very good.' u'Good stuff seemed authentic too. I had the dan dan spicy peanut chili noodles which are usually cold but warm here and were super tasty and had some heat the fried spring rolls which were fine and then finished with the hot soup dim sum dumplings which were worth the wait. Good service also.' u"I found this place to be pretty bland and not what I expected from a place with 'szechuan' on the sign outside. \xa0I doubt the chefs are authentic.The Dan Dan noodles weren't very spicy and weren't even made with the signature spicy red chili oil that make them so delicious. \xa0Instead they were served in a sort of brown gravy-esque sauce that didn't seem remotely szechuan. \xa0Would not recommend.The Mapo Tofu was also disappointing. \xa0It's another szechuan staple that they serve which didn't actually have much szechuan flavor to me. \xa0The tofu was uninspiring and textureless and the sauce was simply not very hot - barely registered to me. \xa0Some of the other dishes seemed to be pretty americanized.Overall would not recommend this place. \xa0There have to be better chinese and szechuan options nearby." u"Went to this place because read some article that they offer traditional Hunan rice noodle. So we tried two rice noodle dish. One person in my group whose hometown is Hunan says the taste was okay but it's not authentic. Also ordered sticky with pork ribs as it seems popular. The pork ribs were tasteless and there were only few pieces hidden under the rice. Japanese bonito flakes doesn't go well with sticky rice - do not recommend." u"I ordered for delivery based on the shining reviews because in this day in age if you didn't let strangers convince you what to have for dinner did you even eat dinner? The answer is no.Needless to say based on the 2 stars I was really disappointed.I don't know what I ate but I know it wasn't the Kung Pao Chicken that I thought I was ordering. And let me add a disclaimer to that I only know kung pao chicken by my American standards however anywhere that I get it it always contains the following:Diced chicken Chili peppersPeanutsScallions My smiling faceBam. Kung pao chicken. What I got in addition to the ingredients listed above minus the chili peppers scallions and my smiling face had celery carrots water chestnuts and sliced red bell pepper. What? I was confused. It tasted okay but I was definitely confused. Maybe there's another region of Asia that makes it this way and therefore they are correct but I don't want to eat in that region. I want to eat the dish that makes me want to cry because it's so spicy due to all the chili peppers. I want to eat the dish that has so many peanuts in it I think I'm on an airplane.Okay that's a bit extreme but you catch my drift. It wasn't Kung Pao Chicken. Plain and simple. It tasted more equivalent to a prepackaged bag of stir fry chicken that you'd find at the grocery store with a bag of Birds Eye frozen vegetables mixed in. Dare I say it even tasted a little... sweet?I also got an order of scallion pancakes that tasted like straight phyllo dough. It was just... I have no words.Silly American with no authentic Asian experience aside I have had my fair share of take out around the city and this was just a mess.I'm giving two stars because whatever that experiment of a chicken dish was it was still edible. And also because the delivery guy was really nice.Deuces." u"With my friend's recommendation I was so exited to try out this newly decorated Chinese restaurant but it was not good at all. The service was poor and the food here was just average.We even got one jar of ROTTEN braised chicken feet. Ewww..... Taste like the feet were left decades ago. The other six dishes we ordered were OK. The Saut\xe9ed sour string beans with minced pork was TASTY and the rice noodle was ok. The most unacceptable thing was the service here. We waited for almost 40 minutes for our ROTTEN chicken feet when we finished the other six dishes. What's more when we asked manager to took back the dish the manager told us the restaurant always served people with fresh food and she was the one saw the chef marinated fresh chicken feet. OMG really?! She gave us a new one but the feet just taste the same. Disappointed!Even though we got some discount for the bill I don't recommend this restaurant." u"After purchasing a Yelp deal for Fuji Sushi I arrived at the address to find that Fuji Sushi no longer existed. In its place was China Xiang where the waiters did not speak enough English to explain that the Yelp deal was still valid even though the name and cuisine of the restaurant no longer matched up. So anyway I was still able to use the deal so if any of you want to buy the Fuji Sushi deal be informed that it works here. You just may have to struggle through some translation issues.Now to the food itself - they stipulate that there is no tipping hence very high prices. The presentation of the food is very nice for a Chinese restaurant and it is quite tasty. However I still don't think that the price would be worth it even considering the tip factored in hence the three stars- Especially considering Ollie's is steps away and equivalent if not better in taste." u"Very good food. It's not big portion as it's near Time Square. But it's really good food. The decoration is nice too. I recommend this place." u"Terrible restaurant. Ordered the steamed lobster and rice. The lobster tail is not even nicely cooked. It's just a frozen cheap supermarket level lobster tail with no seasoning at all. Also tried the chopped pepper steamed fish head. It was just a mediocre level.Used to be here a couple times but today I got the worst service ever. No one refills water for you. No one get you bills lol. Will never come again." u"The food is a very solid 4 stars I have eaten here several times already and I love the rice noodles - authentic spicy comfort food. What made this place stand out for me was the service. They do not use the tip system but I suspect the staff is paid reasonably well because they are attentive and courteous. I witnessed them being incredibly kind to a patron (who looked like he had some kind of developmental disorder and dressed the part) who dropped food all over the table even the floor. When I ordered extra spice for my dish they would also check on if I was happy with the adjusted level. It's really great to see a Chinese restaurant with such a nice waiting staff. I hope they keep it up! :)" u"Horrible customer service. I clearly told the servant not to put eggs in my food because I utterly hate them . He gave me a plate of food with eggs ! I told him I didn't want that and he went in the back and removed the eggs and did not give me a new plate ! Not only that he gave me a smaller portion. Later I noticed some left over eggs. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE THE SERVANT RUSHED ME AND MESSED UP MY ORDER TWICE. Never coming back never ever. Horrible" u'Highly recommended! I have been looking for a real authentic Hunan restaurant for Hunan rice noodles and Hunan dishes for months and finally I was able to find this place! The rice noodles were soooooooo delicious and I felt like I was home. I will definitely try this place again.' u'Walked by this place and what a pleasant surprise!! Had the rice noodle with sour string beans. It is quite authentic. My girlfriend loved it and is still eating when I finished and is writing review with all the excitement. Will come again!' u"Best Chinese food I have had in a long time! The Beef Lo Mein was exquisite! \xa0Flavor and texture were on point al dente and savory. And they sure did not skimp on the meat in the house fried rice. \xa0Lots of beef shrimp and chicken...almost no rice! One interesting note there is no tipping. \xa0There's even a sign on the door. \xa0But that doesn't mean the service was subpar in the least. \xa0Excellent food wonderful service lovely ambiance. We are definitely coming back!" u'I went here after seeing a post in NY food map I order some recommended dish but they were as disappointing as they could. They deliver me a pork dish when I actually ordered beef. They took it back plated in a new plate added some vinegar and brought it out saying it is a newly cooked dish~ service is bad i guess it is because they only have 3 waiter while they have more than 20 tables \xa0here. \u770b\u4e86\u7ebd\u7ea6\u7f8e\u98df\u5730\u56fe\u8fc7\u6765\uff0c\u7c89\u6ca1\u6709\u8bf4\u7684\u597d\u5403\uff0c\u8bf4\u662f\u5356\u5b8c\u4e86\u91cd\u505a\u7684\u3002\u5475\u5475\u3002\u70b9\u4e86\u4efd\u725b\u8089\u4e0a\u4e86\u4efd\u732a\u8089\u3002\u62ff\u56de\u53bb\u56de\u9505\u4e00\u4e0b\u7aef\u51fa\u6765\u53c8\u8bf4\u662f\u65b0\u505a\u7684\u3002\u4e5f\u662f\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u8bf4\u7684\u3002\u670d\u52a1\u8d85\u7ea7\u5dee\u30023\u4e2a\u4eba\u670d\u52a1\u81f3\u5c11100\u4e2a\u4eba\u3002\u4e5f\u662f\u5389\u5bb3\u3002\u8001\u677f\u662f\u6709\u591a\u62a0' u"Rice noodle is really good!

Would definitely recommend to friends!" u'Summary: Do not come here for lunch if you don\'t have a lot of time. 1 person eating here: allocating 1 hr is good. For 2 or more people allocate 1 hr 45 mins - 2hrs. Don\'t bother coming here without a Chinese friend who can speak fluently you\'ll need him/her to constantly ask where the food is. Beef rice noodle soup in their Specials page (on a seperate laminated page) is good. Food here averages $12 $8-10 (without tip) being the norm for a sit down lunch in midtown.Story time: I\'ve been here twice and have had bad times regarding service. The first time my native Chinese speaking friend spoke for me and ordered a beef rice noodle soup. My friend received her food after 15 mins while I waited 20 mins more... for a total of waiting 35 mins with my friend finishing her food and my food STILL didn\'t come out until we asked for the bill. And then a random beef stir fry with chilies came out as my order. What in the whats?! Anyways they took it off our bill after my lovely Chinese friend spoke to them I left the resturant hungry & justifiably upset. Rage ate a banana at work. Clearly I was not meant to cheat on my diet on my cheat day.The second time I was in a party of 3. Again Chinese friend got her food first. Then my 2nd friend after 10 minutes. Then me after 15 minutes for a total of 35 minute wait. There really is nothing more torturous than waiting for your food when your friends are chowing down on their lunch. Anyways. Their beef rice noodle soup is very good slightly spicy but overpriced at $12.95 since customers don\'t tip. I\'d rather go to a Thai place and get pad thai with a side salad for $9 and tip because this place sure doesn\'t deserve it. I\'m not sure if it is the waiters fault actually.. perhaps the cooks are overworked? Either way some personnel changes & additions are highly necessary for the service to stay streamlined. I am optimistic and will go for a third try as I trust that these are just "growing pains".... I hope!! That beef rice noodle soup was pretty good.' u"This place is right across the street to my apartment I had sour and spicy tomato fish dine in before and it was alright. So when I again craved spicy Chinese last night I got my dinner delivered from them.The only reason I didn't give them a one star is that I remembered that one server(middle age white American woman which is rare at Chinese restaurants) there was really friendly.This time I ordered string bean noodle braised pig feet and pickled cabbage. The noodle was okay. Maybe because I'm not a big fan of soft rice noodle and the paste was bland. However the beef broth was tasty. The spicy pig feet tasted just wired. I think it was because of the mushroom more likely to be canned mushroom \xa0in the dish. Just imagine the flavor of preservatives in canned mushroom ewww. The pickled cabbage was INEDIBLE! I don't even know how to describe it feel like just raw cabbage rubbed with salt."]
130.5 Napkin Burger,[u"First time diner here brought by a friend. Let me say I loved the food and would definitely come back again. At my friends recommendation I order the five napkin burger named after the business. It had that cheese on top that reminded me of the kind you'd find on French onion soup. The burger was cooked to perfection as I ordered it. We also had their wings as an appetizer. Also perfectly cooked and juicy. Their wing sauce was very good not sure if home made but tasty. The French fries were those curly shoe string type and tasted excellent as well. We ordered angry orchard beer. They had about 6 to 8 beer choices I think but nothing to craft like. Enough for all to enjoy. Didn't have desert but saw some on other tables and looked delicious. I loved the at atmosphere and the staff was excellent. Our waiter in particular was amazingly attentive wish I could recall his name. Can't wait to come back if the situation finds me in NYC again." u"Why not give 5 Napkins 5 Stars? \xa0The staff was friendly the space was well decorated the ambiance was great and the food was definitely on par with what I was expecting. \xa0We had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and a Turkey Cheese Burger...one with Sweet Potato Fries and one with Regular Hand Cut Fries. \xa0Both were so amazingly good. \xa0The turkey burger was well seasoned and the chicken burger was not drenched in sauce it had just the right amount....Decent place it was great I would go again and experiment with their other burgers. \xa0It is around $15 per burger so that's not terribly fun to pay BUT it was worth it." u"Really great burgers and atmosphere. \xa0I was craving a burger and I had not been here in a long time so while I was in town I dropped into this location. \xa0There was no wait on a Saturday afternoon for a party of two and we got seated right away. \xa0The waiter was on point \xa0and took out drink orders as \xa0soon as we sat down. \xa0We didn't even have to ask for water because he had it ready for us right after we got seated. \xa0 He explained the menu and he specials they had for this particular day. \xa0They have a small selection of local craft beer as well as the popular domestics and imports. \xa0I order a appetizer of the Italian \xa0putine. It was delicious gravy fries with mozzarella cheese curd. \xa0I had the signature 5 napkin burger at it was a great choice. \xa0I love how they have the cheese completely melted into the burger. \xa0The burger it's self was fantastic medium well but still very juicy and flavorful. \xa0I loved the sweat potato fried that I got to go along with my burger sine I had the regular fries in my appetizer. I am a fan and will return." u'I went here with my husband and our two small children. The food was really good but what impressed me most was the extremely courteous service we experienced throughout. We rolled up with a ridiculously large double jogging stroller and just assumed they would want us to park it outside. Instead a host held the door so we could get it in and they had us fold it up and put it in a special spot in the back. They were quick to get a high chair and any time I felt like we were "in the way" (which with two children is constantly) nobody was visibly annoyed by it and they were kind and respectful the whole time.When the server brought my 2 year old his milkshake he even stood and waited for him to say "thank you" and seemed genuinely interested in the exchange smiling the whole time. The waitress was quick to bring our food and our check but we didn\'t feel rushed. We each got a beer (just my husband and I -- the kids drank vodka. Just kidding.) and the waitress provided a recommendation and also let me try my beer before I committed to it. I got the standard burger with caramelized onions and Gruyere. My husband got that same thing but the spicy version. My 2 year old got a kids\' menu burger. All of our burgers came with fries and I substituted onion rings for fries. The fries were great so were the onion rings. My burger\'s bun was a little soggy but the flavor was great. No complaints from the 2 year old or the husband on their burgers.If I could give 10 stars for customer service I would.' u"Five Napkin has been around here for quite some time. Not as popular as Five Guys or Shake Shack but a fixture in the city burger scene. Since there's a lot of competition haven't really tried it until late night Sunday cravings took hold. Ordered the Avocado Ranch Burger ($16) and substituted regular fries with Poutine (a couple bucks extra). Burger is certainly big as you need two hands to hold it and juicy. Was hoping for more guacamole out of this burger and possibly less ranch yet it all stayed within the bun so that's a plus. Poutine was a disappointment. Not enough cheese or gravy and the curds were tiny (at least I got a lot).Got all this to go - got the meal within 15 minutes so decent service. Wouldn't say I'd be back here though they do have a lot of options." u'The Quick: Fantastic burgers drinks and overall comfort food. Very attentive staff and comfortable environment for group. Burgers were cooked perfectly did not feel like a chain restaurant. The Details: I was actually surprised by how good the food was here. That cheddar chili burger (the special) was fantastic and cooked to perfection. The American dream. Everyone was happy with their meals and I was even impressed with the homemade Bloody Mary mix. The Damage: Little pricey for burgers but they come with delicious fries. ~$14 per burger entree.' u"Stopped in for a late-night dinner with bae after a concert and received great service and food. Greeted by the hostess immediately and take to our 2-top. Our server came over and greeted us within a minute and right away he was friendly and nice and pointed out some things about the menu that the burgers come with fries and we can substitute sides from the list. Cool good to know! I ordered the Korean BBQ burger and my lady had the ribs. The food came out really fast well I should say on-time but in this city normal feels like blazing fast sadly. Anyway the guy that ran the food dropped the food at the correct seat numbers and was also nice and friendly. He was in a chef's coat maybe that was chef?? Anyway nice job going above and beyond! I ordered the burger medium rare and it was cooked perfectly not overdone. The appearance and taste were great and as I expected. The onion rings were crunchy and the batter was light and not too fatty or greasy. I tried some of my fianc\xe9e's ribs and they were tasty! Price-wise at first glance the prices seemed high but upon receiving my burger I could see it had two patties and it was a big'un! My eyes got bigger than my mouth and I wolfed the entire thing down and was uncomfortably full for hours after. Well played well played. We finished up got the check and that was that. Our server's name was Ivan and if I come back I'll definitely sit in his section again. Nice job!" u"Amazing burger place and luckily they have multiple locations. \xa0I've tried the Hell's Kitchen and Union Square locations several times and both are spacious and usually popular so you can expect crowds during peak periods.I've tried the original 5 napkin burger Korean and Veggie burger. \xa0The toppings especially the melting cheese on the 5 napkin burger is absolutely delicious and the meat is seasoned well. Their veggie burger is very flavorful and probably popular even for those that eat meat - I know it is for me. \xa0Each burger comes with fries and that can easilybe substituted even for a side salad forthose that want to skip the extra carbs.Overall a decent chain that is at least 1 step beyond your other usual chains around NYC. \xa0They do take online and over the phone reservations and are usually accommodating." u'The Five Napkin burger is cheesy and stoked in rosemary aoli. It was cooked correctly to medium-rare. It came with a forlorn handful or rosemary fries. My wife\'s burger salad had a nice assemblage of greens with an overcooked char-crusted well-done patty of beef. I eat fast but before my wife was done eating -- which I pointed out -- the service said "do you want any dessert" and plunked down the dessert menu. Needless to say this is a turn-the-tables kind of place -- efficient but lacking in warmth food good enough but nothing amazing. Kind of like Applebees.' u'Great service and excellent food. Our server was wonderful. Love this place! The location is good for just stopping for a drink or people watching. In the warm weather they even have seating outdoors! \xa0All of the staff was attentive. Even though they were a bit busy when we arrived our food was served in a timely manner.' u'We\'ve been coming to 5 Napkin quite often and it\'s mostly a great experience with a quick and efficient service and nice food. Some of the recent additions to the menus (my personal favorite the "Lamb Kofta" burger) are great and unique. However last Saturday we were seated at a crowded corner close to the kitchen entrance. I asked the hostess "can we please move to that table over there?" while pointing at an empty table near the one we were seated at. She did not say a word grabbed the menus with an obvious discontent face expression walked to the other table placed the menus and walked away. I am not expecting any business to pamper me with sweet talk or extra attention but at the same time a hostess to my opinion is the face of the restaurant and any type of such rude behavior will always have a much greater effect on the entire dining experience than anything else.' u'The name really says it all. As someone whose favorite food is a good cheeseburger I feel like I have a bit higher than normal expectations. The burger was AMAZING. I went pretty plain jane just cheese bacon and mayo and soooo worth it! the burger was on the larger side and I didn\'t really need the fries but they also were very good!. The wait wasn\'t bad we were there mid day on a Saturday in May so I was honestly a bit shocked we got in as quickly as we did. We did order drinks at the bar while waiting and they were delicious but the bar was very hard to get into almost no space and very busy. Staff seemed very hurried and things seemed rushed. The waitress wasn\'t rude at all but was very "what would you like" "Here are your drinks" "anything else?" Etc.' u'Recently came here for dinner after not being here for a while (the food was getting pretty gross) and was pleasantly surprised. Totally revamped menu with plenty of healthy options. Will definitely be back.' u'The veggie burger is truly awesome!!! Cocktails are gigantic and service is okay.Only downside is their fries - they SUCK.' u"My all-time favorite burger restaurant for a (somewhat) classy sit-down experience. The staff is extremely friendly and makes for a comfortable environment that's also great for groups. Plus if there's a holiday they usually deck out the place with decorations. Burgers here are cooked to perfection. I always order medium-rare and am never disappointed. It's greasy but umami in my mouth making me finish every bite even though I'm already stuffed by the delicious fries. The dishes are pretty expensive ($15/burger and side) but totally worth the experience and great food.They used to have wasabi deviled eggs and potato skin appetizers which were the bomb but they stopped serving them the last time I came. Bring them back 5 Napkin Burger!!" u'Really really good burgers and fries and onion rings! \xa0Great wine selection. \xa0Our server was really friendly and knowlegable about Broadway shows. \xa0Food came out really quick. \xa0Was a great place to go before the show.' u'I are burger bowl with salad. It has good vegetarian choices.Good part is its quiet near to times Square. So if you are taking the Big Bus tours and wanna get something to eat before a good place to go.' u'it gives me great pleasure to update my previous review of 5 Napkin Burger and note that they have bought in new management that is already making a difference. After having a bad experience with customer service a month ago I was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by management who took the time to listen to what happened and vowed to correct it. I have since returned 3 times and the food continues to be delicious and I have met the new management (Alex and Julio are terrific) and being in the business myself I can see how much they care about the customer service experience. \xa05 Napkin definitely has all the right tools \xa0(casual delicious food outdoor seating nice ambiance and a creative drink menu) having managers like Julio and Alex who care so much about customer experience will ensure that it remains one of the most popular restaurants in Hells KitchenAs a side note besides their amazing burgers if you never had chicken and waffles before and cant even imagine pairing the 2 together do yourself a favor and order it at 5 Napkin - they make it about as good as I have ever tried in all my travels around the USThank you 5 Napkin and I look forward to many more yummy visits to come' u"This place was just ok. Nothing to write home about. I swapped out fries for the cheesy tots. I had the double cheeseburger and blueberry mint lemonade. I probably wouldn't go again." u"Got the Korean BBQ burger. It was really salty because it was doused in soy sauce. Our waiter gave me fair warning but it was worse than expected. The tuna poke appetizer was sub par but we finished it anyway. Overall it was an okay experience being the first time. Will give it 3 stars because I'm not too harsh of a critic and appreciate all food. Service was OK."]
90.Kobeyaki,[u'The tuna tataki salad is the perfect item to satisfy a Japanese craving with something healthy. The creamy ginger dressing that comes with it is excellent- similar to the traditional carrot ginger dressing served in Japanese restaurants but creamy!I also had the beef teriyaki bowl. The beef was good- not dry as you would expect in a typical lunch spot. I would compare the teriyaki to the kind you get in mall food courts but I mean that in a good way.' u'Came around 12:30 during lunch time rush. The line to order moved quite quickly and so did the line for picking up food. However that "waiting corner" is a mess. It\'s super crowded and awkwardly close to the condiments. I was constantly shifting places so people could get their orders or so I wasn\'t in anyone\'s way.I got a shrimp bowl with brown rice and my sister got a pork bun/sandwich. Her pork bun was super flavorful but my shrimp bowl is another story. The veggies were okay but the shrimp was really bland and didn\'t taste like anything. My sister said the brown rice was pretty soft compared to other places though which is a good thing cause brown rice tends to be harder than white rice.Seating fills up quickly but people are in and out so we didn\'t have any trouble finding space.I would come again for the bun but not for the bowl.' u"Don't be intimidated by the lunch rush line it goes quickly. The place is clean and has a decent amount of seating for groups of 2-4.Soft Shell Crab Bun: Tasty! Just the right amount of crispiness spicy mayo goes PERFECTLY with it. You can get more mayo in the condiments area. Seemed small for its price point you'd get a better bang for your buck going with a bowl option but this is a nice detour from your usual lunches.Tempura Sweet Potato Fries: Also on point with the crispiness pretty good to try with their few sauce options but my favorite is still the spicy mayo.Would return to try one of their bowls." u"There are some serious staples in this establishment. Serious.Kobeyaki: a fast food Japanese joint serving anything but fast food. Watch out for the lunch crowd the line can easily be out the door and you could be in for a 20 minute wait. Well worth the wait? For some menu items yes.After ordering you're given a buzzer and once your order is ready it comes in a very sturdy brown bag. Perfect for the city that's always on-the-go. Noteable items:Udon Noodle Soup ($10) - shrimp tempura on the side with nori scallions tofu tempura flakes an abundant amount of udon and the pink colored fish cakes. What more can you love? Perfect amount for a filling lunch.Tuna Tataki Salad ($11) - avocado edamame a lovely blend of romaine cabbage cucumber & carrots topped with thinly sliced seared tuna. Their ginger dressing is probably the best tasting thing marrying this lovely salad together.Soft Shell Crab Bun ($12) - actually the best thing on this menu. Fried soft shell crab a generous scoop of crabmeat a mix of Japanese mayo unagi sauce and spicy mayo topped with Bahn Mi like vegetables perfectly pickled and adds a nice texture.I'd avoid the sushi there's other much better (maybe even cheaper) places you can find your California Roll. (Psst. check out Wasabi on 40th & 7th)" u"I'm always incredibly satisfied when coming to Kobeyaki! It runs a little on the expensive side as you have to order everything individually but I Don't mind paying a few extra bucks for good food. The beef burger was juicy and flavorful and my veggie udon bowl was packed with vegetables - I had so many left overs I could have probably split it into another two meals. My boyfriend loved his crispy sweet potato tempura fries and my miso soup was light flavorful and refreshing. We also got a veggie roll that my boyfriend devoured despite claiming to not be a vegetable fan - the rolls are really large but fall apart really easily. It's packed on weekends and during rush hour but for a 7 pm Monday dinner there were no lines and a decent amount of empty tables." u"Kobeyaki was recommended to me by a friend of mine. We decided to come here after work for a quick bite. I quickly decided that I wanted to know what a Japanese style kobe burger would taste like. Also saw that the fries were very highly rated so I ordered that as a side. The Kobe burger was nothing spectacular and it definitely lost some points in the flavor department. I did however enjoy the texture of the burger itself. Between the soft ciabatta bread and crunchy coleslaw it definitely had the works of an amazing burger. I felt as if the burger meat itself was unseasoned. It also felt as if it was missing something. Maybe it could have used a few pickles. The spicy mayo was good but I would've liked some more of it. The fries are the saving grace of this review. It is rare enough to find sweet potato fries but to find sweet potato fries that aren't soggy or overly oily is near impossible. The potato fries here were excellent. Perfectly crisp and still maintained that sweet soft potato on the inside. I do regret ordering the burger but I would definitely order the fries again. Maybe this time I'll let my friend order first and copy whatever she gets." u"At first I didn't want to get the soft shell crab burger because the picture showed the crab's legs and I found that a bit creepy. But made the jump and it was great!! No legs either. Also ordered the tempura sweet potato fries. Those were yummy but made me feel more unhealthy than eating regular sweet potato fries. Appreciated the plethora of sauces they had!! The star of the show was the spicy mayo. The wasabi mayo helped my friend clear her sinuses though." u"Y'all better off passing on this Asian fusion eatery. After having failed to make a last minute reservation at a nearby restaurant we decided to just find something on Yelp while walking towards Port Authority. We were getting near and I hadn't seen anything that caught my eye yet so we jumped in at the first site of a somewhat trendy modern-chic decorated down-to-earth joint that didn't have a bar (they do however sell alcohol... Anytime is a good time for sake indeed- but tonight I was trying my bet to pass on that since my liver has been cursing up a storm from Monday night).There was no line when we walked in. We both ordered the grilled chicken rice bowl. I didn't look at the menu close enough. Had I known they offered brown rice white rice udon and salad for the bowls I would've leaned towards getting a salad bowl. But the lady taking our order only asked whether we'd want white or brown rice. If they were out of the other two options I'd like that to be noted somewhere- verbally or physically. Nothing else on the menu really jumped out at me and with my gluten allergy burgers were out of the question. We took a 4 seater booth and stacked up on sauce - their sauce station game is strong. Spicy wasabi terriyaki ketchup (tastes like straight up ketchup to us) spicy mayo all on the pump like an upscale McDonalds for Asia and a bottle of sriracha. There's also heaps of wasabi and soy sauce patches. Grab a plastic cup from the cashier area if you're dining in to get some water.The buzzer rang and we leaped for the pick up station. Everything was swell until the food came out *sigh*. Totally meh. My face fell. The terriyaki sauce tasted like an even crappier quality than what supermarkets offer. With high sodium content (I drank a gallon after this tonight) but not much of any other flavor I was drowning the bowl with sriracha. Chicken pieces were lacing and the vegetables could've been cooked better (into softer pieces). I was nauseated after finishing 1/3rd of the bowl and gave up. If you can't do a grilled chicken bowl right I can't imagine what on the menu they can do right." u"we were looking for a place to get some lunch fast. so we came across this burger/Asian fusion eatery by our hotel. Kobeyaki has burgers rice bowls sushi rolls salads n soups. it's like an Asian fast food joint. u walk in n order at the counter pay n wait for your number to b up as u sit at a table. the shop is small n dim. if we walked faster we probably would've missed it. thank god I saw the Kobeyaki sign on the front window. during the lunch hour it gets pretty busy. the tables r all along the left side plus a couple in the front window facing out to the street. we had no idea what to order having never heard of this place or the food. I immediately saw a pic of their burger with soft shell crab n wanted it! (seriously can't say no to soft shell crab.) so we both got one n some sodas. Soft Shell Crab Bun : this burger would've been a dud if not for the saving grace of the spicy mayo. that mayo is legit. the burger itself is a normal size. not too small not too big. I was kinda disappointed in how it didn't come out looking like the one on the wall with all the legs protruding out. it was instead more like a round piece of crab. oh well." u"We needed somewhere nearby and quick for lunch. \xa0Prior to flying out to NY I had Kobeyaki bookmarked as it was nearish to our hotel. \xa0So why not? \xa0We hit the lunch rush but the line moves fast and tables turn around at a decent rate. \xa0Kobeyaki kind of seems like the Asian equivalent to Chipotle (minus the assembly line in front of you). \xa0You can choose from a rice bowl noodle bowl or salad format with your choice of protein or opt for a burger or sushi roll. \xa0He and I both got the teriyaki chicken bowl option but I opted for udon noodles and he got white rice. \xa0I totally forgot to say no edamame in mine as I do not care for them at all and was totally trying to avoid them when I was eating my dish. \xa0It came with all natural chicken breast edamame carrot scallions onion zucchini teriyaki sauce sesame seeds and yellow squash. \xa0After about 10 minutes our buzzer went off and the food was ready to eat. \xa0Not bad for about $10 in this pricey part of the city. \xa0Everything tasted pretty fresh and the chicken was moist. \xa0The noodles were fine but doesn't absorb any sauce like rice does so I noticed how over sauced my dish was because of this and a little on the salty side. \xa0I like how Kobeyaki also has an assortment of other items if you aren't feeling a rice or noodle bowl. \xa0I would have been adventurous and tried one of their fish offerings but I'm always a little cautious with ordering fish at restaurants and if I felt like getting my hands a little dirty I would have chose one of their burger options. \xa0I would choose Kobeyaki over Chipotle any day. \xa0It's fine for what it is but not a destination eatery." u'Love this place! Delicious burgers friendly staff and cozy environment. Great place to stop in and get some amazing grub for an affordable cost. True to the statement "Japanese Chipotle" (minus the e-coli).' u"Kobeyaki is freakin' awesome! This is my 2nd time here during my 4day visit here in NY & I am grateful I discovered this place. I am picky & a health nut ergo not easy to please me. Sushi & bowls with brown rice was the first hint of how they can accommodate such a difficult customer. The spider roll is fresh crunchy & a big portion (8 rolls peeps). The green salad had several slices of avocado. The spicy tuna burger is so yummy and also a big portion. Tempura sweet potato is not too breaded so it was okay (guilt food). And by the way our 2nd visit was a party of 10 & they still did not disappoint! Janet was extremely courteous and patient with us. She accommodated all our special request with a smile. Janet please do not change & you deserve a raise (she was working on June 29th at 7pm). This place has a reasonable price and the food is of great quality for a fast food. Please open up in LA Thanks again Janet!" u'I was pleasantly surprised by this place. \xa0I needed a place to eat quickly and had ramen and a roll. \xa0They were both pretty good for a quick serve place. \xa0The broth was satisfying and had generous serving pork. \xa0The roll was also fresh and tasted good. \xa0Not bad at all.' u'Solid quick takeout in midtown. Had the teriyaki bowl with chicken over udon.Very much enjoyed the mixed vegetables they add to their bowls and the overall dish was a well balanced teriyaki saltiness with a little sweet.' u"I had high expectations for this place because my friend had told me about it. I wouldn't say it was the worst but it definitely was disappointing. I got the kobeyaki salad - the fish was good but the lettuce was skimpy and the portion size was a lot smaller than it looked. I was definitely still hungry but didn't want to pay for another meal. My friend had a burger which was wrapped nicely and looked good and the sweet potato fries seemed okay too but again a little too thin and not filling enough. I came famished here after a long bus ride and I left feeling still hungry. Not the worst - but not nearly the best." u'First time at Kobeyaki! My friend from work insisted that we go here for lunch because she loves their food. \xa0I\'m not a huge fan of Asian food so I ordered what I thought would be the "safe option" the California Roll. I was not disappointed! My roll was huge and \xa0absolutely delicious! \xa0I can\'t wait to try other things on their menu.The one downside is that there isn\'t much seating in the restaurant so be ready to fight other people for tables.' u"Kobeyaki is one of my favorite go-to lunch spots but only for pickup via online ordering on their website (not available on Seamless/Grubhub). Until I used their online ordering service I didn't realize you could substitute meats in the soups (they don't make this clear in person) specify what you want/don't want in your sushi or how you want your meat/tuna cooked. It's not a particularly small location but there's never any seating during lunchtime and the line is always almost to the door during the lunch hour rush. It's definitely crowded even by Times Square/Theatre District standards. They've recently added a new interior door vestibule-type thing to prevent the cold air from coming in and they're down another seat because of it. \xa0If you do end up waiting on line their turnaround is pretty quick once you actually put your order in. It's usually chaos by the register though between the people picking up food waiting to order food and then people trying to get their sauces and utensils. I feel like they need to utilize that space better space rather than use part of it for seating for customers waiting for their orders. No one ever really ends up using it because their turnaround is pretty quick.I think their $8-9/item is pretty standard for the area but it's more fair here because of their portion size. \xa0Their udon and ramen soups have lasted me for two meals. My hands down favorite thing to order here is their tuna burger which I think is even better than tuna burgers I've had at upscale restaurants. I've also enjoyed their tofu veggie bowl - they separate the tofu so it doesn't get soggy. \xa0The chicken sandwich was pretty unimpressive though. One thing I don't get is why they have such huge to-go bags. I wish they'd just give a simple brown paper bag. They finaly got rid of the cardboard boxes that would go inside the bags making it even bigger. \xa0My half eaten lunch takes up tons of space in the work fridge. Plus their fries and burgers don't have a foil thing so once you open it up you're out of luck trying to wrap it up to bring home because it's all loose. Overall though it's a great place and I'd definitely recommend." u'Stopped by for quick dinner after passing by dozens of times. Interior is clean and minimal and place was not too busy. I ordered the Kobeyaki burger of course since this is my first experience here. At $9ish price isn\'t bad at all and wait time was only about 5 min. Burger came nicely wrapped but not overly so like some places that make it cumbersome to eat. They have three sauce pumps so I took sample of wasabi mayo teriyaki kept up and good ole sriracha. The other one was spicy mayo.Upon a bite I really liked the quality of beef- it had that not from frozen texture that was also tender. I liked the medley of shredded carrots and cabbage. Not much teriyaki onion to find though. I mostly ate through without putting anymore sauce on because beef tasted good with the light amount already on the burger.I finished mine within 10 minutes at moderate pace... it was good but 20% short of reaching full satisfaction level for me a voracious eater 6\'3". Of course I\'m sure that\'s what the restaurant intended so that you\'d add side of fries. In fact if it weren\'t for time I would\'ve gotten some! Pretty good overall. I\'m coming back to try their ramen and soft shell crab bun next time!' u"Nice hidden spot by the park.Grilled chicken bow is pretty good $9.15Spicy tuna burger was good but missing something maybe it was a little dry or lacking in some ingredient I'm not sure but really tasted like it needed a little extra something. $8.95Sweet potato fries are amazing$3.25Green tea sandwich was really good not too sweet and stays perfect temp while you eat the rest of your food. $3.25Yuengling I don't remember what this was but I know it cost me $5.06 hahahaThis place is nice quite and clean would return for sure." u'This is a good midtown lunch spot for work I but don\'t think it should be considered a "must try" restaurant. It\'s basically an Asian fusion version of Chipotle (minus the e.coli outbreak issue of course).Employees are very nice and work quickly. The line is always very long during lunch hour but it goes by very fast! If 20 people are in front of you I\'d expect a 5-7 minute wait = not long at all. It\'s extremely close to BDFM or NQR 42nd Street trains and don\'t worry - this is one of the few areas in Times Square that is not taken over by slow walking tourists with their selfie stickies almost hitting you in the face. Good times..Grilled Chicken Bowl - \xa0you pick either: chicken shrimp beef or vegetables. Bowl bases include: brown rice salad udon noodles or white rice. \xa0It comes with: edamame yellow squash scallions and zucchini. (Note: you can request 2 bowl bases ie brown rice and salad) \xa0It\'s very good but it\'s too saucy for my taste. I wish they would add more edamame/veggies to make it a healthier meal (vs. the sauce which has a lot of sodium).Kobeyaki Burger - they add terikyaki ketchup and spicy mayo to their wagyu beef patty... great combo! It comes with cucumber lettuce scallions... VERY GOOD! The bun is amazing!Tuna Tataki Salad - Very good salad! Seared tuna edamame avocado lettuce cucumber scallions... creamy ginger dressing!']
206.HB Burger,[u'Congratulations HB Burger you just cracked my Top 3 Best Burgers!!HB obviously stands for Heartland Brewery but I\'m gonna pretend it stands for Holy Burger because holy cow what a burger!! We stumbled upon this place because we were pressed for time before our 8pm showtime for American Psycho the Musical. Sat down right away and took a little peak a boo at the menu. We all decided to order the Burger Deluxe which came dressed with aged white cheddar lettuce tomato a huge fried onion ring bacon and my favorite topping garlic aioli as well as a heaping portion of hand cut fries. Got my burger Medium Well and boy was it cooked spot on. Perfect shade of pink and just the right amount of juicy lucyiness. I was happy I did not have to worry about the blood running down my hand as I ate it because there was enough blood in the show after dinner.We also split an order of the "Must Try" Tater Tots. These aren\'t your typical tots they were homefries disguised as taters.They are advertised as made with slabs of bacon but I couldn\'t taste any bacon. I forgot I was sharing this side with two other people and nearly ate the whole tin can. They were that good!!This burger was bursting with flavor perfectly seared on the griddle. The compliment of the potato roll is such an exemplary vessel; that they are all one needs to reach burger Nirvana. HB definitely has one of the best burgers in the city and \xa0is totally reasonably priced for the Tourist Trap called Times Square.' u"Came for lunch while traveling heading abroad. The service was quick and the food was good. The staff was very helpful. Just for checking in we received a free slice of cheesecake. Since the place appears to be a burger place we ordered a burger and a chicken sandwich to share. The chicken sandwich and burger were both good but the burger wasn't cooked well enough. We requested a medium burger but it was served medium rare. For an appetizer we had the cheese sticks which were thick and hearty. The cheese sticks were amazing. Actually they were the star of the meal. The fries that came with the burger were quite good and well seasoned. The cheesecake was ok not anything to write home about. The service was actually quick. We came in during lunch time and was seated within minutes. If you are into burgers this is a place I would give a try because the menu primarily caters to various types of burgers." u"The place was a bit packed but I was able to find a seat at the end of the bar. I started with their IPA. The beer wasn't very cold and it was a little flat. For dinner I ordered their HB Beef burger cooked medium and the tater tots. I finished off the burger with their oatmeal stout. Again the beer was tepid and flat. The bartender saw that I noticed that the beers were off so she took both drinks off of my bill.*HB Beef burger*The burger was cooked the way I wanted and not bad but not something worth writing home.*Tater tots*It wasn't your typical tater tots. These were made with smoked slab bacon and jalape\xf1o jack. They were good but I was expecting more tater tots. Overall: Food was decent and service was good but I would still like to try other burger places in the area." u'Best hamburger ever for less than $10. Yummy fries great atmosphere right off Times Square' u"Not a bad restaurant at all. I ordered the veggie burger and it's true it's a delicious burger that is made in-house. I also had sweet potato fries (a bit pricey for the small amount that they give you) and overall it was a decent lunch." u"The burger was cooked very well and the topping did a nice job at complementing the meat. One of the few burgers I've had where it actually tasted better the more I ate it." u"I'm ashamed to say this...but we ate here twice on our three night trip in New York.The first time we ate here was because we had just finished taping Jimmy Fallon it was pouring down rain and their sister restaurant (the name is escaping me) turned us away.When I got there I was told there would be a 30 minute wait...so then I booked us a table on Open Table got the points and skipped the 30 minute wait! ha ha ha!We split a bunch of appetizers and beers the first night (we were on a limited schedule because we were about to see a play).The next night it was only me and mom and we were hungry and too tired to decide on a place to eat. Since we had the sliders the night before at HB burger we opted for the regular size burgers and a flight of beer.Let me just tell you - ever single guy in that restaurant was jealous of Mom and I's flight of beer. If you would just READ THE MENU you would also see that you could get 7 miniature bears also. This place also gives you a free dessert for checking in...so if you are reading this -- Check in!" u"Delicious. Fun. Our second trip to Heartland didn't disappoint. We started off with the fried pickles and gosh they were good. For entrees I got the burger deluxe and my wife got the buffalo style beef burger. Both were incredibly tasty. We also got the oatmeal stout and the black velvet beer cocktail. Without a doubt some of the tastiest beers around. Our server was quick and friendly and the food was delivered surprisingly fast. We got a slice of cheesecake to top it off (it was the free dessert with check-in) which was all right. Overall this is one of our favorite places to eat in NYC." u'Excellent service from our waiter Eric. The Kobe Beef Burgers were great. We made our show Beautiful (across the street) in plenty of time.' u"Great burgers \xa0starting at $10 ( no fries).$13-17 will get you a specialty burger with fries.The burgers are pretty big. The patty looks about 1/2 lb. It was cooked how I wanted.The bun was massive and looked great but was a bit on the stale side. It couldn't stand up to the the burger juice and the bottom started falling apart.The fries were pretty good. Average. I'd recommend skipping them and getting an order of the tots everyone talks about.They have a nice mixed beer menu with stuff like beers mixed with cider. I had the Snakebite for $7 which was really delicious.Service at the bar was fast and attentive but the kitchen completely ignored my request for blue cheese dressing on the side.If you check in on yelp you get a free slice of cheesecake which is a nice bonus since its normally $7. Overall pretty good burger and great service.===Looking for the best burgers in NYC? Check out my NYC Burger List" u'HB Burger is the best. The burgers are juicy and fresh and the fries and onion strings are done just right. The staff was friendly and prompt. I give it 5 stars.' u'Fabulous burgers and beer at reasonable prices. Wonderful hand cut fries. Prompt friendly service. Great seasonal beers. Fun atmosphere.' u"After failing miserably at going to Bryant Park for ice skating (way too crowded) my beer boo and I decided that the huge Heartland Brewery sign was too irresistible especially at 11am. As the huge sign was sucking us in there was only one thing that was going to stop us - HB Burger - Heartland Brewery apparent kid bro.Place was relatively empty and pretty dark considering how bright and active Manhattan was on a beautiful MLK Day.Service was great taking time to explain the beers and the burger options.I still fresh on my weight loss resolution opted for the bison burger and topped it with pickled jalapenos and sauteed onions. So maybe sauteed onions wasn't so healthy but it does sound healthier than cheese and bacon! The burger was perfectly cooked; not dry whatsoever. \xa0The bun held up quite well. I forgot to ask for the wheat bun offering. The regular burgers don't come with a side but considering my resolution I actually didn't mind. And considering the area a bison burger for $10 is quite good.As for the not-so-resolution portion of the meal:Not Tonight Honey PorterBavarian Black LagerRed Rooster AleFarmer Jon's Oatmeal StoutAll were really good. though nothing really mindblowing. They have a microbrew for just about any taste at any time. It seems you really can't go wrong with any of their selection it's just a matter of what you're in the mood for. 23 oz is the best deal but the pint glasses match the beer you're drinking!" u'My server was great! \xa0He recommended I try the tots and he was right. \xa0They were sooo good. I had them with my crispy chicken sandwich. \xa0Everything was awesome. \xa0I did wish that I had maybe 2 more tots on the plate though. \xa0lol' u"Sorry.......not worth the money or time. Service poor and average over priced food. The waiter was unresponsive and the food was much like McDonald's. So much for good heartland food and service." u'This was the first resto me and my dining companions saw to dine at before we made our way to Broadway. \xa0We were seated right away and alerted the waiter that we were in a bit of a rush. I opened the menu and noticed not too much of an option. All of a sudden I laid my eyes on this perfect specimen which was called "Burger Deluxe" \xa0I said o0Ohh I think Im gunna go for this one. Then we all decided to try it because it sounded like a dream burger! Our food came out in just a fee minutes and we wasted Zero time. Cut that juicyness right down the middle and the first bite was like pure butter. The beef was cooked to perfection was a hint of crunchiness from the onion ring. I love shredded lettuce and tomato on my burger and aged cheddar..UH! i had to control myself from moaning at the taste of this \xa0The fries were awesome. Period. I was sad I couldnt finish the burger bc it was super filling but whenever I am in the mood for one I know exactly where to go now!! Weekend made by this place!!!' u'The Burger Deluxe is the sauce boss but the Onion straws were very greasy and almost not cooked the same amount like the one that came on the burger. Overall it was a great experience!!' u"I can only review the beer as that's all we had. And that was fantastic. Got a sampler and liked them all except the stout but I'm not really a dark beer drinker and it wasn't even that bad. The bartender was awesome even gave us a few extra samples to try. He got tipped nicely ;)Can't say anything about the food but if you're looking for some good beer go on in" u"We tried to go drinking down the street at Heartland Brewery but they were full and only seating for dinner but they directed us here. \xa0It was a good thing!My wife and I ordered the $17 Seasonal Flight of beer. \xa0It came with their 6 standard brews plus a choice of one of their 4 seasonal beers. \xa0We enjoyed most all of them. \xa0The ones we didn't weren't their fault we're just not heavy lager or IPA fans in general but those weren't all that bad!The bartender noticed me checking into each beer on Untappd and nicely brought us over tiny shots of 3 other beers they had on tap so we could try them too. \xa0They were good.Great place to drop in and have a drink (and the food looked good but we were in a rush to a show)!" u"Awesome food prices were fair given the part of town and beer was delicious. Our server was super nice and didn't rush us or push anything on us.I'd recommend even if they aren't busy to make a reservation. Their main floor is very packed and loud but those who made reservations got a seat downstairs where it was very quiet.Be sure to check in on Yelp! The free cheesecake was great."]
191.Medi Winebar,[u"Brunch was amazing! The baked egg dish with tomatoes was one of the best brunch dishes I've ever had. Be warned that the prices on the website are lower than the actual menu prices. Quit being greedy and raising your prices so much." u'Went here for lunch. Was extremely disappointed.... food was bland menu online was less expensive than the menu at the resturant. On another sour note the bathroom facilities are less than ideal requiring the user to affix the door handle upon entry and exit of the facilities. \xa0-Bad date spot. -nice outside garden' u"After some hits here the misses have finally won out. This place has become completely skippable. If you can't grab a table outside in the back (don't take one out front - you'll die from car exhaust) go somewhere else. The brunch is ok...there's plenty to drink and some ok dishes. But nothing really that good. My most recent visit here topped the $100 mark very quickly with just a mediocre bottle of their cheapest red wine some olives that could've been off the cold bar at a grocery store terrible Calamari Bruschetta with what seemed like dried Prego smeared over too much bread and chewy/cold squid and over-cooked lamb balls on pita. Sad to say that this place's best days are in the past. I'd highly recommend spending your hard earned money elsewhere." u'This place screams "chick place". \xa0Small servings of blah blah food for lots of money. \xa0We were a group of six for lunch and we\'re actually wanting to eat at Annabels but it wasn\'t open. \xa0So we decided to try Medi next door since we were starving. \xa0We had nothing but small sandwiches and salads and one of our party had a glass of wine. \xa0The bill was $114. So not worth it in my book. \xa0The food quality was decent but nothing special. Especially at those prices.' u"Came back again on Saturday night with 8. We had a great time. Good service our server kept the drinks flowing. We tried a bunch of different cocktails from the menu but The Best & Medi were definitely the most popular. We didn't feel rushed at all. It got busy for dinner so reservations are recommended especially on weekends. We had several appetizers: Chef's cheese & meats platters Grilled Portuguese Octopus (perfectly cooked) Rice croquettes Bone marrow Burrata (really good) Ceviche (average). Main courses on the table were Couscous Casserole (really good) Risotto special (very good) special fish & a few other items. Everything was good & we were all quite happy with our meal.The menu has more choices in appetizers/tapas than main courses and you won't see a lot of the traditional Mediterranean dishes on the menu....I would say it's more fusion. But overall a nice place with a lovely Cellar room & backyard dining as well." u"Honestly I chose this place for the bonus opentable points. Came here for late lunch (2pm) and the restaurant was still pretty full. I loved the atmosphere when I first walked in- the windows were decorated with airy curtains and the wood tables in the middle of the restaurant were placed at an angle so it didn't feel rigid. Every table was also decorated with fresh tulips. My friend was really hungry and went with the steak and eggs ($22) while I went for the eggs Benedict with salmon ($18) we also got a side of Gruyere cheese ($5). The menu was a little misleading because we thought it would include all 4 cheeses listed but the waitress told us it's $5 for each type. Steak and eggs - what a measly portion. There were literally 5 pieces of thinly cut steak eggs and a giant bed of arugula. For $22 it was definitely not worth a burger would've been more filling. Eggs Benedict w/ salmon - this was super yummy and the eggs were poached nicely. The sauce was creamy but not overwhelming. It also came with a huge portion of arugula salad. Gruyere cheese - I don't know how long it was aged but we both enjoyed it no complaints.Overall the experience here was okay we were just really put off by how small the steak and eggs portion was. *They have bottomless brunch here" u"My go to place for light fare in Hell's Kitchen. \xa0Try the downstairs it is much more intimate." u'I absolutely love love love this restaurant. The ambiance is cute romantic but not pretentious (perfect for a date!). The service is good but most importantly the food is DELICIOUS perfectly seasoned and spiced and not too heavy. My favorite dish here is the grilled Portuguese Octopus..amazing and fresh similar to what I had when I visited Portugal. \xa0I would also recommend the Pappardelle "Al Limone" a fresh and light pasta dish with lemon basil cheese and almond. I\'ve also had the meats and cheeses hummus lamb kofte seafood couscous bone marrow and a bunch of other dishes and have not been disappointed. Recommend this 100% -- I keep coming back!' u"When in doubt Medi. Medi is my go to in Hell's Kitchen for brunch (especially with the great prices on pitchers of boozy brunch drinks). The food is consistently good the service is always good and it's fairly easy to make a reservation. In the summer you can sit outside in their garden but the main dining room is also sun-filled and delightful.My favorite dish is the Shakshouka - it's hot both temperature wise and spice-level wise and I usually use an entire basket of bread to soak up the tomato sauce - no shame. The baked eggs with sausage mushroom cream and gruyere is also a favorite - super rich and creamy and perfect. For ultimate fatty status I recommend the homemade brioche stuffed with nutella - you won't regret it (or you will but it's okay).Dinner at Medi is also a solid choice - with plenty of Mediterranean/Italian dishes as well as good cocktails. Medi is totally underrated and definitely a great option in HK!" u"I've gone here during the summers for the past two years while I visit and have loved it every time. \xa0Always unique food options and great service. \xa0I always sit outside as they have a few picnic tables lined up along the restaurant. \xa0No separation with planters between walkers or tables but it is not crowded. \xa0Last year they had the most amazing bacon wrapped dates with goat cheese as one of their small plates... which I was sad they didn't have again this year. \xa0But instead this year they had fried artichokes and a calamari brushetta that was amazing! Love the tapas idea as I can order a lot of plates for our group and try a little of everything. \xa0This is a sure bet for us every year." u'Came here for brunch with the girlfriend. \xa0Fantastic seating in the garden and great food. \xa0Very untraditional food options for brunch but we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. \xa0She wont\'t stop asking me "when are we going back?!"' u"Overpriced Americanized quasi-Mediterranean/Greek food you might expect to pay $9.99 for at the local Olive Garden. The wine was even more inflated. Service was something like Leonardo DiCaprio's Jay Gatsby had he worked in the service sector. The atmosphere was comfortable and inviting however and perhaps with more reasonable prices and a different server things may have gone differently. My biggest complaint is the pasta I ordered. I had expected something light and tart. The Parmesan was heavy and piled on a la American style and sat in my stomach like a baseball. \xa0A fist in the stomach after a few oysters and a light salad. Just a bland not great evening that would have deserved another star had the prices been more in line with (my perception) of the quality of food. What I appreciated was the eclectic variety of diners. \xa0There were the Chelsea gays with their style and poise the straight couple out for a romantic evening and families sharing a special meal together. \xa0Kudos for the excellent atmosphere and ambiance." u"I went here for brunch. \xa0It is a great boozy brunch deal. You order an entree and order as many pictures of mimosas and bloody Mary's you want for a set price. \xa0My omelette was great." u"I held my birthday party in the basement and it was great. The ambiance is very nice great decor and cute layout. It's a very nice area to host a party - and the appetizers were great. The main entrees were generally good but the chicken was terrible only downside to that evening. The wine was great and service was excellent. Super cute place to host a party and have fun." u"If I could give no stars I would. Never experienced a more rude manager unwilling to accommodate a request for a garden table with our reservation because of the disruptive food festival on 9th Ave. Considering the restaurant was empty with a plethora of reservations available that night this guy has no concept of customer service or business. We won't return." u"Awesome spot! Fabulous food and great atmosphere inside as well as an outside garden area. Had the mixed seafood with couscous dish and it was wonderful. They were closing the patio around 11 but let us stay there until closing and were accommodating in moving us inside or the outside area in front of the restaurant to finish our meal. Would def recommend for a friend or date spot in Hell's Kitchen." u'$60 dollar brunch for two with no drinks... and it was AWFUL. I gave them a one star because ZERO was not an option.First I wanted french toast the menu said "maple syrup" but still I specifically asked the server if there was real maple syrup. The kitchen said "yes" so I ordered.What arrived was a watery maple flavored corn syrup.I told the manager and he looked at me with disdain. "THAT is maple syrup." (I guess the customer isn\'t always right at MEDI) I asked to see the bottle and they brought forth a plastic jug clearly labled Pancake Syrup with the key ingredient being corn syrup.I next ordered a MEDI omelet. A cooked scrambled eggs disk wrapped around COLD pre-cooked spinich onions feta and tomatoes arrived.Too hungry to send it back I ate the egg portion.Save yourself the trouble. The restaurant next door looked pretty good. LOL MEDI is short for MEDIOCRE.' u"One of my new favorite spots in NYC the two chefs are amazing and they use the freshest of ingredients. I trust their judgement and will never ask them to modify a dish again! (Also because they won't ). The Greek Salad is incredible as are the Eggs Benedict and Two Baked Eggs (on the brunch menu). Also the Steak and Chicken Sandwich the Panna cotta... Everything is so good. The wine selection is also fantastic I'm a fan of their Bordeaux with the label Pentimento. The vibe is casual and relaxed with a European feel. There is also a small patio in the back for summer dinning.The staff is also great and our regular waiter was always accommodating. I highly recommend this place.I went back recently and neither of the two chefs Luca and Andre were working that day. I asked to make certain but it was obvious in the preparation and taste of the food. This would explain the mixed reviews." u'Nice ambiance but I expected a lot better. The place leaves a lot to be desired.The buratta appetizer was really good and I enjoyed my blackberry cocktail. However dinner was very underwhelming.My boyfriend ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli and I got the papardelle "al limone." I enjoyed my papardelle but the $12-13+ we paid for his four ravioli was definitely not worth the price. The menu specifically noted that all pasta was made "fresh" but we both saw bags of frozen ravioli being unloaded in the kitchen as we ate our appetizers. The details everywhere else in the restaurant are so nice that it was a shame to see that and you could definitely tell that they were frozen.The server seemed nice but was a little clueless. When she asked how our dinner was going and my boyfriend mentioned that it was generally okay but that he was disappointed she said that she was glad to hear it and carried on without inquiring as to why. I won\'t be returning.' u"This place has such a cute garden in the back. Totally unexpected and takes you away from the hectic NYC life. I'm not sure if it's because I ate outdoors under the sun but I didn't feel too good after this meal. The homemade meatballs were good. The croquettes were good. The fish sandwich - good at the first bite but then I realized how greasy it was. Overall it's a cute place but I'll need to try it again indoors with its rustic theme."]
201.Brooklyn Diner Times Square,[u'This place is nicer than I anticipated from the outside. There are mostly tourists here so if you are a tourist feel free to a top by the management and servers are friendly patient and accommodating. I was slightly surprised at the prices ($$$) but the chefs here delivered. We ordered from the brunch menu on a Sunday and got the Steak and eggs (perfectly cooked medium) with a side salad and the polenta cubes. Those whole fish was lovely. We also got the Brooklyn Diner cheeseburger and it was again cooked to perfection with a side serving of tasty French fries. \xa0 If I am generally not a fan of dining in the Times Square area too many tourists. But very glad we were hungry and stopped by here!' u"This place did the trick considering it was 6PM on Saturday and it was the only place without a wait. But also keep in mind that this was the only place in Times Square without a wait at 6PM on a Saturday. I can't say much about this place. It was a run of the mill diner. The food was pretty good even if they didn't give me a spoon to eat my chili with but whatever. What got me were the prices. The same chili for a small bowl was about $13. I get it's Times Square but that was just appalling to me. \xa0Oh and their menu is very limited. There were only really about 6 or 7 things on the menu." u'We ended up here as a result of being really hungry and it was raining. Looked kinda cool but mainly we wanted to get dry and fed.First point: Portions are TINY! Seriously Tiny! I wish I had pictures. When it arrived I had to really suppress the urge to ask why the portions were so small.Second point: Food was tasty but for the price should have been more. Third point: I would not seek this place out. I wouldn\'t say "Never eat here" but it would never get on my "Ooh I cant wait to eat there again sometime......" ever!!' u'I would have given 4 stars overall but i had to lower it because of the mosquito and fly buzzing around us as we dined late at night. \xa0As I went into yelp to find a place to eat late at night we stumbled upon this place since it was open and no line or wait time:Arugula salad - 4 stars - a light salad of arugula slices of orange avocado and tomatoes mixed with a sweet dressing. \xa0A nice light salad to start off with.Chicken pot pie - 4 stars - for about $24 it was a huge bowl that can at least feed 2 people. Love the crust with chunks of chicken peas beans and carrots.Chicken alfredo - 4 stars - \xa0for around $20 fat pasta with chicken and mushrooms mixed with a light alfredo sauce. Both dishes were really large so 4 of us could share the two plates with the salad.Service - 3 stars - \xa0we were greeted and seated right away but had to ask for utensils when they served our food since nothing was set. The waiter was very apologetic and explained that they were short-handed. This explained the slow service as well.Food and service were great however we were perplexed and disturbed how a fly (which we had to shoo away from our plates) and mosquito got into this diner for we had no problems inside or outside of nyc which forced my sons to leave the table and wait outside before paying our bill or become ravaged by the mosquito in the diner.' u'A friend and i stumbled in here while walking around times square and we were immediately super excited. As far as diners go this is nothing like we had ever seen. This looks like a beautiful restaurant with everything short of white table cloths. The best thing in the joint was without a doubt the polenta wedges. OHMYGOD. this is an Italian boys dream breakfast side. Do yourself a favor and go here.' u'It was an extreme struggle to get service here. No idea who the server was we had a few people randomly come by to help us. Should have been a warning sign when no one greeted us at the door or acknowledged that we walked in. Sadly the food did not make up for the poor service. Look elsewhere.' u'You haven\'t eaten all day are at Times Square New York \xa0so where do you go for dinner?We had just gotten up at 6am spent the day at the Statue of Liberty and the Ellis Island tour battling crowds of tourists the entire day with virtually no breakfast nor lunch and were starving and in no mood to wait around for a meal. \xa0We hopped off the subway at Times Square and headed for Brooklyn Diner Times Square.We go into the restaurant a typical NYC restaurant with large windows  low ceilings under bright ceiling lights covering diner booths and tables over a nice colored carpet. \xa0Clean cozy and noisy as you would expect.We are seated in one of those tables for 2 about 20" wide with similar tables on each side of us. \xa0The tables are so tight close together that the waiter has to move my chair out of the way and pull out the table for the wife to get in. Wife gets the booth seat on the inside and me on the chair outside. \xa0At our senior age the outside seats are preferable as there are no grab handles on the booth seats to pull yourself off the bathtub like sunken cushion. \xa0 Besides both tables on both sides of us have the female on the inside for me to check out! Brooklyn Diner Times Square is a chain restaurant with Brooklyn Diner\'s premiere dish its $23 chicken pot pie which I waste no time ordering while the wife gets the $22 Cuban chicken.Service is leisurely with us waiting at least 20 minutes for the order to arrive. \xa0But what would you expect with a chicken pot pie? \xa0I\'m the expert on chicken pies having eaten hundreds of them getting a head start when I was a latch key kid back in the 1960s cooking those $0.25 Banquet 8 oz meat pies graduating up to the $1.00 16 ounce Swanson meat pies and those frozen dudes took at least 40 minutes to bake.Meanwhile our neighbors are eating their $20+ deluxe hamburgers not the fat California kind but kind of like a quarter pounder staked in layers with guacamole bacon cheese like a totem pole -New York City style eatable only with a knife and fork.Our orders arrive and my wife is stunned speechless by the size of the chicken pie. \xa0It is oval shaped with a leaf symbol baked into the top of the crust and longer than my 10" butter knife! \xa0 The neighbors look at it and are also stunned by the size with the guy giving me a smile while saying \'Bon Appetite\' as if daring me to finish it. The pie is heaven to chicken pot pie lovers. \xa0Crust on the top crust on the sides and crust on the bottom perfectly cooked to a crisp but not overdone. \xa0Inside plentiful chunks of tender breast chicken together with potatoes carrots peas in a delicious creamy chicken broth sauce.The wife dug into her Cuban chicken -slices of chicken breast in a cilantro sauce with black beans rice and carmelized onions. \xa0Another delicious meal that she ate with no leftovers - a rarity as she doesn\'t usually eat that much. \xa0Personally I could do without the green cilantro sauce but I\'ve got my work cut out on the chicken pie. \xa0It takes me a good 20 minutes to eat the top crust and all the contents of the chicken pie leaving only slivers of crust glued to the bowl outside. \xa0I\'m eating like my cats at home head down taking bite after bite \xa0with my fork ploughing through the pie. \xa0This meal could feed three people but I eat it all to the amazement of the neighbors and the waiter expecting us to ask for a doggy bag like 99% of all the other people who order this dish. \xa0We did not order dessert and we got out of there after tip and tax for $55.99 and no I did not burb nor fart afterwards despite finishing off in one sitting the mother of all chicken pies!' u'Not sure how there are so many bad reviews mostly about the service? \xa0 We were greeted immediately upon entering and the gentleman who seated us was gracious and kind. Alfredo our server was AMAZING! \xa0He looks just a little like Obama!! \xa0 He was attentive kept my coffee filled & was very amenable to all of our requests. \xa0The food was tasty & hot and the orange juice was terrific. \xa0The ONLY complaint I have is about the price. \xa0I had to keep in mind we ARE in NY so everything is expensive but $80 for 3 for breakfast is a little over the top!' u'Great pre-theater option especially for the family. \xa0Burgers pasta salads. \xa0All good. \xa0Service is sensitive to your schedule. \xa0 Just steps from most of \xa0the theaters.' u'Horrible service.The smuggness of the woman that "greeted" us as we walked in was horrid making us feel like some homeless wandering in of the street because we were "surprise" visitors to the restaurant.We were seated quickly which is good... there is virtually no where to sit or stand while waiting making it I am sure uncomfortable to any diners seated near the front.Service was horribly slow taking a long time for the waiter to bring our waters and expresso. \xa0It took a long time for him to return to take our order and an even longer time for the order to be delivered; so long the wife wanted to just cancel and leave.Appallingly the waiter brought the order and told us they needed the table in twenty minutes. \xa0If they needed the table and had slow service why did they bother to seat us and simply state they had no room tonight?Well maybe... just maybe they\'ll figure it out at this mediocre restaruant based on the poor reviews and the one cent tip I left reflective of the quality service.' u"We were visiting New York for the weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were staying in Times Square. We decided to go to Brooklyn Diner. The host was extremely friendly and very catering. He brought us all champagne to celebrate her birthday and also brought her a cheesecake with strawberries for dessert. The food was excellentvery filling and we had a great experience. If you are in New York just remember to make reservations everywhere is always so crowded. But they still seated us relatively quick." u'We were starving from walking around New York City all day. \xa0Found this diner. \xa0Service was good. \xa03 out of 4 of us got the hamburger meal. \xa0It was with French fries. \xa0Decent. My one son got the hot Dog which was enormous-be prepared (see picture). \xa0The price was outrageous in my opinion. \xa0Bill was Well over 100$ and we drank water had no appetizers or dessert. Food- decent. atmosphere- fun. \xa0Service-good. \xa0Price - Expensive!!!!!' u'Wanted to treat myself to a special birthday lunch. Due to reviews decided to try this place. Food was delicious. Calamari came with a spicy sauce rather than normal marinara sauce. Salmon burger best I have ever tasted. I was so full but wanted to try a dessert. Fudge sundae was like others nothing special. Waitress Kathryn was very attentive. Highly recommend.' u'The atmosphere and food is great! I have many allergies and this diner was one of the few that was able to accommodate me - gluten free bread used no butter on my eggs or bread. The wait staff is all very nice and helpful. We spent 5 mornings eating breakfast while visiting NYC and we ate here 4 of the 5 days!' u'Best chicken parmesan ever! I really loved the atmosphere here. Classic Diner with great service' u'Our \xa0waiter was extremely nice. We had the Brooklyn burger and it was so tasty. \xa0I am sorry i was so full and could not try the dessert. \xa0The prices are normal for NY' u'As soon me and my friend walked in we were greeter very nicely and sat down quick..The food was really good.. I had the drench toast yummmmGeneral manager Richard Sanchez was very attentive to our table and he made us laugh..We had a great time this morning for bkfast I will go again' u"So I agree with Jay K I don't know why such a low score? \xa0Perhaps it's because people are expecting a true diner vs an upscale diner? \xa0One can only say - I had great service & great food! \xa0This was actually. Welcome dinner tonight being here for work means lunches and dinners in the office. \xa0The bacon cheeseburger was spot on and the fries were great - and I'm not a fry guy! \xa0I brought back to the room the house dessert of noodle kugel made into an amazing sundae! \xa0I think everyone should try this place when in the city!" u"*Yes I am a tourist but that doesn't mean that I have things to say*My mom and I looked for a place to eat that is local and away from the people in Time Square. So we found Brooklyn Diner.We went in and it seems to be semi fancy but casual which I don't mind at all (and it reminded me of a restaurant back home).Although I wanted to try there local beer their draft beer broke down so I had to ordered bottle beer which its not a problem at all.The food was the best thing I've ever had! I ordered Chinese Chicken Salad that looks authentic and has a lot of flavors that my mouth enjoyed the savoring taste. My mom has the Chicken Milanese and she said it was super good that I shared a piece and it was crunchy on the outside and very savoring!Waiters and I think the lady is a manager or something were very friendly and checking on us to make sure we're okay.Although it was pricey don't matter because its one of our best lunch ever." u"I visited the restaurant at about 5:30 on a Monday night and ordered basic fare - cheeseburger malt fries. The cheeseburger was quite good though it was delivered with the tomato I had asked to be left off. The malt was awful basically chocolate milk and some whipped cream half froth not at all the hand-made malted milk that I think I had a right to expect. The fries might have been alright delivered hot but were not. Seasoned fries - some like 'em some don't. The service was indifferent. I won't go back."]
2.Carmine’s,[u"Portions are huge! Beware! Other than that enjoy your food! They're really yummy!!Went there twice. The first time our food was a bit too salty for our taste BUT the second everything was great!We went as a huge group since the portions were huge. Both times the staff was really friendly. The setting is kinda loud but if it doesn't bother you you're fine. Not a good place for a romantic dinner lol" u"Haven't been here in years and even though it used to be one of my favorite restaurants it was very disappointing. \xa0It's not great going with just 2 people to begin with because of the humongous portions but my sweetie and I decided to just take home the leftovers after we saw the Hamilton matinee on Saturday. \xa0Yes the play is as good and even better than the hype! \xa0It was AMAAAZING!Now for the food review: \xa0We ordered the chicken wings scarpiello for appetizer and those were terrific - 4 stars. \xa0Our main course was veal parm over rigatoni and boy was that awful - zero stars! \xa0I must have still been in the afterglow of Hamilton because I didn't do what I generally would have done which is to send it back. \xa0Either that or I am losing it. \xa0The veal breading was a blob of mush with a slab of mozzarella on top of it and it seems that it was not fried enough or that it was fried and then sat around under sauce so it got very soggy. HATED IT. \xa0The wings were so good that they made up for the zero stars of the veal parm and the real score here is about a 2 1/2 star rating.Bottom line go somewhere else. \xa0Tony's Di Napoli which I previously never gave enough credit to is definitely better by a long shot." u"Despite the 1.5 hour long wait it was totally worth it. Carmines is the top of the top when it comes to family style restaurants. The interior offers a romantic setting perfect for a date night. The setting also is perfectly appropriate for a family function as they have an upstairs with more space for bigger crowds.The hostess was awesome keeping my party informed of any wait issues and times.They offered for us to go sit at the bar and have some drinks so we did just that. A nice long bar new york style at its best. The bartenders on the top of their game making sure every person there is served promptly and professionally. Huge wine and beer assortment lots of liquor as well. I myself am a cranberry and vodka girl.We were seated in the back underneath pictures of old new york city little italy and some famous actors and actresses.We started out with fried calamari (does it get more italian than that?) which was to die for. perfectly battered and seasoned crisp and light the marinara that was paired with it was homemade and unbelievably delicious. I thought does it get better than this? Well it does!!Please keep in mind carmines is a family style restaurant so the portions are huge perfect to share.We got penne alla vodka the rigatoni bolognese shrimp fra diavolo and the spinach for a side.Holy cow i know i said it was for family but im not kidding all three of those dishes were for my party of 10 and we were more than satisfied.The vodka sauce was one of a kind perfectly prepared not too creamy like some can get. The pasta cooked to perfection. The meat sauce (bolognese) has such a perfect variety of meat the rigatoni noodles were huge! The shrimp fra diavolo was spicy i got heartburn soon after but it was sooo worth it. My only gripe is i wish it had more shrimp for the family serving that it was it kind of lacked.Honestly i loved my experience at carmines. I was told they have thanksgiving and christmas menu's catered to the day so im booking my reservation now for thanksgiving. a turkey meal from carmines?! YASSS.If youre in the theater district and just watched a show and your craving some awesome italian food this is the place to be!!" u'Nothing special about this place; family size dishes very crowded average customer service is all I can tell about this place; there are lots of other options available in New York that have way better quality of food and service. The price is also on the higher side again not worth paying to eat in this place; I think the location is what they are getting the advantage of; will definitely not go back.' u'Well what can I say? This is the "infamous" Carmine\'s lol I came here only once before this visit in my life time haha It\'s a restaraunt more for tourists rather than NYC regulars- in my opinion. I mean don\'t get me wrong if I had the money to splurge and I was waltzing around manahhattan just for kicks with a few people- I\'d definitely make a stop in here. So I came here with a group of 12 because of a recent event at Madison square garden. This is a family style restaraunt so all the food portions are for sharing between a few people. I\'m gonna say 4 people should be the minimum of what you attend here with lol The food is absolutely delicious! You definitely get what you pay for! We had reservations which is what I highly recommend you doing before showing up here. It\'s insanely busy at no matter what time or day! So call a head of time and plan this out. I\'m sure you can walk in and wait for a table as well- I just wouldn\'t do that though personally you might be waiting a while. The service was great! Even though it was so busy we never had a problem getting anything we requested for the table. And like I said the food was delicious! Had stuffed artichokes salad penne pasta spaghetti with meatballs and chicken parmigiana. Had a little bit of everything and I left here feeling like I was going to explode haha But it was so worth it! \xa0Love the atmosphere too and it\'s got plenty of seating room! So many tables and space. I highly recommend this place if you are planning on heading out to dinner with a large group of people and are in the Manhattan area!' u'Nothing remarkable. Decent food. Family style. $160 for 4 people with 1 app 1 salad \xa0& 1 entree.Calamari was fantastic!! Mixed greens salad was ok. Chicken parm was disappointing - tough overly pounded flat chicken breast made to look bigger than it was. It was good but not a place I would look to return. Plenty of other options in New York.' u"WOW! The wait was 1.5 hrs long but I kept seeing random groups of 2 come in and just sit down without going to check in and of course were served right away. That was very enraging but if people were willing to wait I figured this was going to be good.We finally sat down and was asked if we wanted water... I knew immediately this place was like Europe by just looking around and when asked about water you have to specify tap water or you get the expensive bottled water that tastes exactly the same as tap water. Unfortunately I was not paying attention and my friend who didn't know this just said yes to water. It ended up being $8 and we got 2 more tap water jugs after.We were warned that portions were big but my friend really wanted calamari and chicken Parmesan with pasta. No kidding. The calamari alone was enough to fill the 3 of us. Mind you we tend to eat a lot but even this was just too much! And once we started getting full the chicken parm comes out... This could've fed 6-7 people! Omg it was huge. Overall calamari was on point. Chicken Parmesan was nothing special. So I was pretty happy and very stuffed after this meal. Not to mention none of my friends could take the leftovers so I got it all meaning it fed me for at least 3 more meals.With larger portion sizes means larger price tags. Plates ranged from $25-35. It was definitely expensive and I felt like we paid more for the decor atmosphere and portion size less of the food quality. With that said quality wasn't horrible but definitely not the best I've had. I enjoyed everything would return with a bigger group in the future." u"I MUST RETURN !! \xa0This restaurant is ALWAYS packed with people and the wait is sooo long. All the reviews speak of how long the wait is and how great the food are. I definitely wanted to try this place.I came here during the lunch time AND NO WAIT! YES! YES! YES! I had to wait for the waiter to set up the table and that was it. I was super happy and could not wait to try this place. Carmine's definitely do not disappoint. All there dishes are meant to be family size so they are HUGE. DO NOT think about ordering an entire dish for yourself because you will not be able to eat anything else. One dish can feed around 3+ people. Order wisely. I came with a party of seven ordered five dishes two appetizers and three entrees and we could not finish! My co-worker ended up taking the one entire dish home. We ordered calamari chicken parm penne la vocka seafood linguini and a spinach. The calamari is a MUST MUST GET. You will not regret it. I know I said you will not be able to finish one entire plate by yourself but calamari... I definitely can finish the entire thing myself. It is THAT awesome. It is really something to rave about. The really liked the penne la vocka and the chicken parm as well. I would order those again. The seafood linguini was a bit too blend for me and the noodle was too hard for my liking but my coworker loved it. The spinach was really salty for me so I didn't really get to eat that either. However all the other food and the experience definitely made up for it. Nonetheless they have so many different types of bread in the beginning. The garlic bread is the best one and the pizza bread (yes they have pizza bread) comes second. I am coming back here with no doubt!" u"This is not the place to bring a large group ever. Carmine's is great downstairs for 4-6 people who want to experience shared food on large plates. This location is not setup to handle larger groups though. We booked a reservation for 35 which required that we sign a contract and pay for a guaranteed amount of food off a ridiculously overpriced prix fixe menu ($70 a person without drinks or tip). Our contract called for a private room and wait staff. What we got was shared seating in the upstairs dining room being served by the same staff as everyone else. We had one waiter assigned to keep 35 people happy (use your imagination to see how that went). The group menu requires that everyone eat the same dishes and wastes food when people don't care for something that had to be ordered ahead of time (and they bring out way too much food for the group in every course). Everyone did get fed. And like idiot tourists we opened our wallets and paid for the experience near Times Square but do yourself a favor and take your group elsewhere or break them up into smaller groups to sit downstairs and enjoy the experience (and price)." u"so.... to add insult to injury paul here- see photo- someone who has zero followers and also appears to be connected to carmine's sent me this message. true indication as to why if you're in nyc theater district and you need a restaurant- an italian one- avoid carmines at all costs. this is exactly the type of people that are there. see photo with paul d's private comment to me. hey paul- who is the idiot now???" u"I love love love Carmine's. My mom has been coming to New York for 30 years for business and it's still one of the places we have to go whenever she's in town from Texas. It was very crowded on a Wednesday night but luckily there was only 3 of us and we were able to find a spot at the bar. The bar keep is hilarious and gives a generous pour. They have 10 oz pours of wine from $12-20 depending on the wine. We always have to order the garlic bread even though they give you 9 huge pieces. It's perfectly gooey and crispy at the same time. Of course we couldn't eat it all so we ended up sharing the bread with the people around us. We also ordered the Carmine's special salad. It is kind of like a Greek salad but with a lot more salami and cheese. I definitely recommend ordering this dish because we practically licked the plate clean. We ordered the penne sausage and broccoli pasta dish. The red sauce is a little spicy so it's a good compliment to the sausage. We really tried to eat it all but we just couldn't. Is this place touristy? Yes. Are there better Italian places in Manhattan? Yes. The point is you go for the experience and you have an amazing time. That's why we keep coming back." u'Mamma Mia! The family-style Italian cuisine at Carmine\'s Restaurant is truly meant for sharing with friends or family. Each plate of food is big enough for 4-6 people to share with prices to match the bounty. This is homestyle Italian dining and not necessarily the best date spot unless you both can eat a ton of food and like the exact same things. Luckily my wife and I fall into that category.As we began to plow through the complimentary bread and a couple small glasses of Peppoli 2013 Chianti from Italy our waiter balked when we ordered the Hot Antipasto appetizer ($33.95) AND the Porterhouse Steak ($84.95). He repeated over and over again "there\'s no way you can finish it." He was almost right. Almost.The Hot Antipasto Platter had EIGHT (Otto) different delicious appetizers including: * Broccoli Rabe with Sausage * Capellini Pie * Lamb Meatballs * Zuppa de Mussels * Eggplant Rollatini  * Baked Arancini  * Stuffed Mushrooms * and what appeared to be Baked Clams Oreganata with BaconIt\'s a great way to share and taste a lot of flavors. Bring friends ... or not.And then it was time for the huge 42-ounce Porterhouse Steak delicately sliced off the bone and served with mouthwatering medium-rare pinkness. This huge slab of meat was surprisingly tender and juicy ... and the best part of our feast. I don\'t know if Italy is famous for their steaks but Carmine\'s should be famous for the Broiled Porterhouse Steak. Did we eat it all? Oh you bet we did! The huge family-style dishes and fascinating flavors of Carmine\'s will add pounds and memories to your New York vacation while leaving you and your diet shouting in unison "Mamma Mia!"' u"I've heard great things about Carmine's . So when I was taken there by a friend I was pretty excited . We came on a weekday around 7 and it was crowded . Since it was only the two of us the wait was about 10 minutes . We got seating upstairs which was beautiful . The menu was on the wall. They don't give out book menus there . Which I found ridiculous honesty . Our seat was so far from the menu we had to physically get up to go look  plus my eyes aren't good and I didn't have my glasses that day. So that aspect of the restaurant is really annoying . The complimentary bread was delicious  especially the ones with the toppings. Our entree was delicious  it was the special of the night . The entrees are very big and are shared  can feed between 3-5 people . I got a glass of wine for $10.00 . The glass was so small  not worth it honestly . Our waiter was a friendly guy and check up on us often . Overall the food is what's most important and I can honestly say I enjoyed it very much and it tasted really delicious and authentic ." u"I have been waiting to come back to Carmine's for years and I'm sad to say that I left the restaurant feeling somewhat disappointed. I don't know if it's the quality of the food that has changed over time or if my taste buds have evolved but I remember it as being so much better when I was a child. Of course seeing the lines and the reviews here I want to say that they are more in line with what I thought when I was younger but my own experience was disappointing.Along with the fact that the food was average I was not very pleased with the service. Our waiter kept pushing us to order more when it was clear that we would not be able to finish the number of entrees that he was suggesting. He kept speaking to us in a somewhat condescending manner. When we were already stuffed to the brim and decided to order the Titanic dessert he asked if we wanted two of them. Sure we were a large group but we already had food leftover from dinner and none of us could eat more than just a few bites. He kept insisting that we were stretching it for twelve people but we told him that we would start it off with this much before moving forward with another order. The pushiness did not make me feel comfortable at all in trusting his recommendations.In addition they kept trying to clear off our table before we were finished eating. Many times they would reach out to clear the plates when there was still food on it and I had to stop them several times to let them know that I was still working on it. Of course I understand efficiency but I would also like to feel like I'm not being rushed to finish my food. Sadly I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon. :(" u"Went to Times Square to get last minute Broadway show tickets. That didn't happen but we ended up at Carmine's. Didn't have a reservation so we're told a minimum 1 hour wait. We got seated in about 40 minutes. This was a busy Sunday night so the quick service was appreciated. It was an early anniversary celebration. Our staff was helpful and pleasant. We ordered the fish dish and a penne pasta in marinara sauce with veggies. Both were amazing.The portion sizes are huge. We got no appetizers 2 entree dishes and no desserts for 4 adults and we couldn't finish." u"My wife loves this place. \xa0 My kids seem ok with it but why only three stars? \xa0I guess I expected more out of the place. It really didn't seem to special to me. \xa0 Maybe because I was far away from home I don't know. \xa0 The night wasn't exactly ruined but to be honest I couldn't enjoy the food well. \xa0The table next to my family with 11 and 9 year old children was packed with a bunch of loud and seemingly drunk bros. \xa0Look I'm all for having a good time but maybe the ma\xee tre d should've considered sitting us a little further apart? \xa0 I don't know. \xa0 I mean I only paid a couple of hundred dollars which may not be a lot but I've spent 40 dollars at family restaurants and had a way better time and enjoyed the experience way better because of ambience.The food was ok. \xa0 The spaghetti and meatballs was not offensive. \xa0We had a shrimp dish but I didn't enjoy the shrimp. \xa0Maybe my palate isn't mature enough to enjoy it? \xa0 My wife loved that dish in particular. \xa0Think we also had some type of steak but since I can't quite remember it wasn't that good. We had a desert and it was very large but it wasn't something I could remember anything about. \xa0I was there less than a month ago if it was great. \xa0It would've stuck.If you need to eat somewhere iconic I guess this is the place to go. \xa0If you just wanted a nice night with your family not sure if I could put this on top of my list. \xa0 Sorry for the four stars if anything our waitress was nice cool and professional" u"If you are 2 people don't come here unless you want food for 6. The portions are huge and family style. Not a small plate spot. The service was something not good not great not very helpful. I didn't like the spaghetti and my salad was not fresh. I would never recommend this place to my worst enemy to be honest." u"Some friends and I were looking for an Italian place to meet up. The question one of us asked was is Carmine's still good? \xa0The answer is YES! \xa0The stuffed mushrooms seafood pasta with angel hair and broiled porterhouse steak were delicious! \xa0There was so much food left over we had to take it home. \xa0I was secretly glad we had leftovers because lunch the next day was delizioso!Great place for catching up with friends family style." u"What can I write about Carmine's that hasn't been written already? \xa0Probably nothing. But I do want to acknowledge a phenomenal server by the name of Yves. My colleagues and I were sat on the second floor near the window overlooking 44th. The place was packed and tables were constantly turning. Yves greeted us in a timely manner and quickly got us started with some Pellegrino bread and a bottle of Duckhorn Cab. It was our first time here so we decided to have Yves take care of our order. Here's the breakdown:Caesar Salad - pretty standard but there is definitely a hint of anchovy in there perhaps scratch made?Salmon Casino - special for the night. Served with mussels and clams. Pretty good. Rigatoni Sausage Broccoli - self explanatory. Very simple rustic dish that does the job. Tiramisu - standard fare. Definitely wouldn't hurt to give this a try. Carmine's seems to be a place that's always busy for dinner. I don't know how the servers do it and still have a smile on their face! \xa0Yves knocked it out of the park. \xa0It was a relief to not have to worry about dinner and just focus on our discussion. \xa0My colleagues and I were able to enjoy dinner but also finish some work as well. If you're looking for a stress-free dining experience then ask for Yves. Best decision you'll make all day..." u'This review is based on my take-out experience Very inclusive may need update in the future.Location: Carmine is on west 44th street between 7th and 8th Ave 400 yards away from the Junior restaurant. It seems to be the icon restaurant in Time Square due to its large portion size of food and tons of yelp reviews. I am not an Italian food fan because the food can be greasy and fulfilling which made my stomach very uncomfortable if i ate it. But I still want to risk my chance to experience some good food. So this Saturday night I ordered their fried zucchini to take-out.Food: fried zucchini cane very greasy and uncomfortable to me. The batter which covered the zucchini is too much so that it covered the flavor of zucchini through every bite..And the slice of zucchini is too thin to even test the zucchini ...what a "great" zucchini fries.. I had so many better expereicen and this is not one of them or even close.Service: 10 mins for the appetizer ...Price: 23 dollar for the huge portion of zucchini fries which apparent was not worth any penny and I threw away most of it...Overall: tourists place.. Do\'t go.']
66.Galbi Q,[u"Can I give this guy 6 stars? That seriously hit the spot. One of the best bulgogis I've had with a sunny side egg salad Kim chi and dumplings for ten dollars?!! I should've ordered two. It started raining when I ordered so I took it back to the hotel but now I am sad Coz I want more!Two days left in nyc. Definitely going back!" u"One of the best $12 i have spent!!Galbi rice green salad vegetable dumplings kimchi and a fried egg. Decent size portion and yummy food at a cheap price!! The guy was very nice and polite. Today was slightly raining and when he saw i was using a cane he asked me to wait by the building and even brought the food to me so I wouldn't get wet. I wish him the best." u"Wonderful food wonderful service. There is plenty of food truck competition in the area but this might be the best I've had yet. There was no line at all today because many people have taken off for the holiday weekend. I'm glad I tried it and will gladly wait in line for lunch. I chose the bulgogi which was the best I've had. It was served with kimchi two vegetable dumplings and a side salad. It was wonderful. I loved the hot sauce. The owner was delightful and engaged in conversation while he prepared my food. I will certainly return!" u'Great food for a very reasonable price. For $8 I got two scoops of rice a generous serving of bulgogi some kimchi a decent sized green salad and two vegetable dumplings. The couple working the cart are really sweet helpful and quick. The bulgogi was tasty but could definitely have used a little bit more spice the vegetable dumplings were delicious and the salad was fresh and more than just a garnish! For a few dollars more than a Halal cart and a few dollars less than a trendy taco truck you get a very fresh and tasty meal. A superb option for lunch!' u"I really wanted to give this place 1 star. You know why? Because it's absolutely delicious and the best food around--and I don't want everyone to start going! But in the end yes yes you should go! The food is amazing the wife husband team working it are SO nice and SO accommodating. I really hate food trucks they gross me out but this one is different. It's just amazing!! Highly recommend!!!!" u'Ordered bulgogi from here once. Reasonable price and tasted good. The owner was very friendly.' u"They get an extra star for a perfectly made sunny side up egg crunchy on the bottom and runny up top while the whites are just solid. Service is good husband and wife team are very nice but they do take their time to ensure the order is made properly I don't mind the wait but some maybe in a rush.Bulgogi was a bit dry it was made per order it would be better but the wait would be incredibly longso it looks like the meat is pre cooked and then heated to service.Portions are good I was left very full but not so much that I fall asleep at the desk. Come try it out they make a nice plate with several sides." u'Run by a husband and wife team. They are warm and friendly. Had the Galbi which was delicious and the gentleman made it not too spicy. Will be back to try other dishes. Next time will order with the egg on top.' u"The couple who works here are sweethearts! I've never had Korean food before but this definitely made me fall in love the Galbi is always delicious. I haven't had their ramen but that's next.." u'This is some of the best Korean food I have had. I go here during my lunch break. Very reasonably priced and you can tell the owner really cares about the food. Definitely a spot to check out!' u"Great Lunch spot after gym. Reasonable price and delicious food! Waiting kind of long during lunch hour if you don't mind" u"Visiting NY from CA. I love Korean food and for a street cart this was up there with some of the best I've had! Huge portions and friendly service. Owner said he just started the cart last month I hope he does well because his food is awesome! Had the bulgogi plate. Came with white rice kimchi two veggie gyoza (dumplings) a small salad and my favorite the pickled radish and carrots! His prices are very fare for the amount of food you get. The average plate is around $8...if you like Korean food this place was awesome!" u'Delicious- cold rainy day and headed back to my hotel- craving some hot delicious food in an area that has mostly mediocre food at best (midtown near time square) asked what was best and was not lead astray - told "Galbi of course but it is more expensive". - $11 for a good lunch?! \xa0No problem! \xa0Eat here and get the galbi- you won\'t be disappointed!' u'The bugolgi ($9) was very tender and the red sauce they put on it was very unique and tastes awesome! The order comes with a bit of kimchi pickled carrots & radishes a salad with a balsamic vinagrette and 2 vege dumplings-- pretty good variety and quantity of food for the price even though it used to be a dollar cheaper. I see in the reviews you can get an egg! I will have to ask about that next time...']
188.The Perfect Pint,[u'Great beer selection for a disgusting lush like myself (have you tried Guiness yet? It\'s amazing!)While you\'re there try a Kilkenny Irish Creme Ale you won\'t regret it (like that one time you paid hard-earned money for a Creed album in the 90\'s.)Nachos were decent although kinda greasy but hey - it\'s an "Irish" pub not some spicy Mexican joint y\'knowhatI\'msayin????Upon entering (or ordering you\'re 13th beer) you may be greeted with an Irish accent but don\'t let that fool you. This place is as authentic as Monopoly money. Fun place to stop while you\'re in Manhattan especially if you\'re an annoying tourist or some random A-hole in town for business.Cheers!Yeeeaaassseeeeeaaahhhhh!!!!!' u"This is a great spot to grab a drink in debatably one of the worst places in the city to want to do anything...Times Square. This place is a bit of positive light in a sea of tourist ridden pubs and chains that surround it. The best part is the upstairs rooftop patio where you can come and enjoy a beer outside. The beer list is awesome. Probably close to 30 drafts on the menu. Servers are quick and attentive and also look out for you. We walked in and they conveniently moved a party of 2 to a smaller table so they could take care of our table of 5. It was super nice of them and I could see that they did right by the other table of 2 and made sure they weren't putting them out. It was great. This is a place I would definitely recommend if you're in the Times Square area have to have drinks around here. It's a gem in the otherwise bar nonsense." u"Love the rooftop here! I try to avoid this area because Times Square is so awful but met up with a friend here for drinks/dinner. I would definitely recommend coming here if you find yourself in Times Square - a block away from the hustle and bustle and relatively quiet. Unless you're looking for a workout - I recommend taking the elevator to the rooftop!Huge selection of beers (although no Abita or Tyskie my two favorites!) and I had a yummy chicken quesadilla. Service was alright kind of hard to get our waitress's attention and she forgot to bring me water that I ordered but it was pretty busy so I understand. Probably a fun place to go watch a game!" u"My friend and I came here for our last drink before leaving NYC. Two stars are for the beer I got - some grapefruit flavored beer that was delicious. Being on the rooftop was fun but there isn't really any view except for the buildings surrounding us. We also ordered nachos to munch on but the chili was extremely spicy so we never finished it. Last thing the waitress took my card when we ordered drinks to start my tab charged my card for my tab and then handed me someone else's card for me to sign for. I didn't notice she switched the cards until I got back to my hotel room so I had to order a replacement. Make sure you check that you're signing for the right card before going home! I probably wouldn't come back except to find out what that beer was called." u'An excellent place to have a drink or dinner. Food was delicious perfect temperature and more than 40 kinds of beers. Service was exceptional and the rooftop has a very chilly environment!!!!' u"I've been to this specific location on two occasions. Once last year during the summer for a friend's birthday HH on the roof and again recently for a midweek power lunch with an old coworker. Both experiences were great in my opinion!The rooftop is a nice spot to hang out during the warmer months especially if you get there early enough to get a table and some seats. I think the specials were pretty good. I happen to remember a delicious grapefruit beer that sounds quite good right about now... Anyway! So yes I'm looking forward to meeting up with friends there this summer again.I was really happy to try the food from here because I had never had it before. And let me tell you it was pretty good. I ordered the turkey cuban sandwich with fries and I was more than happy with my meal. The prices were what you'd expect from a bar in the Times Square area and the service was great.I know I said this already but definitely looking forward to visiting this establishment again!PS: There are a LOT of stairs here so beware of that... :)" u"Came here by chance when dinner plans fell through and was crazing English style food. The service was great as well as the food. Exactly what I was expecting. Managed a good table upstairs but was very noisy because of a big group of business men. However one doesn't exactly expect to go to a pub and expect a quiet atmosphere." u"Came here on a whim and sat at the 2nd floor area. Can't really say much about the food because I only ordered the fried calamari and 2 IPAs. I didn't get it but they had the Guinness nitro IPA. Props! They also have a good/wide selection of beer on tap so it'll satisfy all beer lovers. The fried calamari wasn't anything out of the ordinary. But it wasn't overly salty and bland so in that aspect it was a thumbs up! Perhaps slightly less in amount than I would have expected but oh well. My friends had 2 of their burgers and they seemed to like it. Service was good but nothing exceptional. The lady was nice and attentive." u"Another typical pub in midtown but with a rooftop! It's only on the fourth floor in the middle of the street so diner expect great views but it's always nice to get fresh air. They have a lot of options on tap! But beer was served in plastic cups so that was a little disappointing.Even though it was packed (5pm Friday night) the waitress got the orders quickly and drinks and food were out in no time. *A lot of the HH specials don't apply if you're on the rooftop" u"Wow. Service here is pretty terrible. I love the location on the east side and this place could be just as great but not so much. Sat at the bar with empty glasses for more than 5 minutes without any attention from the bartender. And it wasn't even busy. Hopefully they'll get their act together and focus more on service." u'Great roof top bar to get out of the crowd at Times Square. Great selection of beer food was okay. We had the nachos and they were average. Better for atmosphere/location than food.' u'We ended up at The Perfect Pint for lunch on the last day of our trip to NYC. Such a perfect lunch spot...loved it! I had the Grilled Portobello Sandwich which is a \xa0Grilled Portobello Mushroom Fresh Mozzarella Roasted Red Peppers Basil Pesto Mayo Balsamic Glaze on Ciabatta Bread. It was delicious. I ate the whole thing. I\'m such a fat kid. My guy had the "Incredible Lamb Burger" Laced with Fresh Herbs & Spices Pepper-Jack Cheese with Tzatziki Sauce. He said it was one of the best lamb burgers he\'s had. The fries are on point. They aren\'t those little stringy ass things. Nice perfect fries --- in-between a steak fry and the little skinny ones. The service was spot on. Our server was awesome. We were in/out within an hour on a Monday at lunchtime. Perfect!' u'I am a good patron to have. I am. I don\'t sweat the small stuff and am a generous tipper. Having said that carmelized onions are NOT small stuff. Carmelized onions are golden-brown and delicious. In fact carmelization is a basic process with a very clear and simple concept: cooking the sugars till they\'re nice and brown. So when you say "carmelized onions" I do not expect lighly sauteed onions. I expect carmelized golden onions. In fact this is why I ordered your Gaelic burger to begin with. I am not even docking them any stars for a well-done burger instead of a medium-well. I get it. Food may cook while being delivered. But there is NO WAY carmelized onions would turn into sauteed onions because of traffic weather delivery - really pick any reason. You can turn sauteed onions into carmelized but not the other way around. Nor will they continue cooking like a steak or hamburger will once you stop cooking them. This is NOT a small thing. It\'s a major one. If you feel I was too harsh think again. The fish in the fish and chips was clammy and the burger overcooked - that said I do understand that both those issues may have been because neither of those items deliver well. BUT THE ONIONS?!?!?' u"Came here with a friend for a meal since I was a tad hungry. \xa0I'm not sure how the drinks are but the food was not great cuisine or anything fancy. \xa0Staff was very friendly and we did get to sit someplace relatively quiet but I wouldn't come here for the food. \xa0You're also in the midst of tourist land here though there was ample seating later on a weeknight & it wasn't a packed madhouse. \xa0Maybe you should just come for the drinks and the service." u"I might be biased on my review because I am used to good cocktails bars that make good drinks and a bartender who knows his alcohol. I understand this is a sports bar and cocktails probably aren't their expertise. But its good to ask your customers how the drink is made if you don't know or just let them know you can't make what they are looking for.I stopped by the Perfect Pint briefly for a drink with few coworkers on a Thursday night. We sat on their rooftop and enjoyed the beautiful summer breeze. I must say the ambience at the rooftop is very pleasant and we had no difficulty getting a table there for our big group. But everything went down hill when I got a mixture of red wine vermouth and ice for my order of the NY sour. There was no taste of Whiskey there was so seperation of red wine from the rest of the drink I still do not know what to call it." u'Great spot in midtown! Love the roof top bar and as crazy as it gets the service is always top notch! As soon as your drink is empty there is a waitress or bartender there to refill your glass! The food here is pretty amazing I recommend the nachos and southwest spring rolls! So good!' u"There are several locations of the perfect pint but in my experience they're pretty similar. It's a casual environment with lots of space but my favorite area is the rooftop. That being said there are multiple floors of indoor seating. Come here for wine or beer and to catch up with a small group of friends. Their happy hour included several beers for $5 each and everything comes in a plastic cup. They'll also give you complimentary water which is essential during these hot summer months. Outside you can find outlets to charge your phone with and the waitstaff are very attentive to your needs. I enjoy coming here and never feel like I'm being rushed or crowded." u'Perfect location nice roof top bar! Of course the beer was good ;)The only thing what bothered me: had to wait for a waiter and when I asked "is that xyz beer a lager or ale" she said "yea it\'s a beer" -.-' u"I really just don't like this bar. Average Guinness and sports bar/club feel at night. Not really a pub as much as a place that caters to drunk tourists. My family loves the rooftop patio I find it...meh. Not the perfect pint but will do in a pinch. It's pretty standard for Midtown Irish American bars." u"Hard to believe that this is a great place if you're looking for some respite from the zoo that is Times Square to enjoy a fine selection of brews and decent bar food."]
194.Braai,[u"Good diverse food nice atmosphere low prices Came here for a casual dinner on Thursday night. Liked casino yet stylish interior good vibe. The menu was diverse with multiple meat seafood and vegetarian options. We ordered ostrich sliders (good!) lamp chops (great) corn (great) coconut palenta (good) and lobster salad (okay I wouldn't order it again). Staff was attentive.I'd come back try more things!" u'I had been wanting to give Braai a try for a while (I live around the corner) so finally pulled the trigger on a Sunday brunch date. The food was great however the service was not. Our waitress was slow and barely spoke despite it not being very busy but no big deal. What was a big deal is that my date and I both asked for "a glass" of sangria. We were not looking to get hammered. As expected we both were served one glass each. The bill came and we saw we were charged with the unlimited brunch drinks--19$ each. We asked if we could be charged by the glass given we only had one each. The waitress replied that they only do unlimited drinks and it was already entered in the system. OK; it would have been nice if the waitress had made that clear when we asked for "a glass of sangria" and not "we\'ll do the unlimited sangria." I countered with a very reasonable request to void one of the two charges so we were still paying 19$ for two glasses of sangria. A fair compromise. She declined--"it can\'t be voided." Apparently only a manager can void items so I asked for a manager. She informed that there was no manager present. How can you not have a manager available?!Great food but I do not appreciate being ripped off; I will not return due to the service.' u"After a long trek up to Columbia in the morning and a sturdy craving for a more interesting brunch I found myself stumbling back down the island and into Braii - well outside of Braii having chosen to adopt an outside table over sitting inside with a large raucous party if 20 or so. I'm not a stranger to the solo brunch (or solo dining) so I appreciate any restaurant that doesn't have servers give me a look of pity when I say no I am not waiting for anyone else. I ordered ostrich Benedict to be adventurous and while ostrich may not become my favorite meat choice I found the dish to be flavorful and cooked well. The side potato has was also rather good and the bread was a nice touch to hold me over for my meal. I took a glance at the dessert menu and resisted but the options seems enticing and well reviewed. Overall ostrich Benedict is worth a try but if you're not adventurous you may not enjoy the taste. Service was good restaurant didn't take terribly long to bring my food out and the location is convenient - 51st just past Maria Pia and Ippudo. Would frequent again if in the area." u'My last meal in NYC was such a disappointment mostly because of the terrible service. I thought New York restaurants want you in and out? Apparently this isn\'t the case at Braai.Came here for brunch right when they opened. I\'m not sure why the service was so slow when they weren\'t very busy. I ordered the "Huguenot Toast" aka French toast for brunch. It took a good 30-40 minutes before it came out and it was cold. For $12 this was also the smallest portion of French toast that I\'ve ever been served. The bread must be tiny! They were also quite stingy on the rooibos syrup.Lastly they advertise that this dish comes with fresh fruit. Well I sorta expected something more substantial than 2 strawberries (sliced thinly) and 5 blueberries.I\'m not a big eater by an means so I was disappointed and left hungry. What irked me the most about Braai was how difficult it was to grab someone\'s attention. They just kind of looked at you went back to doing what they were doing and if you were lucky come over 5 minutes later.' u'Brunch with the option of $12 unlimited mimosas is pretty much guaranteed to be a win. Because even though it\'s considered bad form to drink a lot before noon that rule doesn\'t apply to Sundays. I think it says that somewhere in the Bible. Obviously the mimosas were not very strong and I would have liked the option to choose which variety of "exotic juice" I got. On top of that the service was kind of iffy which may have been by design but I still had like six glasses I think?One shouldn\'t drink on an empty stomach so I ordered the "vertkoek met mince" which basically equaled a South African sloppy joe. I highly recommend it. Flavorful meat with what seemed to be bits of carrot tucked inside an excellent warm and soft bun.Summary: Drunk and sloppy.' u"FYI they increased their bottomless brunch price! It's now $19 for 90 minutes unlimited mimosas or sangrias NOT $12 for 2 hours. Also you can't switch between the two. If you choose mimosas you have to stick to that for the rest of your meal. (Luckily my friend had ordered the mimosa and I ordered the sangria so we just took sips of each other's.)For my brunch entr\xe9e I got the ostrich mini burgers. They were very flavorful and filling but honestly I only got that to be able to say that I've tried ostrich. I didn't think it tasted that distinct - kinda reminded me of a lamb burger.We ordered a side of potatoes for the table and they also give you free cornbread at the start of your meal. The food was pleasant but I just felt a bit cheated because they had just increased the bottomless brunch price. And this is not reflected on their online menus yet!3 stars because it's a good brunch place but there are cheaper places for bottomless brunch so I wouldn't come back here." u'Great experience here! I came for their awesome boozy brunch deal which is bottomless "exotic-fruit mimosas" for $12 on top of your meal. Can\'t beat that! The ostrich burgers were insanely delicious I highly recommend. There are only two sliders and a mini side salad so not terribly filling but totally worth it. The fruit mimosas (peachy flavor) were good in the beginning but got progressively more juice heavy. Not the end of the world though. Braai is South African food and the atmosphere reflected a South African theme. It was a cozy dimly lit space with African music playing in the background. A super unique experience in general really glad we tried it out!' u'My boyfriend and I are locals but ended up in this touristy area of the city and were surrounded by restaurants that are supposed to be great but had no reservations on a Friday night. So we decided to give Braai a try as we figured we would get a table and we were super curious to try South African tapas. From the beginning the hostess was honestly a complete mess. I\'m not sure if it was a language barrier issue or if she was just a little off her game. There was a table open but she led us to one bar stool to sit down (there are two of us) and told us we would move when a table was open. We kept pointing at said open table and she was confused saying what? No sit here you move when the next table leaves. Whatever no big deal. We sit down I order a drink. 5 minutes later she shows us to the table I was pointing at and says ohhh ok you sit there. We carry our stuff to that table. She hands us a cocktail menu I ask where the beer list is. She points to the cocktail menu and says yes beer there. I think I must be crazy because although it\'s hand written and complicated I see no beers. She returns we tell her there is no beer on that list. She says OHH beer\'s over there- and points to a row of beer bottles on the bar like 20 feet away. So my boyfriend squints trying to make out the brand names to order one. I\'m not even sure how patrons at the back of the restaurant would know the beer selection. I ordered a Lychee cocktail and quite honestly it was one of the worst drinks I\'ve had in NYC. I don\'t think there was a bartender on this night and that the waiters were making their own drinks.Onto the food we ordered the 5 tapas dishes for $42. We chose the ostrich sliders the lamb shank empanadas truffle mac and cheese grilled lamb chops and the peri peri wings. The good: lamb shank empanadas grilled lamb chops ostrich sliders. The "truffle" mac and cheese did not taste of truffle and had some dehydrated sausages on top that were gross to look at. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ostrich sliders I thought they were eh. I don\'t think they would be anything special if they weren\'t ostrich. One of my peri peri wings was so bloody inside I couldn\'t eat another one. Messing up wings is not easy guys. All in all it\'s a great deal for the money but the food and drinks totally miss the mark and there\'s not the redeeming service to save them. Our waitress was very nice though and we love the South African concept; just wish it was executed better.' u"Falsely advertised drink prices. Half of the things on their website menu aren't even available here. It's hotter than a sauna in here. Bathroom is disgusting. I've had much better food in NYC as the salmon didn't taste fresh and the salad looked like it was out for 3 days. All this and poor service- can't recommend this place at all. Looking at the other Yelp reviews I'm not surprised." u"Was disappointed to see that Xai Xai closed but heard Braai was the same owner and decided to give it a try. Pleased to see that Braai has some of the same menu items and the same vibe. No I'm not S African so I didn't test the clearly Italian waiter on S African phrases or sides (who does that?!) but if you're looking for something different in a great ambiance give it a try! It has S African d\xe9cor dim lighting and soft S African music playing in the background. \xa0It's sooooo hard to find places that serve good S African wine full stop and I would come back just for their wine list. LOVE the shirazes." u"I have been to this place so many times. I must say it's been quite a favorite casual dinner spot. The selection of wines are exquisite I suggest for the selection of Pinor Noir. Food yum! Delish!!! Try the platter of Tapas for $40 and you're in for a treat! Also if you are looking for a place to impress your date a little intimate with candles and not trying hard so much this I recommend.Sundays have brunch here and enjoy the unlimited mixed cocktails for like $20 or less...I held 2 birthday parties here and attended 3. That would say a lot for Braai. Try it!" u"Had brunch there today. Great drinks lackluster service and it wasn't that busy. Once the music came on it was entirely too loud. Servers seemed a little understaffed and VERY distracted. My friend bought the unlimited mimosas and in 90 minutes she only got 2 refills. Not good enough for $20.Food was good but not hot. All in all won't be returning." u"I would like to think that I'm a regular at this place. \xa0At least a dinner every week and brunch most weekends. \xa0 \xa0No need for the menu since the staff already know what I want for dinner and for brunch. \xa0So anyways the d\xe9cor has much to be desired especially during brunch when you can actually see everything.....at night it's very cozy with pretty much dim lighted ambience. \xa0The food is amazing!!!!!!!...... serving size is just perfect.... the staff are pretty friendly overall. \xa0You need to try their braised lamb !!!! \xa0Highly recommended. \xa0Same owner as Aria an Italian restaurant/bar in the same street." u"I came here for my birthday brunch and I was excited to try their South African take on traditional brunch items.The experience was decent in terms of food and service. My party arrived at 11 so it was definitely still early. We were the only ones in the restaurant for a bit and it seemed like they were still cleaning up from the previous night. Also I think we were being waited on by someone on the prep staff at first so he was a bit unaware when it came to the menu. When it came time for ordering I got the S'African Brekkie which is apparently their take on the traditional English breakfast. It comes with eggs your way boerewors sausage breakfast hash grilled tomato onions and toast. The meal was filling yet wasn't particularly outstanding. My scrambled eggs were a bit watery and the sausage (perhaps it's just this type of sausage) was really dry. Also the presentation left much to be desired as the food was somewhat shoveled on only one side of the plate. I was left filled but my taste buds weren't given the adventure they were hoping for. Similarly my friend was disappointed with her eggs benedict when the eggs were fried instead of poached.With regards to service the waiters were very attentive with the refilling our (note: very affordable) brunch drinks and for the surprise birthday cake my friends brought they even put on a special song for me on the stereo. Ambience as well was pretty good. There are a mix of high and low tables and the restaurant has a distinct rustic feel.Overall a decent brunch place in terms of price but the food could be tightened up a bit to improve." u'I\'ve been to Braai for brunch five times now and it\'s become one of my favorite brunch spots. I haven\'t yet been for dinner (mainly because I love the brunch so much! But I\'ll have to give their dinner menu a try sometime)The noise level and crowd factor has varied - some of the days I\'ve gone it\'s been quiet with not so many people while other times it\'s been packed (and obviously louder as a result). It\'s a really chill comfortable atmosphere either way though. I\'ve always made a reservation beforehand so I definitely recommend doing the same!Their bottomless brunch special is a great deal only $12 per person for "exotic fruit mimosas" (I\'m not entirely sure what fruit(s) they are but they\'re delicious and I prefer them to regular mimosas) added on to your total with a 2-hour limit and the staff is constantly coming by to refill your glasses even when they aren\'t empty (sometimes when they\'re not even close to empty!) The only downside is that if you want just one drink (which is what I did at one point) it costs the same price which is disappointing but if that\'s the case and you\'re with other people who are doing the unlimited mimosas I\'d just have one of theirs at some point during the time you\'re there.The food is AMAZING - everything I\'ve had there is delicious. I\'ve had the Huguenot French toast twice and it\'s delicious (although last time I had it I felt like it was a bit heavy on the syrup so next time I get it I\'m planning to ask for syrup on the side). I had the Biltong mac and cheese once which was great as well (it does have beef shavings on top - advising this for those of you who are vegetarian - so if you\'d like the mac and cheese I\'d ask if it were possible to have it without the beef). The lump crab eggs benedict and egg in the hole (and the chakalaka on the side!) were also both really yummy. One of my friends got the flapjacks and shared some with me and those were beyond amazing - probably my favorite thing that I\'ve had there so far and I\'m definitely planning to order those next time I go. I\'ve also tried some of my friends\' fried chicken and miele pap which was also really good but just a heads up - the chicken piece they give is huge! I have yet to try the ostrich but I\'ll probably try it on the eggs benedict at some point.The one thing that I\'d advise is that if you\'re paying either fully or partially in cash be sure to ask for change because one time when my friends and I went there we were planning to use the change that came back as our tip but we got nothing back meaning they just assumed that the rest was the tip. So when you pay always be sure to say you\'d like change back (unless of course you do happen to be including the tip in the full amount that you give).Overall Braai is a great food place with a nice atmosphere and a great place to go for groups as well (I\'ve been there with as many as 7 people and seen people with even larger parties) so I highly recommend it! I also love the mini muffins they put out before they serve your main meals which come with butter and orange marmalade. :)' u"Stopped here with my wife excited to eat some South African food. She is South African I have visited there multiple times with her and she was super excited to have a taste of home. Some of the items on the menu sounded authentic while others really didn't have much to do with South Africa at all. As soon as we tried to order the excitement ended. Multiple items on the menu were not available and it was not particularly late so I doubt they ran out that day especially since it wasn't busy at all. This would bother me at any restaurant but it was even more bothersome here because everything my wife ordered which were the more authentic items on the menu were the items they did not have. They were out of at least three items on the menu. She ended up having to piece together a meal of various items from different listings. She ordered pap chakalaka biltong and lamb chops and I ordered the lamb bunny chow. The pap (a type of cornmeal porrige) which is typically made from white cornmeal was made from yellow cornmeal here. It was also very soft and somewhat runny almost when typically in South Africa it is quite firm. The chakalaka was closer to authentic than the pap but seemed heavy on the onions. The biltong by itself basically South African jerky was pretty good and tasted authentic. Now the lamb chops were good and while lamb or mutton is commonly eaten in South Africa I can't speak for the authenticity of the preparation method. The lamb bunny chow which is lamb curry served in a hollowed out quarter loaf of white bread was pretty good and while maybe not typically served in grilled/toasted bread in South Africa and certainly not enough curry flavor I still enjoyed it. For dessert we ordered the koeksisters and although I have never eaten it before my wife stated that it did not at all taste like what she expected. She said it should be more like a donut. It reminded me of the mildly sweet dessert breads of Finland and I liked it quite a lot. It was served on top of ice cream.The wine list at Braai does consist of all South African wines and we enjoyed a bottle of mourvedre with our dinner. Afterwards we enjoyed some Amarula which is a South African cream liqueur. They also have selection of beers but none from South Africa. I drank a Tusker beer which I believe is from Kenya.The service definitely left a lot to be desired. Our server was nice when we spoke to him and while he was at our table we enjoyed talking to him. However he payed us little attention after he left and never checked up on us. I had to stand up three times and walk over to him to order dessert or more drinks. The atmosphere is nice with a dim lighting and candles on all the tables. There was South African music playing and the volume was perfect so that the music could be enjoyed without interfering with conversation.If I was to rate this restaurant strictly on the food not on what it was supposed to be but how it tasted I would give them a higher rating. But since they advertise themselves as a South African restaurant the lack of authenticity is a problem. Also the fact that multiple items were missing from their menu means its time for a menu change. And the subpar service is also an issue. I wanted to like the restaurant and honestly enjoyed the food and drinks but there were just too many other strikes against them." u"So we decided to walk around the neighborhood while waiting to be seated for Ippudo. Then we saw this little restaurant with a very flavorful menu outside and we decided to give it a try!I ordered steak and eggs for $16 and it was a great price for brunch. The portion was not small at all and the meat was good. My boyfriend ordered some kind of ostrich burger? He said it was not bad even though he wished he could taste the ostrich a bit more. We really enjoyed the food especially the octopus! I had never had any grilled octopus that was so soft before. And the sauce was just simply amazing. The reason why I may not go back is that the place was so noisy and I almost couldn't tolerate it at first but then some people left so it turned out okay for me to stay. Nice decorations though." u'Really great hole in the wall for something different. \xa0My bf and I did the tapas special (5 for $42) each had a glass of pinotage and added a goat cheese and mango salad a side of coconut truffle pap and a side of chakalaka. \xa0At the end of the meal we ranked the dishes:1) octopus-so tender and the tangy BBQ sauce complimented really well2) tie for chakalaka (which is kind of like stewed vegetables very mild spiciness I thought it had the perfect level of heat) and the ostrich sliders (mildly spicy sauce and peppered onions)4) goat cheese and mango salad the mango was sliced paper thin and was really delightful5) peri peri wings- good crunch on the wings and the peri peri is a fun flavor6) pap- a bit too salty and no coconut flavor 7) lamb chops -dry but the sauce was the same as on the octopus and quite tasty8) biltong bruschetta -tasted like beef jerky on a baguette slathered with spaghettio sauce (sweet tomato sauce)We will def go back and try the entrees and desserts!' u"Stopped here with friends on a whim before going to see the NY Philharmonic! I love the ambiance of this restaurant; the candles and the dim lighting were really beautiful as was the distressed wood floors. \xa0This would be an awesome place for a date.That being said service was quite slow and did not feel very attentive despite coming in at an off-hour and only seeing one or two other tables seated with customers.I enjoyed trying South African food though! I'm not sure how authentic it was but I enjoyed the chicken bobotie (it was pretty much chicken meatloaf) and the oxtail (perfectly cooked). \xa0I'd advise skipping the prawns peri-peri because it was a bit overcooked." u'Braai is a south african restaurant where we tried the brunch and loved it! Was I extremely satisfied with the food?- well not indeed. But the overall experience and especially exotic fruit champagne for sure made it up for us. It was quite pricy as any other brunch place in NY so be ready 4 it. Try to give yourself sometime to enjoy limitless champagne!']
25.Casa Agave NYC,[u"OH THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS!I went here with my coworker and we ordered tacos from their lunch menu. It was surprisingly cheap and delicious. They give you chips and salsa to start and we each ordered three (3) tacos (on the smaller side) which came with a side of rice bowl and salad. We weren't able to finish everything and had to take the rest to go -- the portion isn't too heavy but enough to give you a decent sized food baby :o)Friendly staff and the overall ambiance is chill/casual. It was a nice day out so we sat by the open windows. A good spot to people watch since there's a lot of foot traffic.I regret not trying anything from their happy hour drink menu but I will be back! Great restaurant and conveniently located a few blocks from my office." u"Loved the guac -- it was chunky and the raw onions didn't overpower. It would have been even better if it was colder than room temp but hey not gonna complain about fresh guac. Really good chicken quesadilla with a pickled onion salad on the side. The meat was very tender and pulled apart easily there were 3 types of cheeses and it was just the right amount to balance out the chicken. Unfortunately I found a bone in mine though so I wasn't a fan of that... The salsa that came with the guac was a better pairing with the quesadilla than the salsa that actually came with the quesadilla.The tacos al pastor were a little messy but just enough with the level of spicy and chunks of pineapple--really nice combo.Definitely coming back! Would like to try the fajitas next time the people next to us got it and it smelled amazing..." u'Casa Agave why do you have 4 stars on yelp? \xa0It must be the brunch special? \xa0Perhaps people are writing their reviews after drinking a lot of Sangria? \xa0Anyhoo I stopped by Casa Agave for dinner on a Saturday after a show. \xa0The service was friendly and attentive with several servers checking in on our table multiple times. \xa0I ordered a white sangria (which was just okay) from the happy hour menu for $5/glass. \xa0Next we ordered the $12 guacamole. \xa0A server came out with a cart and made the guac table side. \xa0The guac was the highlight of the meal obviously very fresh however it was served with a basket of incredibly stale tortilla chips. \xa0It was around that time we noticed the place was swarming with flies. \xa0Gross. \xa0For dinner we split the tacos mariscos. Not great. \xa0The tacos were bland and the seafood was a little overcooked. \xa0Moral of the story I will not be going back.' u"Casa Agave was a disappointment.I came here in extremely hungry. Doesn't food taste better when you are hungry? They seemed to have good lunch specials for $9.95 which attracted me to this place. Also the tableside made guac was another factor in me coming here.Well let's start off with the guac. The waiter did a great job of making the guac. Sure it was expensive it was $12 but it was very good.Now let's move on to the lunch specials. You can choose either tacos or enchiladas. I went with the chicken mole enchilada. The lunch specials also include either a salad or a beverage. The waiter had no idea that this was included I asked if I could have the salad and he asked me if I wanted a side salad that cost money. I said that it was included. He said no and brought the menu over to prove it to me. Well I pointed out what the menu said he read it carefully and agreed to give us the free salad. When you think salad you think of a nice fresh bed of lettuce leaves and some other vegetables like tomatoes. Well I got limp ice berg lettuce that looked like leftover lettuce that did not make it to yesterday's tacos. And a radish that was so soggy that I spit it out. The dressing was horrible it tasted like salt water. I felt like I was eating old ice berg lettuce soaked in salt water.The chicken mole was actually good. The chicken was absolutely tender and that mole sauce... I don't know what's in it but it was good. The side of rice and beans was bad. Usually the rice and beans come in separate bowls the combined it in one bowl no big deal. The rice was dry and hard as a rock... is water too expensive? Did they forget to add water to the rice? It was horrible. The beans tasted like Rosarita beans straight out of a can. It really wasn't good.Come on get the basic right. Its a Mexican restaurant at the very least please cook your rice properly. And don't serve me leftover lettuce from yesterday.To top it off the female bathroom lock was broken. Somebody came in while I was in there." u'Love this place. \xa0Great food and $5 happy hour. \xa0Boom!' u'The food here is amazing! I ordered steak tacos and the steak was heavenly cooked and spiced! It\'s no surprised the place gets packed quickly but they do accept reservations! Tip: they do have a really good happy hour with delicious margaritas from 4-8pm but only at the bar if you sit at the table they only give you one round of "happy hour deals" then you have to pay full price.' u"Stumbled upon this gem and what an unplanned amazing first date! We missed a movie and it was late on a Friday night.. We were promptly seated in the back. Dark atmosphere with royal blue fluorescent lighting makes for a romantic but fun backdrop. Food was excellent! Guacamole chips and moderately spicy salsa were perfect.. My date had some fish dish with rice and beans.. My only criticism was the fish was a bit salty but still very good and reasonably priced. Ok let me get to the best part.. The margaritas! I had 3 (don't judge me).. I had a frozen mango which was very good but the coconut was the star of the show! Had 2 of those and was feeling great. Bathroom was close enough for me to casually stumble to and was clean when I got there. Service was prompt and very friendly. I love this place and am looking forward to going back." u'had to deduct 1 star b/c of no AC - it was a humid night.My friend and I came here after changing our mind from another spot in the area. \xa0It was a great choice. \xa0The shrimp guac & chips appetizer was so savory- we ate it all. \xa0We had the seafood tacos and the fried fish tacos both were super yummy. \xa0I appreciate the spices and veggies in the tacos tasted like someone cares =) \xa0My mojito was a pleasant compliment to the well prepared foods.the guac made to order is a special treat as the server uses his mixing spoons as instruments.this is a great date place. \xa0small intimate dimly lit yet a lil warm in the summer but hey the heat plus spices plus drinks may make your eve that much more fun. *wink*' u"Came in here with some friends the other evening. They had a decent happy hour with $5 margaritas $4 beers and sangria. We ordered table-sid guacamole to start which was fresh and just the right amount of spicy. For entrees I had steak enchiladas and my friends had fish tacos and chicken tacos. I wasn't a huge fan of mine but they really enjoyed their tacos.The wait staff is super friendly and attentive. They came by to check on us and refilled our waters frequently. The place itself is super small so on a lively night there is a wait! We were practically on top of the table behind us and I think i heard more of their conversation than my own. Overall though i didn't love my meal I'd love to come back and try something else. This place had good prices and it's great reviews make me want to give it another shot!" u"Hit up this spot after a day at the theatre. The service was awesome and the prices were great compared to what we saw a few avenues over (definitely worth the walk). We had ordered guacamole that was made right in front of us (fresher than fresh! video will be attached) and then four different entrees. I went with the chorizo quesadilla which was yummy my brother the steak my mother a seafood stew and my dad (I don't remember!). The food was about average but the service and pricing is what really pushed up my rating to four stars! I'd totally go again just beware the restaurant is def on the tiny side so you will be close to other patrons. Every table was occupied by the time we left! My only negative was the bathroom door not locking please fix!" u'Very impressed with this place! The guac made on the spot was delicious the fish tacos were amazing and the strawberry margarita was tasty! My friend got the steak taco which was good as well. The service was definitely something to be noted. We made reservations and were seated RIGHT on time. Our orders were taken promptly and the waiter was consistent in making sure that had water and were happy. He even split the margarita between two cups for us- without us even asking. Just little things I experienced throughout the night made me really appreciate the service here.Overall this place exceeded my expectations and I will be back soon!' u"Back for more of the best! Hungry for good Mexican food after a long day at the museums.Better than being in Mexico!My wife was born in Mexico and was amazed at the quality of food here .Don't miss their Brunch or Happy Hour." u"Cute spot for date night/one-on-one girlfriends' night but likely not as ideal for larger groups over 4 people. I made a reservation for 5 at 6:30 pm for my patent crew dinner on a Friday. When I arrived I realized that they were a smaller venue than I anticipated and felt bad that my friends were running late (#lawyerlife)... I felt that we were squatting on some prime real estate. DRINKS:-happy hour 5(?)-8pm. $4 and up specials. -margaritas are awesome. -sangrias are freshly made so the fruit didn't have time to infuse into the drink. SKIP. \xa0Sangrias need to be made a while before serving. FOOD:-guacamole is made at the table when they aren't as swamped. Ignore the spice levels. If you can tolerate sriracha/cholula get the spicy or you won't even taste the peppers. Definitely get this. -chicken mole is great. Looks like about half of a chicken served with a small rice & beans. -fajitas are good. Maybe 6-8oz (cooked weight) chicken? Lighter on the meat portion than I am used to in Texas but definitely good-sized for the neighborhood/NYC context. Served with rice/beans/tortilla. -enchiladas and tacos looked good but I didn't get to try. Almost everything can be ordered with flour or corn tortillas. SERVICE: pretty good overall. They kept our water filled and greeted us with smiles. They did want to charge extra for hot salsa ($2) and don't have just tobasco/cholula/something to bring to the table though. I understand that they are proud of their house-made stuff but I honestly can't taste the fire in pretty much any of their house stuff. Overall they were awesome and the food/music/atmosphere was great. I would definitely come back... But I'll be bringing my own hot sauce with me." u'Food and service were subpar. I was asked if I wanted hot sauce with my tacos I said yes (of course) and was charged $2. Food took forever to come out and was not worth the wait' u'Super disappointed in this place. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was tiny! They only used one tortilla and folded it in half. The chicken was still watery from being boiled and it wasn\'t marinated - just plain ole boiled chicken! I was underwhelmed not to mention famished even after consuming my pathetic "meal."' u'For my last 12 years in NY I have kept a list of the best Mexican restaurants in the city as a way get back to the amazing Mexican food I enjoyed growing up out West. This place is easily in my top 3. Get the seafood guacamole and any of the tacos and you will be in heaven. I will travel out of my way to stop at this place. Staff is super nice and friendly.' u"Came here recently with three friends and had a great time.I got there first and was waiting at the bar. \xa0I asked if they had any special cocktails and she said I could have a margarita. \xa0I thought that was pretty strange that a Mexican restaurant would offer margaritas as a special cocktail but figured they must not have house cocktails. \xa0I had wanted a tequila or mezcal drink maybe something spicy but alas I ordered a margarita. \xa0 It was super tart but good nonetheless. \xa0When my friends arrived and we sat at our table I was a little surprised to find a cocktail menu with lots of special drinks. \xa0Oh well.... \xa0I made up for that with my next round.Aside from that everything was great. \xa0 Made to order table side guac was so good we had two. \xa0 Between us we had fish tacos pork enchiladas mole and...something else. \xa0 Everyone cleaned his plate. \xa0Yum. \xa0And the service was good too. \xa0 Our waters were always full and we never had to call them over.I'll definitely be back." u"Great food and even better drinks! I was in a rush and had to come back for my meal. \xa0They were very understanding and didn't complain about my quick exit.The shrimp quesedilla was SO good and the happy hour margaritas hit the spot!I also love the fact that your guacamole is made at your table to your spice level. I will definitely be back!" u'Best margaritas you can find! It is a great place for Mexican food and specially for great MARGARITAS! The staff is very friendly and provide an excellent service. Want a quick awesome Mexican meal? Come here.' u"Trouble is brewing in this sector of Hell's Kitchen. \xa0Three taco joints within a square block means trouble for someone. \xa0Casa Agave has the right ingredients to be one of the survivors. \xa0As a lunch spot three excellent tacos rice beans chips salsa and a mason jar size drink for $10 is hard to beat.About the FOOD I inhaled the tacos al pastor which are fresh well prepared and served on small thin tortillas. \xa0The tortillas have all the markings of made on premise. \xa0The salsa de arbor is just right. \xa0I managed to cause a small container to disappear while waiting for the tacos. \xa0Fresh limeade among other choices.DRINKS look promising with a healthy list of cocktails and all the appearances of a fine happy hour. \xa0More on that in the future.Of the three this one is the class act and for now it's affordable. \xa0We'll see how popularity changes prices."]
57.Jasper’s Taphouse + Kitchen,[u"Wooo this place is awesome! I came with a group of friends and spent a good portion of the night there. The waitress was nice and always on top of refilling our drinks and taking our orders. We ordered the usual drinks while there but I have to highlight one dish that I thought was absolutely DELICIOUS!+A Poutine dish. Can't remember the name but there's only one on the menu. It was cheese gravy pork and fries in a hot skillet." u"Went in for Burger Special. They gave me a small local beer (that was $6) with an undercooked attempt at a brisket burger ($14 total...you can get a $10 special if you look around). The bartender while attractive nothing there. I tried numerous times to spark casual conversation. Nope. On top it's 91 degrees outside...turn on the f-info A/C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I used to go all the time but now it seems as if the owners have let it go. Good luck enjoying it. I won't go back." u"Absolutely loved my first visit to Jasper's with my wife. On a busy night with a great Copa America game on half the TV's and a great NBA finals game on the rest the staff was none the less attentive and wonderful. Tina was hands down the sweetest kindest most attentive and genuine bartender I've ever had in New York. Kind and honest quick with a suggestion or an anecdote she's the prototypical bartender you expect to see in a Hollywood film and just phenomenal at her job to boot. The beer selection was great and the Irish whisky selection even better. The fried pickles were delicious a perfect crunchy treat for late night eating. A Friday at 10pm during playoffs season sounds like a nightmare in the making for a bar just a couple avenues from Times Square but Tina and the staff at Jasper's made it a delight." u"Thanks to Yelp we decided to try this place out late on a Friday night in search of a good bar. The place is small very casual and was really packed when we got there around 10:30pm; however that didn't stop us from scoring a small table to sit at. The service was good in that it wasn't great and it wasn't bad either. At first our waitress was attentive but as the night got busier she was nowhere to be found. They have many tv's in the restaurant for game watching. We were so happy to catch the second half of the playoffs! My husband ordered one of their bottled beers and I ordered a glass of wine. I wasn't thrilled with their limited wine selection choices but I guess I'm not supposed to complain since it's more of a beer drinking type place. But if you're going to serve wine why not pick options that are desirable? A Chardonnay from Chile and a Sauvignon Blanc from California as the only type of each varietal makes no sense to any wine drinker whatsoever. I ordered the Santa Fe Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a side of Fries and it was amazing! The chicken had so much flavor and the avocado really complimented the sandwich with the pico de gallo. The fries were crispy and delicious! If there's anything that could use improvement about the me sandwich I would say a better quality bread as this bread wasn't the best. My hubby got the Turkey Burger with Curly Fries and his burger was awesome! The burger was one of the best turkey burgers we've had in a while. The Fries were yummy icing on the cake we wish we had. Overall we had a fun time and the food was quite pleasing!" u"Looked for a late night bar for a burger and beer late. It's opened till 4:00 AM. Burger nice and thick cooked perfectly medium rare. Coney Island Mermaid Tap beer and fries on the side. Pure heaven. Recommended." u"Came here on a Saturday around noon - it was pretty empty but that's a shame it has a great brunch special! \xa0Free mimosa/bloody mary with entrees (we got the bloody mary and it was pretty good for being free).We had the habanero lime chicken wings (good flavor nice crispiness) and the pulled pork skillet (really good sweet potatoes and peppers and egg the pork was a little dry).Nice place! \xa0Great beer selection." u'Actually went here on a recommendation of another bar that had stopped serving food. Great choice. The atmosphere was wonderful. Alive but not overpowering our experience. The food was great! Beers unique and delicious. Simply the kind of place that must find a spot in your regular restaurant rotation.' u"Definitely avoid their brunch. We went in for brunch on a very hot day - the AC wasn't working. The brunch food was very bland. The bacon seemed like it had been reheated in the microwave from the day before. They do include one cocktail with a brunch entr\xe9e." u"While I'm surprised that I never gave it a second glance on the many trips past this corner Jasper's Taphouse + Kitchen was an interesting brunch spot in the heart of Hells Kitchen. Key requirements besides good grub were a welcoming atmosphere (especially in the heart of the gayborhood) and multiple TVs showing various Sunday football games and baseball playoffs. Jasper's delivered on all!While waiting for others to arrive we ran through a few Bloody Mary specials. Plus one for the accoutrements like pickled beans. Yum! Our server was super nice and always made sure our glasses were refilled (if we wanted).The food was traditional brunch fare for a gastropub but also included a few more interesting items like Abbey Braised Pork Poutine. We shared a huge platter of Crispy Chicken Wings half Bourbon BBQ and half Habanero. Both equally tasty but I loved the heat of the Habanero wings. The French fries were good too.My 1/2 pound burger with Dubliner cheese and added avocado was hugely delicious! Another side order of French fries was too much. I was stuffed and didn't even finish. Jasper's is a fun place to relax pig out drink \xa0and watch sports with the boys. We'll definitely come back to try other menu items like the Brussels & Bacon Fried Pickle Chips and obviously their huge selection of craft beers." u'Great beer choices and good draft prices on a friday afternoon. \xa0Had eggplant bites yummy. \xa0 Steak sandwhich very good and filling' u'Delicious food! We ordered the buffalo chicken sliders and the curly fries. This place does not disappoint.' u"Yes it is as good as it gets. I had the juiciest burger of my life there and one of the tastest. In fact it was a close second. The bartender on at the time (a tuesday evening) was friendly helpful and gave personal attention although it was a pretty full bar.This is definitely a place I'd stop when i'm in the neighborhood. A great place to hang with friends or grab some world class comfort food." u'A bit biased because my girlfriend and I came here all the time when we first started dating. The food is on point for a bar and always a good spot to watch a game. My only gripe is that the servers (save for the manager he has always been attentive) can be a bit forgetful or down right bad.' u"Cool place. Follows new trend in midtown craft beer bar with local menu but it's very well done. \xa0Dark lighting with a wood bar top with no rail and a wood box foot rest. \xa0Stools with no back support. \xa0Taps in middle of bar consuming some bar space but it works. \xa0Bar back (north wall) contains shelves and beer menu. \xa0Like a really large amount of bottle and glass shelves. 3 HDTVs at ends of bar and opposite the bar. \xa0Corner entrance. \xa0Open space opposite the bar contain high top tables. \xa0As you can guess there's a huge beer menu. \xa0The food is solid for your typical bar food." u'Great find for lunch after spending the morning in Central Park. Decor is great VERY clean and even fresh flowers. You can basically eat from the bathroom floor and THAT says a lot about a restaurant.I was surprised how empty it was but decided to give it a try. We ordered the turkey burger with egg add-on and chicken salad. My burger and fresh home made cut fries were amazing!Not a great selection of beers if you like lighter beer and watching your Girlish figure however for true brew lovers- you have tons of IPAs/Pilsners on tap.Service was friendly and attentive. You must try this place!' u'This place was a huge surprise. I know what you\'re thinking big corner in Hell\'s Kitchen clearly very designed lots of money sunk into it = overpriced drinks and bad fried food. You my friend are just as wrong as I was! I\'ve walked by this place for AGES and finally went in at the behest of my boyfriend who is on a never-ending (and sadly quite unfruitful) quest for a bar with good well-priced beer and good food. He doesn\'t believe me when I tell him space limitations in Manhattan preclude this. \xa0Enter Jasper. This place had a legit craft beer board (comparable to Pony Bar) and amazing food! You have to try their eggplant chips with sea salt and honey it was a huge plate and way more (both on amazing flavor and portion size) than I expected for the price even at a "gastropub." Their burgers were so thick and juicy my boyf actually took some of it home. When we visited on Thanksgiving Sunday they nicely had the sound on but not blaring for the games which we appreciated.' u"Went for drinks before dinner. \xa0They were ok. \xa0Staff was friendly-ish. \xa0Nothing special though and probably wouldn't rush back. \xa0Food menu was not very appealing for us so we went onwards for meal." u"Needed a beverage while strolling around Hell's Kitchen. \xa0Found Jaspers.Great location super beer list. \xa0Friendly staff." u'The food and drinks were great. Everything was great until the bill came. A few friends if mine went to Jaspers to take advantage of the 5 dollar happy hour drinks. While surveying the drinks on tap the waitress came to me and pointed out the drinks on the top half of the menus being included in the happy hour. When the bill came she switched up and told us only select beers from the portion of the menu were happy hour. When I asked how anyone would know what the select beers were she responded with you have to ask. Absolutely absurd. She gave me false information and then tried to make it my fault. My friends and I were livid the last time we will ever go to that greedy establishment' u"Some of the better sports bar food I've had in a long time. They have a small menu but enough options and some game time specials. Shared the Tailgate Platter $30 with my friend. This platter included two kinds of different sliders fries and hot wings. All of the food was tasty fresh and plenty for two grown men. Some great $5 drinks specials and local beers. I had a local blonde. Service was very friendly and attentive. We were here for NFL Sunday and they had most of the games on and were not supper busy like a few other bars in the area."]
152.Kuro-Obi,[u"Inside City Kitchen on the 2nd floor! They're suspiciously quick with getting the orders out. Quite efficient. I got extra egg in mine of course. That was the best part. Second best part was the pork. So fatty and tender. The broth was good too but made me really thirsty after. The noodles were just ok had the texture of spaghetti not chewy or bouncy. I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here but if I'm in Times Square (uh there's really NOTHING to eat in TSq!!) I'll definitely come back!" u'An ippudo spin-off this place sells ramen and pork buns for pretty high prices. Though the notability of its name and the location inside a trendy food court in midtown says that.Only had an order of pork buns. Overall the meat was pretty tender the bun was moist and the sauce on top had a noticeable kick of sweetness miso and spiciness. It was fine.3.4' u"Since my wife and I came back from Japan we have wanted to find a great ramen place and good news we just did. \xa0We ordered the kuro obi ramen (black belt) and it had an amazing flavor that reminded us of Japan.This place is associated with Ippudo since the ramen bowls used does say Ippudo. \xa0We have yet to venture there and here lines are long. \xa0At this place there was no line however it's take out style. \xa0You'll be given a paper bowl with a lid and then you'll bring that to an open table. \xa0This ramen has been the best we had since Japan. \xa0We will definitely be returning and trying out all the other ravens on the menu. \xa0A must try if you're around the area." u'Ippudo Ramen perfected a new recipe which involves "a process that takes over two days they felt confident enough to open a new NYC ramen specializing in it. Kuro-Obi Ramen located inside the City Kitchen. \xa0It also marks the first time any Ippudo branch is offering ramen to go with the recipe supposedly adjusted to make it "more friendly to the perils of "take away ramen". This makes it perfect for me since I don\'t like being solo and rather have take out. And this is only a few blocks from the PABT and my bus home.I tried their Shiro-Obi Classic the simplest of the three offerings on their menu served only with scallions and char siu pork belly as toppings. The soup was thick and flavorful and exceeded my expectations as I often find bone broths a bit watered down in take out joints. That was not the case here; full of tasty fat and flavorful. The noodles which are made in-house by Ippudo were light and springy and held up perfectly to the thick soup after I got home 45 minutes later.They also have the Kuro Modern and the K.O. Karaka Men which I need to try.Price is about $13 and these are not big bowls or should I say takeout cups but you can add extras like \xa0Umami Tamago (Soft Boiled Egg) Karashi Takana (Leaf Mustard) and my choice Chashu Pork. They also carry Pork Buns Japanese beer and sodas.Just in case you don\'t have to venture to 8th Avenune for Kuro-Obi Ramen they have open up at the Urbanspace Vanderbilt too.' u"I almost missed this little find if it wasn't for my cousin getting it as it was tucked away in the corner! My cousin and I decided to try different ones so we could have the best of both worlds: Kuro-Obi and Aka-Obi. Of the two I really liked the Kuro-Obi because of the garlic flavor. As a big fan of garlic having it as part of the broth base was delicious and satisfying. Something different from what I'm usually used to. For the Aka-Obi I was hoping that it was going to be spicy reminiscent of Ippudo's Karaka-men but it wasn't as spicy or had that kick I was anticipating. Would rather just go to Ippudo to satisfy that spicy ramen fix.Overall I like the concept of having ramen of this stature be accessible in this capacity especially if you're not trying to wait that long wait at Ippudo. Definitely not the same but an awesome alternative in getting your meal in less than 10 minutes. Wham bam and in your stomach!" u'I had no idea this was affiliated with the Ippudo family of restaurants until I saw the chopsticks said "Ippudo NY" and did some digging. For ramen in a food court this was actually really good and beats the time spent formally sitting at Ippudo. I actually enjoyed it more than what I remember from Ippudo.I got the Kuro-Obi or "Black Belt" ramen ($12) which has a garlic oil in there which you can definitely taste. This broth was heavy and definitely fatty/greasy for anyone who is opposed to that type of broth. This one definitely had a layer of oil you could visibly see the separation going on. But that\'s flavor man... just don\'t eat it every day for lunch. No one likes a greasy garlic-y co-worker.My only gripe is that you have to pay $2 to add an egg to any bowl which brings the price-point almost back up to restaurant pricing which kind of ruins the whole "I\'m getting ramen in a to-go container and saving money" vibe. I think the portion is also slightly smaller here so at that point you might as well just go sit-down at a ramen shop and get the full experience. I think for $10-12 with the smaller portion it should include an egg. So you know what I did... I deprived myself of the egg to prove a point. #IncludeTheEgg2016Overall this was a good bowl of ramen and a convenient way to sample some of the Ippudo creations. It also lets all your non-ramen loving friends eat something else while you get your fix.' u"I had no idea what to expect. I was following my map looking for a ramen joint and I found this gem in City Kitchen. It's located on the second floor and it's like a cozy upbeat cafeteria with great selections. It is pricey for ramen since its served I a small Togo container for added convenience in this setting. Definitely give it a go for a decent quick meal." u'Okay ramen pork very fatty. \xa0Broth and noodles okay. \xa0People nice fast service. Seating in the City Kitchen area needs more attention to cleaning tables' u"Came here to grab a quick meal since we only had 45 minutes before our Lion King Broadway show. Never knew there was this little cute food court by Times Square! Very oily broth you can especially see it when my camera flash is on. I still didn't mind it since it did warm me up on a wintery day in NYC. Ramen was not too soft and chewy just the way I liked it. Just a little pricey for 4 regular bites of ramen and broth I could not sip on.The pork belly buns were good but I think they could have used a bit less salt." u"Okay so apparently I'm not the brightest.I wondered why the ramen I had here was so good last night. I wondered why the chopsticks said ippudo and perhaps the bowl now that I think about it. But apparently I was too hungry to put 2 and 2 together and realize that kuro obi is an ippudo spin off.Reading up on this place now kuro obi is ippudo's spin off specializing in chicken broth based ramen. You would think it would give a less creamier broth than beef but no no no. The broth was just creamy and meaty enough to not be overwhelming (or condense after cooling). I loved my kuro modern. It hit every spot that's right when I was coming from the freezing cold. The prices are 10-12 per bowl which is pretty average but the portion is a bit smaller than restaurant size. However for the vibe of the city kitchen space (think intimate food court in the middle of Times Square ) and the no waiting factor it's a good quickie spot for ramen." u"Location- it is clean but located in a food court type of place. Despite being in a high traffic area I was able to find seating for my party of 5. Location of bathrooms are inconvenient. They are in the basement where you have to wait forever for the elevator to come up/down. And can't take the stairs since the stairs to the basement is key card access only. Believe that is so the public can't just come in from the street. Food- ordered the classic. Was great. Broth was delicious and had depth. With there were more pork pieces. But like other reviewers have said. Size portion is small for the price. But on the flip side I hardly had to wait for my meal. Would I come again? Probably. It is pretty convenient had access to try other things if coming with a big group of people and I didn't have to wait long." u'One of the best ramen bars in the city - not at all surprised when I discovered that this place was actually attached to Ippudo the most reviewed place in New York City.We ordered the pork bun and kuro modern ramen for share - they were in perfect small size allowing us to try more varieties. Unlike other places where ramen was hard to bite noodles at kuro-obi was soft yet chewy. The soup was creamy and rich loved it!! Pork bun was a bit mediocre though.' u"I hear Kuro-Obi is Ippudo's Spin-off. It's located inside City Kitchen and it's very packed inside if you go during lunch/dinner hours. We ordered the Black Belt the Red Belt and the pork belly bun. All of these items are comparable to Ippudo's status. They use chicken based broth for their ramen and it's very flavorful. The Black Belt has more of a mushroom taste it to and the Red Belt was the spicer version. The pork belly bun was delicious but I wished the meat was a little bit thicker. I've also noticed that their buns are larger than the typical ones you see at Chinese restaurants. *One difference I noted between Ippudo and Kuro-Obi is that I believe Kuro-Obi uses some kind of MSG or chicken broth cubes. I left feeling very thirsty. Overall a great meal!" u"I came here tonight with a few friends to catch up over dinner and to chill. What's great about City Kitchen is that they offer an abundance of different food choices including sushi lobster rolls doughnuts and shaved ice. I came here with a friend yesterday and I found myself back here tonight to try out the ramen here. I settled for number 3 on the menu which was the ramen noodles with spicy broth and pork belly. Upon receiving my meal I was surprised at how small the portion size was. I was hoping that the quality of the ramen and soup would make up for it and surely it did. The noodles were thin and chewy and overall great. The broth was nice and spicy and I found myself drinking the entire tub at the end lol. The pork belly was okay. I wish they would've gave a larger portion for $14 a pop though. Overall the food here was great but the portion size was extremely small. Would I come back again? I'll take my chances." u'Kuro Obi is a ramen stand at City Kitchen in the theater district. The menu is very simple three types of ramen: \xa0classic ($12) modern ($14) and spicy ($16). There are three toppings available: \xa0Unami egg ($2) karashi takana=leaf mustard ($3) and chashu pork ($4). There are also two appetizers: \xa0edamame ($6) and pork buns ($9). I tried the classic with Unami egg and received my ramen in less than 2 minutes. The broth was fragrant and full bodied with a tasty flavor. The noodles had nice substance to them with just the amount of chewiness. The egg was the perfect texture and absolutely delicious. That little morsel was definitely worth the extra $2. The only component of the soup that did not thrill me was the pork belly. It has absolutely no flavor. Yes on the expensive side but I expect that in NYC especially in the theater district. \xa0Other Yelp reviews mentioned that Kuro Obi is related to Ippudo a ramen chain with a location in the same area. \xa0Their prices are even more expensive but a place I would also like to try on a future visit to NYC.' u"Great lunch place for a casual quick meal. It's like everyone said from the Ippudo company of restaurants and the quality is better than most ramen in the city. There are not many choices  about 3-4 types of broth and meat at any given point but I enjoy getting it every so often. I got the clear pork broth but I forgot what it was called - it may be a new addition to the menu. It's savory but not as rich as the creamy broths which is perfect for me!" u'I actually really like it here which is not something I say often for a food place located right near Times Square. But the food is really good. I tend to play around and choose a different menu item each time with extra pork. It\'s pretty reasonably priced I say this because (A) it\'s Ramen (B) it\'s in Manhattan and (C) it\'s like RIGHT in Times Square/Theatre District. Water\'s free. There\'s also beer and sake. \xa0Staff is pretty friendly. This is like one of the only places I eat in this "market" (the other being the doughnut stand DOUGH). Ippudo stans this place is a direct spin-off of Ippudo. I think it\'s still pretty good but to each their own I don\'t know to what extent any of you would like this place.For City Kitchen in general: If you can try to show up off-peak. It tends to get pretty crowded before and after Broadway shows and especially when Times Square is crowded (you know what I mean) you can expect this place to be.' u"City Kitchen is a great spot to meet up with someone for lunch especially at Kuro Obi as long as you don't mind a slightly longer wait time and shelling out $15. Just because Kuro Obi is Ippudo's take out cousin doesn't mean you should take it to go especially when you don't have an excuse given the ample amount of seating in the Row NYC hotel lobby connected to City Kitchen.Now onto the food: the menu is extremely simple and focuses on chicken-based broth. For those who can never decide which toppings will transform your bowl to other-worldly status this is the ideal menu. Three pre-configured bowls to choose from and only three add-ons since each bowl comes with a handful of toppings including char-siu pork. And oh my god do not forget the egg. It was absolutely perfect and is the principal reason I'll keep coming back despite the egregious 10-15 minute wait for a bowl of soup (seriously Totto churns out bowls of ramen in half the time)." u"Kuro-Obi is from the same people as Ippudo which is pretty divisive when it comes to ramen. But I thought Kuro-Obi was fine and you don't have to put up with an obnoxious wait. There are limitations to being in an abbreviated kitchen but that's to be expected in a food court.Their available ramen types aren't that different from each other at least by description. I tried the Kuro Modern which was pork and chicken broth with pork belly chashu. Thought it was fine but nothing special. Not that overpriced at $13 as you would probably pay about that much if not a dollar or two more at a real restaurant.All in all Kuro-Obi is a good attempt at ramen but I won't be rushing to return anytime soon." u"Pretty good Ramen albeit in a Paper bowl \xa0but being that it's a child of Ippudo.. it was good.my ADHD + Impatience+ Torential downpour on Wednesday afternoon led me to rush my slurp. \xa0I didn't stir shit up before I dug in. I went HARD getting 2 eggs. \xa0about 1/4 of the way through I did a big stir and dredged up about 4 oz of Salty Soy....ruining my rushed lunch but that's on me though.... \xa0 \xa0regardless not a bad Food court Ramen. Can't say run to it but it will do in a pinch when it's raining too hard or if you don't have enough time to hit up Ippudo West Side or Toto while in Hell's Kitched."]
141.Maoz Falafel & Grill,[u"Great concept! You order the base and add the veggies yourself. Not the very best falafels I've had but they were beyond decent. A bit hard to eat after stuffing the pita and it's bound to get messy. I have to say one thing about this place: GET THE SWEET POTATO FRIES ($3.95)! Oh.my! The best fries I've had in a long time. Super fresh and crispy. The garlic sauce was also bomb. The place is good for a quick and low key lunch." u"Now I know why there was such a long line. None of the staff seem to know what they're supposed to do. Disappointing because they do have good food." u"I have decided I will be healthy LMAO so I was in midtown everywhere and there were pizzas everywhere and i was so close to getting a pizza. But I was like hell no you are getting a salad. Except they were all super expensive in all the places like $9 and thats not including the toppings. I saw Maoz and their salad bar and the price isnt so bad $6 for the basic salad. \xa0They also have pita with all the toppings and hummus bowl. If you want to add protein its extra I went with Falafel because I never tried it and i don't eat meat also.The salad was packed into a pretty big bowl and the salad bar have lots of options like coleslaw broccoli onions etc. I pretty much packed everything onto my salad because i paid for it and im going to GET MY MONEY WORTH LOL! The guy in front of me kept staring at my mountain pile of salad compared to his half full salad he just filled up. I was like dude what are you doing get more lol.Oveall the salad was good not mind blowing of of course because i just threw everything on there. BUt this is a place with a good price for their food. I am always in midtown for auditions and rehearsals so i will definitely be back to try their other times. Like the hummus bowl.**They have green chillie sauce and i love that! spicy!**" u"I love love love this concept. It's essentially a Subway but Middle Eastern style. You start with what bowl you want - pita hummus etc. Then add your protein and get unlimited veggies. I opted for the hummus bowl - which was a lot of hummus. As in a two person amount. So if your with someone I would recommend sharing and the other person order the pita or something! I then went for the chicken shwarama and it was again really good. Although I also wish I had ordered some falafels on the side which you can do. The veggies were self service which I really liked it - as you can pick exactly how much you want. I went for a Middle Eastern salad carrots broccoli and cucumber and some white salad. There was also some additional dressings to choose from but I didn't try any. They also had lids etc so you could take out if needed. I'm really glad Shake Shack next door had a queue out the door that was snacking. A much healthier option which I really enjoyed for my first meal in the big city." u"While visiting New York I noticed Maoz while walking from the hotel to work. Admittedly I didn't even think of trying it out but the glowing reviews won me over. I came for lunch and ordered a Chicken Pita. In hindsight to maximize the experience here I should have ordered as a rice bowl and not a pita. There are so many tasty free salads and sauces options available at their bar I just couldn't add everything I wanted to a pita. They also sell juices like Orange and Carrot. Just know that drinking pure carrot juice might make your lips orange for a while.Tip - If you do get the rice bowl take a risk and try several of their unique free options including the cilantro sauce." u'Maoz came highly recommended to me by my friends studying in Columbia back in 2010. On my recent trip to NY I had to investigate what the fuss was all about. We walked up to the location near Columbia but sadly it was no longer open. So we marched off to Times Square - short walk subway another short walk. And there it was! The brand is no longer vegetarian only which was a little disappointing for the vegan in me. However the Columbia alums re-assured that this felt like the same old Maoz. There was also a vegan rice pudding on the new menu!I was overjoyed at the prospect of unlimited toppings. I helped myself with a ton of chickpea salad purple cabbage tabouleh and an assortment of other veggies. On top of this went the amazing mango chutney and tahini. One of the best falafel bowls hands down. Loved it so much went there for brunch the next day. Maoz you made my NY trip even more memorable and inexpensive!' u"This place was great as far as food goes. It tasted very good and it was reasonably priced. The location was convenient too! So I really liked that.What was actually pretty cool was the wide variety of free toping you can add to your food. It makes for a different meal every time.Another thing I really liked was the look and feel of the place. It had nice d\xe9cor and it felt very unique and homey. The only complain I have about this place was the staff. They weren't very friendly and they were talking with each other the entire time. So that's the only downfall in my opinion." u"This is actually one of my favorite spots to have a healthy lunch in the entire city. Price-wise it cannot be beat and as long as you take full advantage of the Maoz topping's bar you will NOT leave hungry. This specific Maoz location is different than others due to the fact that this spot isn't vegetarian. There are still the ordinary vegetarian options that the other Maoz spots offer but there are also things for us meat eaters to enjoy.My first visit to Maoz I got a mixed greens bowl with beef shawarma avocado and an egg as my add-ons. This made my entire order about $12? Second time around was about the same price except that time I got chicken shawarma avocado and babaganoush on top of my salad bowl. If you kept it simple a bowl or pita with a protein you wouldn't spend more than $10. I personally like putting more so I don't mind dishing out a few more bucks especially since every add-on is unbelievably fresh. I will say that the chicken shawarma is better than the beef but the beef is still good. And they're made fresh from the kitchen! Just expect a bit of a wait if you do order a protein (5-10 minutes in my experience). Now I can eat a LOT so I was surprised when these veggie based meals satisfied me. Of course that had a lot to do with the toppings bar. There's something for everyone. And you can pile on as much as you can fit. My personal go-to's are olives chickpea salad beet salad and the tabouli salad. They also have a wide range of sauces. My favorites being their cilantro sauce (on the bar) and garlic sauce (in a bottle). I've tried their tahini but it's not the best. \xa0The ordering system might be a bit confusing initially but once you've got the hang of it nothing will be easier. Walk over to the register order your rice/hummus/salad/pita with or without proteins/add-ons then stand at the front of the toppings bar and wait for them to hand your order to you. The only negative thing I could say about Maoz isn't even really something I can speak about personally. When my boyfriend came with me he ordered a pita with beef shawarma and fries. Now this isn't something I've ever had but he told me this is a pretty normal order in falafel/shawarma spots. Again. I dunno. But he said it wasn't good? But he wasn't very specific. He didn't tell me if it was the pita or the fries or the shawarma. He also hadn't taken my advice to fill up at the toppings bar so his pita looked pretty lackluster (and unhealthy) compared to my salad. He wound up not loving Maoz but his opinion has not changed mine and I've been back plenty of times since. I'm very surprised that this place isn't busier. It's cheap fresh and filling. A better alternative than Chop't or other salad bars in the area. I just wish there was more seating space I've found myself ordering my food to-go and eating elsewhere." u"This is a great place for a quick bite that's fresh and pretty healthy. I had the pita pocket with falafel and it was well under $10. You can stuff the pita with as much chick peas broccoli cucumbers etc as you want which was great. Also tried the mixed fries and they are almost worth the visit alone." u"I like this place and I have been there so many times in the winter for lunch. But today was my second time having stomach troubles after eating at this place in a month! I guess it's probably because the weather got warmer and it's harder to keep the salad fresh in a open place." u'I am absolutely delighted by this fast-casual restaurant.Talk about good wholesome delicious fresh and healthy this place is IT!As someone who prefers meatless options I love every complementary option they had offered! With the Falafel-rice plate you get to choose whatever your heart desires.Olives pickled beets cauliflower/broccoli carrots chickpeas meatless options galore!The sauces were stellar! I can only remember thanking myself for taking a dipping container full of that awesome sauce! Tzatziki is just perfect over anything you choose.I wish that I had more words to say but in reality there were none --just instructions. Step 1. Food in mouth. Step 2. Make heart happy. Step 3. Come back immediately.' u'Not a good food everybody touch the food not a great flavor its much better options to eat in Nyc' u"Ordering is kind of confusing but once you have it down: maoz is your oyster.Stand to the left and order and pay at the register. Pick a delivery mechanism (pita rice bowl hummus bowl salad) pick your protein and any additions and then wait somewhere in between the topping bar and the ordering line.I always get the same thing: brown rice bowl with chicken schwarma with hummus and a whole wheat pita. This is definitely too much food but I can't help myself. I usually load up with pickles broccoli vegetable salad and coleslaw. Last but not least - some tahini on my bowl garlic sauce on my chicken and sriracha on my hummus. And then the feast.Their falafel is really tasty but too much to add on. Would be a good thing to share a side of it." u'Clean and consistant taste! Food is fresh and healthy. Now they fresh green juice! Love Maoz we need one of this in the airport!' u"My favorite lunch spot in this crazy area. The shawarmas are great! And the salad is pretty good. It's definitely a place where you get good value for the price. I have ordered the chicken beef and falafel and they are all pretty good sometimes the steak is overcooked but it is still pretty decent. I love the garlic sauce." u"I'm going 4 stars on this one with the following breakdown:Service: \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 5 starsCleanliness: \xa0 \xa04 starsPrice: \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa05 stars Food Quality \xa0 4 stars I truly enjoyed my first Maoz experience! \xa0The service at this location was first rate! \xa0The person behind the counter taking my order really walked me through the experience. \xa0I'd liken it to a cross between Cava Grill and Amsterdam Falafel. \xa0Ordering is done is stages where you first choose if you want salad grain pita etc. \xa0Then you choose your protein(s). \xa0Last you get your food and navigate the toppings bar. \xa0I chose sweet fries and a hummus bowl with falafel as the protein. \xa0The sweet potato fries were spot on perfect (not greasy served hot outside crispy with inside soft). \xa0The falafel was only ok it lacked that crunchy outer edge (it was soft all the way through). \xa0 \xa0I felt the hummus was good but was grittier than other hummus I've had. \xa0The toppings bar was great. \xa0I love pickles!" u'Price is extremely reasonable and food is fresh! I received my chicken schwarma on a pita with hummus piping hot and was left to add whatever accompaniments and sauces I wanted from the salad bar. This included broccoli and cauliflower tomatoes and red onion tabbouleh olives chickpea salad beet salad and other Mediterranean sides. I was giddy with excitement at the prospect of not being limited to only a few toppings. After a long stretch of walking in the city Maoz Falafel definitely hit the spot and satisfied my need for food in my belly.' u"I run my businesses on service not on attitude. Management needs to hire accommodating and positive people that want to help not a group of rejects who don't give a shit about whether or not customers come back.Food was good. The idea is solid." u'A really really good falafel sandwich close to the theatre district. Good place to run into for a quick meal at 11:00 P.M.Friendly service.Yum' u"I'm so disappointed to write this review because Maoz has been a favorite lunch spot of mine for years and I come to this location at least 2-3x a week. Well not anymore after the experience I suffered a couple of days ago.I got my usual falafel salad which I was happily enjoying until I bit down and tasted GRIT. It tasted like sand from unwashed spinach. This was unpleasant enough but I decided to eat around the spinach hoping to avoid anything else. But nope! In that same salad I found a HAIR that did not belong to me. Absolutely disgusting! The Health Department should pay these guys a little visit and they really need to get their kitchen hygiene together. Sad I can't come here anymore but I think I'm turned off for good."]
10.Junior’s Restaurant,[u'Great service Good food -- burger was good highly recommend the mac n cheese it was amazing!!Awesome cheesecake (we got plain) Prices make sense Good for kids' u'I gave this place 4 stars mainly for the great service we received from Stephani and for the absolutely best chocolate mousse cheesecake I have ever had. \xa0EVER!!! \xa0The piece was huge and we split it between the four of us. \xa0The rest of the food was okay. \xa0I would definitely hit this place up for cheesecake while in Times Square but I do recommend that you skip the meal. Cheesecake for dinner all around!!! \xa0:)' u'Ordered roast half chicken. It was dry. Onion rings: it was crispy. YumVelvet cheesecake: velvet cake layer was soft and light. I like it but cheesy layer was unexpectedly not yummy as i expected.' u"Combo corned beef & pastrami Ruben ($17) additional toast ($1.50) fries ($5) coke ($2.25) total of aprox $25 was plenty of food of 2 people. Loved the cabbage pickles & beets served at the table as an app free of charge. Used the dial-in wait list (arrive within 30 min) and the wait was nil. Service was on point. We liked it! Would return.Don't forget to checkout the cheesecake! We got strawberry & carrot cake cheese cake. Strawberry is much better." u"Stop reading and just go....it's all good! 3 of us went and spilt the following dishes. All I would highly recommend. We had the Ruben Pulled Pork Original Cheesecake Red Velvet Cheesecake and the Coconut Lemon Layered Cake. Oh so delicious. Fast service worth the wait!" u'Junior\'s! How iconic that name is...that is if you were a fan of "Making the Band 2" where Diddy made "Da Band" do that infamous trek from Bad Boy Records all the way to the original location of Junior\'s for a slice of cheesecake. I was not in the mood to travel all the way to Brooklyn on a hot humid NYC afternoon so I settled for the Times Square location.I ended up bringing home a raspberry cheesecake so I can lounge around my sister\'s AC\'ed apartment and unwind. First thing I noticed about the cheesecake was the crust. Its definitely not like the traditional graham cracker crust a la Cheesecake Factory. Instead it was a light cakey crust which I adored! I know many are partial to the graham cracker crust but sometimes I feel it can either take away from the cheesecake or it can be a pain to cut off a piece of that cheesecake with a plastic fork...yes I am that person that is prone to breaking plastic forks due to hard cheesecake crust.The rest of the cheesecake was tasty not too dense but creamy and balanced. That made me happy with my impulsive decision to buy a whole raspberry cheesecake to savor during my week in NYC.' u'The food was okay. The service was poor. Waited for finding someone else to fill my water glass. The husband and wife family arrived later than us and was served before us with lots of attention. Apparently the waitress doesn\'t realize that women have cash too and spending power. Made the whole "Juniors Restaurant" dining just worst. My eldest daughter raved about this place. I\'m saying I don\'t want to return. 100$ bill for lack luster service and just fair food. Find another place to spend your hard earned cashOh! And the carry out wasn\'t closed properly so the freaking food and red beet juice was all over our clothes and bed I set it on not realizing after waking back. #lazy' u'Overly rated. \xa0Place is cool but my service and breakfast were not. \xa0Hardly any service \xa0the Canadian bacons were burnt and hard around the edge the home fried potatoes tasted stale as they were cooked in old oil. \xa0Just one bad experience.' u"This place is so touristy and American. Nothing was particularly that great except the air conditioning on this very hot summer day. That being said nothing was very bad either.I think if you're not a foreigner you should forego this place as there are nicer places to eat in NYC. The chicken salad was good and the portion was pretty generous. The cheesecake tasted very artificial and we could not finish it due to its high sugar content. The cream cheese was not all that heavenly as described in some reviews but perhaps that's because of my culturally cultivated palate (lol jk). Overall it's JUST OK but I'm glad to have checked it off my bucket list." u"That world famous Junior's Cheesecake! One of the few times a dessert lived up to the hype.They are always featured on food shows for the cheesecake. I did not eat here I just got a cheesecake to go. Really busy and a touristy spot.Strawberry Cheesecake slice - $7.50 - The cheesecake was so creamy and smooth it cut through with a fork really easy. I thought it would be heavy but it was pretty light. The strawberries are a nice contrast in flavor helps cut the thick creamy texture. The entire thing was not overly sweet. Hefty price for a slice but it is pretty big." u'Nice place. 1) It is NY institution near Times Square. 2) Come here for the breakfast it is only thing special. 3) I will recommend the blintz they serve it breakfast and lunch. 4) Next time I will come for their cheesecake.' u'Came here for cheesecake with my daughter on our day trip to NYC. I am not a cheesecake person at all but she wanted to try it to see if it lived up to the hype. She says it did. I observed her throughly enjoying every bite of it. The service at the bakery portion of the restaurant (separate) was small and crampedbut the associates at the counter were fast but not rude in taking orders to get folks in and out. The strawberry cheesecake she got costs around $8 and we also purchased a cupcake with rainbow sprinks for around $4. She said it was well worth it. On our next visit l may splurge for a piece of key lime pie.' u"If you're looking for a place to grab dessert after seeing a show in the city this is the place! My only complaint would be the long wait to get a table (understandable) and there being some delays with service (also understandable). We chose to wear jackets and sit outside and really enjoyed being on the patio area; it was quieter than the inside space and it was as quiet as a NYC street can be. We decided to split the strawberry cheese piered velvet layer cake chocolate cake and onion rings (dinner of champions). Everything was awesome. We particularly liked the thick batter on the onion rings and the strawberries were really fresh and delicious. Overall this place is a home run if you are OK with the wait!" u"I really wanted to like Junior's. When you walk up it is busy and has a great vive by the theatre district. The workers are friendly and helpful. They are known for their cheesecakes. I ended up getting a pastrami/corned beef sandwich in their take out area. I guess I expected more. Being that I am a fan of kosher deli's in NYC I expected a more hearty sandwich with ample meat. Nope. Meat was also not as flavorful." u"A friend brought me to the bakery for cheesecake....seeing the amount of people and being this area I was afraid it might be a tourist trap.Nope. \xa0It was great.I got the carrot cake cheesecake and it was rich not too sweet. Extremely smooth but without being raw. The carrot cake here is a little spicier than what I'm used to but paired with that cheesecake it was perfect.Decadent. \xa0Not something I'd eat everyday!I could probably get 3 sittings out of this slice. \xa0We sat outside part of the bakery seating (not restaurant). \xa0Also worth noting is the staff was surprisingly friendly even with the amount of rush they get.It's expensive (about 8 for a slice!) which inhibited me from taking anything else to try however tempting but worth trying once." u"So my mom is a huge fan of their cheesecake. \xa0The plain. \xa0It doesn't need to be enhanced with more sweets. \xa0I swung by here to pick up a cake. \xa0You save a lot of money picking it up rather than ordering online. \xa0They always have a variety of cakes ready to go.For lunch I had corned beef reuben. \xa0It wasn't cheap was small (compared to the local Jewish delis) meat was mediocre at best and didn't come with any sides. \xa0I didn't even get offered pickles and cole slaw. I ordered a side of onion rings. \xa0They were mostly dough.For dessert I had a brownie with ice cream. \xa0It was so yummy! \xa0The brownie was even warm. \xa0Service was mediocre at best. \xa0I had to beg for a refill on the soda. \xa0We may come back for dessert but just dessert." u"We came here just to try the cheesecake as loads of people had told me it was the 'best in NY' and it didn't disappoint!Although on the pricey side the slices are huge and big enough to share between 2. The cheesecake is SO rich I think it would be difficult to eat one to yourself! It really is delicious and although a complete tourist trap I think it is worth a visit if you're in the area." u"It's was a drizzling morning and I realize I was waking in front of the big Junior's on 44th Street and Times Square knowing I need to try the Cheese Cake that is so famous. Seeing only two people at the take out counter meant I could grab a fast one. \xa0They have two display cases one with cup cake size and huge slices size. \xa0I went for a slice of Red Velvet cheese cake they come in a clear plastic container at only $7:50 considering the size of the silce this is cheaper than a lot of places. I cut about 1/3 of the slice since to eat and have with coffee and still my 1/3 slice still feels like a pound of cheese cake. Definitively this is a New York cheese cake and the taste was good and rich with tree layers of heavy cheese cake Red Velvet cake and a lighter creamier cheese cake. My i/3 slice was filling I ate some more during the day but could not finish it.This cake is a 100% diet buster. I will go back and try some of the other cheese cakes but I grab a cup cake size one next time." u"My new yorker friend brought me here for good cheesecake. Seems like a tourist trap. Cheesecake wasn't that great either." u"AMAZING MEAL BUT EVEN BETTER CHEESECAKE.I had just salad for 9.95 and it was massive!! My dad had a pastrami stake burger. He loved it. Finally we HAD to try their cheese cake but we love carrot cake and so the carrot cheesecake was the best of BOTH worlds. (Just like Hannah Montana) It was their famous cheesecake in the outer slices mixed with carrot cake in the inner slices. Both were beyond amazing. By far the best cheese I've had. ***MUST try their cheesecake."]
151.Pietrasanta,[u"I ordered delivery last night and the food was delivered hot and fairly quickly. The minestrone was great and the chicken parm was crunchy on the outside but moist on the inside. However the portion size was smaller than pictures of the food on yelp indicated and smaller than I would have expected given the price point of this restaurant. Also they have a VERY heavy hand with garlic in their tomato sauce. I love garlic but woah. I'd definitely order from here again.-1 star for portion size and overbearing garlic" u'Found this spot walking down 9th ave. delicious food and very attentive service. Definitely a great find!' u'Give this place a try! The Italian here is great! I came with my family around the holidays and we were not disappointed. Delicious food and moderately priced. They have a smaller wine list but have specials on the house wine.' u"Great food - especially pastas! Nice staff very clean bathroom (it's very important for me) Well it was one of the best dining experience in NYC. Definitely worth your time and money!" u"Stopped in on Mother's Day for dinner without a reservation after a show and the hostess graciously found us a table. \xa0Unfortunately the food was well below par. \xa0I had the special veal piccata which though tasty was not tender at all. \xa0 That was nothing however compared to the inedible chicken parmesan my son ordered. \xa0I was surprised when after a few bites he pushed his plate away. \xa0I tried a piece and quickly understood. \xa0No chewiness or taste at all. \xa0Must have been a bad piece of chicken because it was something more than tough. \xa0It actually broke into pieces when I bit into it. \xa0It was literally like plastic encased in breadcrumbs. \xa0 Disappointing because the sauce was very good. \xa0To the manager's credit when told he took the dish away and did not charge us. \xa0But our dinner was not very good at all." u"Small intimate Italian restaurant just outside the theater district with great homemade pasta. \xa0On a nice day they open the folding doors across the front of the restaurant facing a light on 9th. Busses park directly in front and the traffic is loud and horns are blazing constantly. You have to shout to talk across the table. We could barely hear the waiter. Then there's the truck fumes.It's probably very nice here in the winter when the doors are closed but not for me on a nice day." u'Good choice when looking for old school Italian in theater district. Everyone in group enjoyed their meal (osso bucco shrimp risotto baby octopus minestrone beet salad and organic greens salad). I had the baby octopus and it was in a tasty olive tomato sauce. Interior could use an update but service and food is much better than most restaurants in area. Good choice if you are seeing a show on 47th as it is on corner of 47th & 9th.' u"Took my two visiting daughters and three visiting grandchildren to Broadway to see a matinee. Afterwards \xa0we moseyed the few blocks over to Pietrasanta. This restaurant is perfectly located for pre or post theater. It's a comfortable place for well-behaved kids the pasta is homemade and the service is friendly and efficient (they recognize their theater niche). The ambience is basic NYC/Italian chic with folding outdoor walls that give you the feeling of being outdoors. And lastly the prices are reasonable." u'Another nice Italian restaurant conveniently located to the theater district.We were seated promptly at 6:00pm which was plenty of time to enjoy a nice meal before catching a show at 8:00pm. In fact it seemed as though the host was ONLY letting in folks who had a reservation to the restaurant so keep that in mind especially on busy weekend nights (we went in on a Friday).For dinner I had the orecchiette pugliese ("little ears" pasta broccoli rabe pecorino and sausage in a garlic wine sauce) and it was really delicious. The sauce was nice and light and the broccoli rabe tasted really fresh and not overly bitter. The caesar salad and bread I had on the side were equally good but the main course really stole the show.Overall a nice meal. Would certainly return again.' u"I was the only one in the restaurant having lunch at 2pm on a Wednesday. \xa0They brought out bread with balsamic and olive oil dipping sauce. \xa0I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta with tomatoes and asparagus. \xa0It was ok but nothing spectacular and the shrimp was a little overcooked. \xa0Service was good. \xa0I sat in the patio and witnessed some New York road rage but that was not the restaurant's fault." u'It was packed when we got there around 745pm. We enjoyed a bottle of wine and I got the spinach fettuccini with egg plant and tomato sauce instead of mushrooms I asked for spinach. My boyfriend got the Alfredo. They were really accommodating with food. The atmosphere was nice and simple but cute. Also the owner was walking around and made sure each person enjoyed themselves. It was great. I think our bus boy was having a rough day so he was a little moody but over all I loved the food and the over all experience.' u"This is a terrific little restaurant just a couple of blocks from the Theatre District that us perfect for a pre-show dinner (although worth going to any time). We had pasta dishes salads ravioli... All wonderful fresh and flavorful. Service was attentive and friendly and they had great sangria (bonus!). One point off for the interior which needs freshening but it's clean and warm and pleasant." u"Read a few of the other reviews and I have to agree when entering the restaurant the smell is awful! \xa0For some reason my chicken was extra chewy this visit and the service was horrendous! Waiter Pedro seemed more interested in his friend outside the restaurant versus telling us what the soup of the day was. \xa0Wish we had the other waiter not Pedro! This is the second time we've received poor service from the same waiter Pedro! Don't plan on patronizing this establishment again!" u'i have only been here once (so far) best little Italian place i have been to in this area i got the salmon and it was very good. table are small and u have very little space between your table and the ones next to you .. I plan to return Food- excellent service- excellent atmosphere - good ( not enough space )' u'Pietrsanta describes itself as "rustic" and "homey." \xa0But anyone using those words relative to this restaurant is either blinded by aspirational thinking or simply unfamiliar with the English definition of the words because it is anything but. Putting aside the noxious smell upon entering the bus boy doubling as a bartender eating a banana behind the bar (putting his half eaten banana and floppy peal down on the bar while mixing a sangria-like concoction for an unsuspecting couple being served rose like wine with fruit spooned into it from a Tupperware as the bar tender also nibbles on the fruit that dropped into the bar) the bathroom whose faucet just spontaneously burst and sprayed water on my daughter the wine list that boasts Yellowtail and other liter size bottles of delectable swill (there is one Pinot Grigio and a Chianti on their list which I guess is their homage to Italy) the fact that no one there seems to have any relation to Italy (except in so far as Cortez and Vespucci were both explorers of the Americas) the lousy food the stark and cold ambiance - I don\'t even think there was a cheesy picture of a gondola cheap laminated wood tables no music and an empty cafeteria style furniture arrangement I feel genuine sorrow for anyone who has given this place more than one star as their previous dinning experiences must be appalling \xa0horrific. Worth also noting that it\'s not close to being in the heart of the theater district as self described unless that term includes aspiring actors who share the neighborhood with bums and ruffians while living in shared studio apartments just scraping by in Hell\'s Kitchen hoping for their big break. Summarily - \xa0I see no redeeming quality to this restaurant and my head spins when I read the positive reviews here.' u'I had wonderful complete dinner here on \xa0a cold winter night last January.The service was friendly and prompt.I enjoyed salad pasta wtih clams and dessert. I thought for a Manhattan Restaurant the price was reasonable.' u"Excellent food and very comfortable despite the summer heat. The host and staff makes you feel at home. I had a generous portion of chicken parmigian a nice ceasar salad and tasty gazpacho soup! \xa0Their espresso beats starbucks across the street. The price is not bad if you're looking for a quality dining experience. I give it 5 stars!" u'Heard this was the place to eat before leaving New York. So ate here...had Risotto it was good. Sangria...ok. Service...not 18% worth.' u"It's not that the food is bad... it was quite acceptable. But noatmosphere. Place was like a tomb with indifferent staffLots more interesting good restaurants to try than this place" u"Food was great but the service was a bit lacking. I had the caesar salad followed by the Pollo Pietrasanta. The caesar was amazing and the pollo pietrasanta had a great flavor to it. The drinks were a bit off - I first ordered a mojito which did not taste good at all so I sent it back - I then ordered a gin and tonic which although it tasted okay was extremely strong and kind of took me out. It was hard to drink it was so strong! The server was kind of fly-by-night at times. He was not there when we needed him and drinks took way too long to get. However it wasn't a huge deal to me at the time because I was feeling pretty good from that strong drink!"]
81.Le Bernardin,[u"This is the 2nd time I have been here. Loved it the first time and the 2nd did not disappoint.Using my 5 star rating (1 star for each category): Atmosphere (1) - so pretty inside.Food (1) - got the chefs tasting menu. Caviar was sublime perfectly salty and the cr\xe8me fresh added the brightness it needed. Lobster was perfectly cooked and the consume with it was so flavorful that I made sure I ate every drop in the bowl. Same w the langoustine w foie perfectly cooked and the sauce was so different than anything we ate. Salmon we both agreed was our least favorite dish. Everything else was ridiculous good. Kobe and tuna were both melt in your mouth and the dessert was fabulous.Service (.5) - first let me say our servers at dinner were so great - fun and professional (I would give them 10 stars). BUT when we made the reservation we were told you have to be out by 8 pm because they have another reservation. I HATE that. Some people don't mind I get that but for me you are airing your dirty laundry and if I am paying $400 (including tip and wine) for a meal I don't want to feel rushed. When you tell me I need to leave by 8 and there is a huge gap between courses I start to worry. I finally said something to our server that we were told we have to leave by 8 and of course he was great and said not to worry but the fact I felt compelled to say something to him says everything. Would I go back (1) - yes! Whenever I am in New York.Would I recommend (1) - yes4.5 stars" u"Places like this are reserved for special occasions. Which is why the only time I've eaten here which was for a birthday a few years back. It was fabulous.The service at Le Bernardin is impeccable and they love people who clearly have fun and get excited about beautiful food. The chefs and staff here are craftsman. Each dish is exquisitely constructed and they all tasted as good as they were presented. It was over a 3 hour dining experience. I think we got about four rounds of desserts with our meal. None of us could eat another bite by the second dessert but we desperately tried to make it through all the desserts as they were too stunning to leave untouched. A meal I will not forget. We also asked for a tour of the kitchen which was very nice of the staff to let us behind the scenes. If you would like to know Eric keeps a clean kitchen." u"My wife and I have traveled extensively and have dined at some of the world's finest restaurants. So it is from this very experienced viewpoint that I offer this review. \xa0The restaurant is nicely furnished and conveniently located. \xa0The service is good and the atmosphere is what you'd expect at \xa0 Micheline star rated restaurant. \xa0Now the food. Again I'm comparing this restaurant to ones on the same level - eg PerSe Stone Barnes etc. At best I'd say the food was okay certainly not worth money but better than an average restaurant. \xa0I was prepared to be amazed as one would expect of a restaurant of that caliber but I was only mildly amused. I also had the unfortunate experience of having a glass break in my hand and contents spill all over me. \xa0The crew were very quick to respond - changed everything on the table while we waited in the lounge. \xa0Typically when this sort of thing happens you'd expect the restaurant to offer to pay for the dry cleaning. No such thing here. \xa0To add insult to injury not only did the argue with my wife as to the cause of the incident claiming that I somehow caused but also charged us for the drink. \xa0This was a huge treat for us as we can afford but once a year to spend $200 per plate on dinner. And overall I'd say it was disappointment." u"Before this meal I have never been to a 2 or 3 star Michelin place. I opted for the alcohol pairing which was also my first time. Attire is dressy and jackets are mandatory. The pre-meal starter was a chimichurri tuna tartare and avocado vegetable roll. Excellent way to begin the meal. King fish caviar - sake pairing. Sake really enhanced the fish flavor and the fish itself was fantastic. Caviar flavor is very settle and hard to taste. Lobster - This sauce is amazing and best lobster I've ever had. The champagne really brought out the flavor in the lobster. 5/5Langostine and foie gras paired very well with the Riesling. Langostine and foie gras were very soft. I tried each one individually and then together and it tasted fantastic. Riesling brought out the flavor in both. 5/5Salmon was slightly fatty and very tasty although the Chardonnay didn't pair very well 4/5.Halibut was so soft and moist throughout. The mushroom soup paired very well with the halibut. 5/5Pinot noir pairing was odd. Didn't think they would pair a red wine with a fish. Wagyu beef and white tuna was very tasty. Wagyu was pretty fatty and the White tuna was medium soft. Barolo paired alright Roasted pineapple guava jam Yuzu coconut sorbet was so airy and very light. This dessert paired quite well with the wine. 5/5Coffee caramel almond mousse had a wafer that was so tasty. Almond mousse wasn't too sweet which is just the way I like it. The highlight of this course was the dessert wine that was paired with the meal. Service here is top notch and didn't expect any less. They even bring out little stools for holding bags and purses. Overall very enjoyable meal. Excellent food with great company is always a recipe for a fantastic time." u'My first Michelin starred dining experience! It\'s also #24 on The World\'s 50 Best Restaurants list. I was super excited to be dining here even though our reservations were at 10:45- the last time slot. My friend and I came here after watching a play that ran a little long and practically ran here before they closed at 11:00. We ordered from the prix-fixe menu- 4 courses for $147. At the beginning of the meal we were served bread. I know I shouldn\'t fill up on bread but the rosemary olive focaccia was really good with the soft butter. Then we were given three different amuse-bouches. For my courses I had tuna scallop white tuna-Japanese wagyu and matcha (dessert). My favorite was the tuna. At the end we had petit fours. Even though it was four courses+ it was a light meal. Service was great from beginning to end. We were well taken care of and were also given an extra dessert. I also love that the restaurant offer a variety of menus in the dining room and lounge so more people can get the opportunity to dine here without breaking the bank.*Seven James Beard Awards since 1998 including "Outstanding Restaurant of the Year" "Top Chef in New York City" "Outstanding Service" "Outstanding Chef in the United States" "Outstanding Pastry Chef" "Outstanding Wine Service" and "Best Restaurant Design." [As Seen on Best Thing I Ever Ate and No Reservations]' u'I had a 1045pm reservation but there was still a lot of people here just about to or just started eating as well. It\'s one big open space with the dining area and bar lounge area so it\'s loud. I\'m sure you can make this an intimate night but don\'t count on it.Either way I still had a great time here. I did the tasting menu and it was fabulous. My favorite was the halibut with mushroom and the "Apple" dessert.Le Bernardin really lives up to their reputation. Even dining by myself at 1045pm I didn\'t feel rushed or anything. There was no feeling of I can\'t wait to go home kind of feeling from the staff...especially when it\'s past 1am. And as for the bar...they have some really top shelf stuff. You can get fancy drunk here.' u"Came here spontaneously with a friend one night. We weren't sure if we were going to get seated since we were dressed down and after all this is a 3 star Michelin restaurant. We wanted to sit in the lounge area and lucky for us it was not a problem :) \xa0I was super excited I never been to LB before. Upon walking in the restaurant is beautiful spacious and intimate.. let's just say we were really under dressed especially for the dining area.The service was exceptional definitely one of the best experiences I've had in a really long time (I need to fine dine more). They really make you feel special here and everything is timed perfectly (when the food comes out when they take your plate and etc). We ordered a few items off the menu - the Lobster Cappuccino Peruvian Style Scallop Ceviche Kanpachi Tartare Apricot dessert and the Tres Leches dessert. Everything was unique flavorful and presented beautifully. Each plate really brought out all the flavors in every ingredient and dining here really expanded my palate. The Apricot dessert had roasted apricot caramelized honey cremeux and osmanthus blossom sorbet. The Tres Leches was my favorite dessert - crisp cashew sponge cake sphere caramelized goat's milk mouse and clementine sorbet.The Lobster Cappucino was earthy tasting but in a good way and it really was like drinking a cappuccino with Celeriac Soup and Perigord Truffle topped with Lobster foam. I had to order the scallop ceviche because I love scallops and I never had it in a ceviche and was probably my favorite food item of the night. Served in a beautiful shell it was really refreshing and light. My friend and I have actually tried to replicating this recipe at home since dining here since we loved it so much. The Kanpachi was topped with wasabi tobiko with an emulsion of ginger and coriander was very enjoyable as well.What I love about this Le Bernardin is they switch up the menu so it gives me all the reason to come back to try new items. If you love seafood you absolutely need to visit Le Bernardin. \xa0Every bite tastes better than the last and you want to eat it very slowly to enjoy it for as long as possible. Definitely expensive but it's about the quality here not the quantity and places like LB just makes me appreciate food so much more. Can't wait to come back and next time I'll be checking out the dining area." u'Summary: Likely the best restaurant that I\'ve been to so far in my life. There\'s a reason this place tops many best restaurant lists every year. Without a doubt the best seafood that I\'ve had.Went here for dinner while visiting NYC. Of all the meals I had in NYC and across the globe this place is probably the best. Seafood prepared with the highest quality ingredients and executed perfectly. The food:We did the three course price fixe menu. Everything we had was absolutely delicious. I won\'t mention everything we ate because it was a lot but I will point out the things that you must try.SEAFOOD TRUFFLE PASTA - order this without hesitation. This is probably the single most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my life. Fresh pasta perfectly al dente with generous portions of crab scallop lobster and black truffle. They finished it off with some black truffle butter. So rich so delicious. Impossible to convey how good this was. Black bass "surf and turf" - Crispy black bass with braised cheek. Perfectly crispy fish skin seasoned to perfection. The smokiness of the braised veal cheek gave a great balance to the dish.All the desserts - So we ordered three desserts and they brought out five. Awesome. They said the other ones were on the house. If memory serves correct we had:PERUVIAN CHOCOLATE - Warm Chocolate Cake Caramelized Fig Spiced Chocolate Ice CreamMANGO - Mango Parfait Hazelnut Dacquoise Thai Basil-Mango EmulsionMATCHA - Green Tea Custard Preserved Lychee Jasmine Ice CreamEXOTIC FRUIT "PAVLOVA" - Roasted Pineapple Guava Jam Yuzu-Coconut SorbetWe were also served a chocolate bourbon box dessert that was not on the menu. In addition they serve petit fours at the end. Everything was so incredible and it was so nice of them to give us all of these desserts to try. The service: exactly what you would expect from a three michelin star restaurant. Service was impeccable and absolutely top notch in every way. Overall: possibly the best restaurant that I\'ve been to. Can\'t wait to go back. If you go you must order the seafood truffle pasta. It\'s the real deal.' u"Five Stars for service Five stars for taste five stars for making us feel welcome and special. Portion size five stars and selections five stars. It is hard to find anything wrong with tonight's meal. I won't sleep tonight I'm so full! \xa0I've got a couple more photos on my daughters camera. There were so many courses I can't remember all the names. They asked up front about my allergies. I feel comfortable knowing my food was prepared with my health in mind. They even have a little stool to put your handbag on instead of on the floor! Lovely atmosphere not overly gaudy. I'm definitely not a food review writer. This was a once in a lifetime experience for me!!Thanks to everyone involved for a memorable evening. My photos will have to tell the story....." u"If you're a college student like I am - GET THE CITY HARVEST LUNCH PRIX FIXE!Such a great deal at $49 for 3 courses.The service was exceptional and the flavors and textures were delicate. I'm not usually a seafood fan but I enjoyed my lobster carrot soup and even my friends' scallops. I got the sea bass for my main and tried the Merluza as well. Larger pieces of fish than I expected and the sauces were exquisite. Can't wait to come back again to try the full tasting menu" u"This was simply the best meal of my life. I had long desired to go to a 3 Michelin starred restaurant and when my wife and I came to NYC for our fifth anniversary Le Bernardin was definitely on our list. We ordered the Le Bernardin tasting menu with wine pairing. It was worth every last penny. The food was phenomenal and each dish surprised you with something - not something lavish or out of the ordinary even but with how profoundly good it was. One of the big shocks for me was how extraordinarily well each wine paired with the meal. Aldo Sohm is a genius. This took what was already an excellent meal and made it simply phenomenal. I can't afford to eat at Le Bernardin often but when I do have the spare money it is going to be high on my list - even before trying other restaurants. I enjoyed it that much. As a final note I am not a seafood person. I almost didn't go to Le Bernardin precisely because I am a serious meat eater. This would have been a tragic mistake. Try Le Bernardin - I challenge anyone to eat that crusted snapper and not fall in love." u"KenScale: 9.0/10After checking out countless fine dining establishments throughout New York and beyond there were moments that I would tire of haute cuisine. Sometimes simplicity pays off way better with faithfulness to freshness of ingredients and solid execution when I visit restaurants. All this use of emulsion exotic ingredients and fancy cooking techniques may look great in picture but not all restaurants delivered quite the way that I had anticipated. One exception to this evolution of my taste is Le Bernardin and it shows why this perennially famous and rightfully acclaimed restaurant has been in the ultra-competitive New York dining scene for the past 30 years. Chef Eric Ripert doesn't play safe; he surveys the world for more inspiration (last year's NY Times article about his visit to a tiny Buddhist temple in Korea to learn more about the temple cooking from a female monk there is Exhibit A) and brings what he has observed to the table. While the seafood-oriented dishes at Le Bernardin are ostensibly French they draw influences from all over the world. On my last visit for lunch with summer interns at my firm I learned yet again the boundary that the kitchen is willing to push for another spectacular meal.In Le Bernardin's cooking emulsion is the central part of most dishes but that doesn't mean that the kitchen pays less attention to the main seafood. They care deeply about the quality of ingredients and make sure that the texture of seafood combined with the surrounding emulsion work together harmoniously. The barely cooked scallop had one of the most memorable textures in scallop as far as I can remember and combined with roasted bone marrow and calamansi-butter emulsion had impeccable elegance to flavor. As I tried bite after bite there was always something new to my taste bud that I couldn't quite pinpoint but was nevertheless stupendously wonderful. When you see seared cod coming from the kitchen you see all these cute little pieces of daikon-green papaya salad followed by Japanese nori-hijiki emulsion that may distract your attention. Yes the dish looks absolutely beautiful but better yet the cod was just cooked to perfection and again the balance of flavor and texture was something that I would not forget for a long time. After capping the meal with mango parfait accompanied by Thai basil-mango emulsion a delightful treat that had the right amount of sweetness to it without overpowering my palate I walked out of the restaurant an extremely happy man. The three-course prix fixe at Le Bernardin which has now gone up from the $70s per person from my previous visits to $85 per person is still one of the best lunch bargains in town if you want to explore the depth of chef Ripert's philosophy to his cooking. Getting the reservation at Le Bernardin is still extremely challenging for dinner but the lunch reservations tend to come by more easily. Too bad it was lunchtime for work functions so I couldn't get a glass of wine to complement this wonderful meal. The dining room still oozed the classical beauty that I remembered on my previous visits. I'm so glad that Le Bernardin is still going as strong as ever; with the passage of time the quality of food at a restaurant tends to suffer as the head chef expands his or her businesses or the insanely fickle New York diners move on to the next hot places. There is a reason that this place remains one of the best dining destinations in the greatest food city of the world." u'Started good and went downhill from there.I opted for the Chefs Tasting menuThe initial dishes of Salmon Tartar of a caviar and seafood parfait was excellent and full of flavor. Then everything went downhill. Dish after dish of bland nearly flavorless food. The salmon and peas tasted more like not quite ripe peas than the large piece of fish that it surrounded. The lobster was extremely tough and took a lot of work to cut through. The Foie Gras had a stringiness that I didn\'t think was possible. Also hard to cut through another thing I didn\'t think was possible. The final dish included a piece of wagyu beef that was both the saltiest toughest and most overcooked piece of wagyu I\'ve ever experienced.The deserts were boring the "coffee" dish tasted nothing like coffee and had a bizarre grainy texture.The alcohol markups are the highest I\'ve ever seen for a restaurant it makes Las Vegas look cheap. The coffee and sparkling water are an additional charge of $7 for a mediocre cappuccino and $9 for 1 liter of pellegrino and gratuity isn\'t included in the price. Checking other reviews from the past week there seems to be a lot of similar sentiment.On the plus side they gave me a copy of NYC Zagat 2016 so I can find a place where I should have gone instead.' u'Le Bernardin had been on our list for a while and last my girlfriend brought me here to check this one off the list and taste some delicious delicious seafood.Before jumping into the food I have to say the plates Le Bernardin uses with the little bubble accents are a nice touch. Would love to buy a few for the house - I\'m guessing they don\'t sell these at IKEA.We opted for the Chef\'s Tasting which currently runs $215 per person. The meal starts with a a trio of amuses (on said bubble plates) - ours featured smoked salmon lobster and watermelon soup. Nice and refreshing and probably meant to foreshadow the seafood-forward plates to come.- Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio; Iberico Ham "Chutney" Sea Beans Lemon-Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Comes out as a circular disk of pounded carpaccio in olive oil. Tuna is delicate and melts in your mouth - the dish is really much smaller than it looks. Good thing there are plenty of courses after this one.- Warm King Fish "Sashimi;" Osetra Caviar Light Marini\xe8re Broth - I think this is one of the restaurant\'s signature dishes and would guess it\'s been on the menu for a while. Flavors are excellent here - I imagine this is what eating straight from the ocean is like. The salty/brininess from the broth and caviar work well with the king fish.- Pan Roasted Langoustine; Foie Gras Soubise Aged Sherry-Verjus Vinaigrette - absolutely one of the best bites of food I\'ve had in my life. The langoustine is absolutely the star and is cooked perfectly. Whether or not you\'ve had langoustine before this dish will make you love it.- Lacquered Lobster Tail; Herb Spring Roll Lemongrass Consomm\xe9 - clever play on the "lobster roll" - you get lobster two ways in this dish: a lobster tail and a sort of lobster sushi roll both sitting in lemongrass broth.- White Tuna Grilled Escolar and Seared Wagyu Beef; Fresh Kimchi Asian Pear Soy-Citrus Emulsion - their form of surf and turf I suppose? Much preferred the beef side of the plate but both were excellent.- Green Tea Custard Preserved Lychee Jasmine Ice Cream - classic Asian-inspired flavors. Very refreshing though - comes topped with these crispy green tea noodles.. best way I can describe them.- Marinated "Golden Blueberries" Frozen Sweet Corn Meringue Blueberry Sorbet - visually this dish looks like the contrast was turned up on the plate with the white sorbet and almost black blueberries some coated in gold coloring.- Semifreddo with chocolate as their version of a birthday cake and a few petits fours to end the meal. I don\'t remember these being too out of the ordinary but I was more than satisfied already at this point.There was a lot of hype surrounding Le Bernardin and expectations were high going in but I\'m happy to say that it lives up to it all. One of my top meals of all time for sure.' u"Let me start the review by saying that this is the nicest restaurant I have ever been to. When I first walked in I was blown away the decor; it feels as if you are in another world when you step into the restaurant off of the street. My favorite feature is the wall length picture of waves which really sets the tone for the meal. The service was outstanding from start to finish. For each dish the waiters swoop in and deliver everything at once applying whatever sauce the dish comes with. Almost every dish if not all of them involve seafood with a large portion of it served raw or close to raw; so if that's not what your into this isn't the spot for you. When we first arrived the waiter brought the table salmon rillete and bread which was a great way to start the meal. For an appetizer I got the crab filled calamari and followed that up with the crusted red snapper. The red snapper was my favorite dish and by far the best fish that I've had in a long time. No dish was less than excellent.At $85 for the lunch prix fixe menu it is rather expensive but if you are willing to pay that you won't be let down." u'Sorry that I could only choose three stars "A-OK" instead of four "a fan" at Yelp.My friend and I tried the brunch there and chose the 85 three-course prix fixe. My friend followed one of the waiters\' recommendation by ordering a black bass tartare a grilled black bass and a strawberry puree (the waiter said the first and second black bass would be different well yes...) and I chose truffle seafood pasta seared cod and exotic fruit dessert.Overall impression of the courses is salty and lack of aesthetic values. Both the black bass tartare and the cod were very salty. The grilled sea bass was nothing more than a piece of grilled bass with some broth. Pasta and desserts were fine. Four stars: truffle seafood pasta. The quantity of truffle and seafood was huge in comparison with the portion of pasta (cuz it is a starter). Taste was good. \xa0Two stars: seared cod. Very salty and do you think it is qualified as a three-star course from the picture? Three stars: exotic fruit dessert. Ok.We were guessing the chef was away during the brunch time but later we saw him in the dining room. Maybe the dinner will be better than the brunch.' u"AHHH possibly the best seafood restaurant I've ever been to. The food was so delicious so pleasing to the eye and the palate! We were expecting a lot from this place based on all the reviews and it being a Michelin Star recipient and we were not disappointed. As soon as we entered we were aware of our ages as the crowd seemed to be a bit on the older side lol. More of a reason for us to feel and act a little immature. Nonetheless after a drink (strong one) we seemed to fit right in (or so we thought). It was a group of 4 so we ordered different drinks from the menu and they all were pretty good. Our food didn't take long to be prepared and served. Every single thing we ate from the beginning to the end was immaculately prepared and exquisite! This is sort of a late review and I'm sure the menu has changed from when we had it about a month ago. I specifically remember all the dishes and the way they tasted it was quite a memorable experience. One thing we were not a fan of were the desserts! We ordered 4 different kinds and none tasted as great as they sounded. The complimentary dessert they give you towards the end (Bonbon Macaroon and this sugar candy) was AMAZING!!! AH I was such a fan of the macaroon!! I could have a bunch of them even after all that dinner! Service & ambiance were great. I've read the previous reviews regarding service being not up to par with the restaurant's standards but I guess they worked on that and we were left with no complaints! Definitely worth going to and worth the money!" u"The Quick: The epitome of classy sophisticated borderline stuffy French restaurants. The food is phenomenal and the service is top notch treating you as if you are the most important customer of the night. Oh... And the price is crazy extravagant. The Details: I cannot say enough about the service and feel about this place. The men had to wear suits and every single woman in the restaurant wore a little black dress. I was wearing a red slinky dress... Oh I got some looks. We did the chefs tasting menu with the wine pairing. Each course was brought out on a unique beautiful plate. Every last detail was elegant. The food was phenomenal as to be expected. The portions were small but we left satisfied. The different breads were delicious but I would recommend only trying one as I was told 'to go' bags are not allowed. The Damage: The chef tasting menu for two with the wine pairing and then additional glasses of cava ~ $800 pre tip... As I said do not go unless you're prepared" u'Great food great service. Expensive. I had the chef tasting. Everything was very good.The stand out dishes were:The lobster in the lemon grass consomme the lobster and consomme were outstanding.The langoustine and fois gras also amazing. The langoustine tasted so good. The white tuna was amazing. I took the servers advice and traded the salmon for a scallop/ langoustine/ pasta truffle dish. It was ok. It was my first time having truffle. I told the waiter it was just ok and they brought me out an additional dish. Amazing service.The halibut texture was also just ok. Would definitely return maybe once a year type place because of the cost.And there is a dress code jacket required. I was not sure about wearing sneakers but I saw someone wearing the.' u"I try not to get political in my Yelp reviews (because that would be pretty weird) but I'll admit it:I'm feeling Le Bern. This place is straight class. For gods' sakes the coat check ticket is metal. They are lucky I didn't steal that thing and melt it down to pay my rent after eating here. Do you think there's a tip jar out for the coat check staff? Absolutely not. This isn't Brooklyn. Here in Midtown there's a wooden slot where I'm pretty sure you're only allowed to drop bills larger than fifties. I didn't jam my hand down it but maybe I should've because this was the fanciest (and most expensive) lunch of my life. And it was good. From the salmon canap\xe9 we started with to the beautiful bottle of wine we settled on (with the help of a lovely sommelier) to the barely touched tuna and the surf and turf of black bass and braised veal cheeks...I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The service is actually perfect. Everyone is warm and so very very competent. As our first courses were delivered I jokingly complained that everyone else had a sauce poured onto their dish but me. Well I'll be damned if some guy didn't appear with a yuzu dashi out of nowhere just for me. I'm pretty sure that sauce was supposed to be on my plate already and was just a step behind but the point is that the staff at Le Bernardin is basically a bunch of seafood fairies floating around and making sure life is delicious. You might be asking yourself why is this glowing review only four stars? [Well stop talking to yourself. It creeps the rest of us out.]The answer is that while everything was quite nice at this price point I essentially expect perfection. I expect to be staggered by my meal. I have been spoiled by the fact that for a third of the cost I can eat a meal at least as delicious at dozens of restaurants around this fine city. Granted the service may not be impeccable and the room may not be as grand but the food matters more to me anyway. Perhaps it's just that the level of cooking elsewhere has risen dramatically but the only bites that truly blew me away at Le Bernardin were dessert (and I'm not even really into dessert). I'm not sure who their pastry chef is but the orb of white chocolate that when cracked gave way to a burst of apple gelee...that was genius. It wasn't the best dessert I've ever tasted flavor-wise but it was certainly pushing boundaries and giving me something I've never had. Equally stellar was the salted caramel custard served in an eggshell a bit of lagniappe that surpassed most of the meal in quality.Is Le Bernardin an outstanding restaurant? Absolutely. Did I enjoy myself immensely? Of course. Will I be returning anytime soon? Probably not because this price point is too high for a peasant like me...unless it's a life-changing meal. And this wasn't. But it was damn good."]
105.Aria Hell’s Kitchen,[u'After reading some of the other reviews I may agree that our experience at Aria\'s was a little rushed. Also agree wine was a bit warm but red wine usually isn\'t supposed to be in the refrigerator?! Our rose and white wines were cool and refreshing however. First our waiter came and wrote down a couple specials of the day directly on the menu as well as verbally telling us even more. There were so many specials he was telling us about and in combination with his French accent I couldn\'t even gather everything he was telling us. I started laughing because there were so many specials that day and I\'m sitting there like "How am I supposed to remember everything you\'re saying?!" But it all sounded good! I remember hearing gnocchi in that list and I\'m always on the lookout for some good gnocchi so will probably try that next time..Wine list is pretttyyyy extensive and our French waited was very knowledgable on recommending different types of wines asking just how "bodied" you would what your red wine to be. When we went we were told we had to order food and couldn\'t just order wine. We shared a mushroom bruschetta with truffle and it was delicious! A very interesting take on the bruschetta at least ones I\'ve had before as this had a heaping amount of melted cheese on top but IM NOT COMPLAINING!They offer wines in different sizes I can\'t remember how he labeled the sizes but the smaller size comes in a plain cup not your standard wine glass. The interior is very cute earthy homey. Prices are also surprisingly affordable somehow I thought it\'d be more on the pricier side. If I had only been craving Italian food that day!... Oh well next time.' u"This place only gets two stars because I used to bill it as my favorite spot to eat in midtown west. It's gone so badly downhill that I cannot in good conscience recommend it at all. This place used to be a sweet wine bar with tasty tapas. However last night we went after an event in Times Square and it was a huge disappointment! We ordered the sardines pork ribs and a cavatelli with sausage and each and every item was terrible.The sardines were served with mushy Lukewarm polenta and filled with some sort of tasteless mushy nonsense. The after tasted haunted me for hours afterwards and I barely managed two bites. The pork ribs were chewy and tough covered in a generic barbecue sauce and served with what could barely pass as cooked potatoes. The cavatelli tasted like watery chef Boyardi. I can only hope that this experience was a fluke but I can't say I'm in a rush to go back and find out." u'Great food; good drinks; really slow service (food came fairly quickly but took forever to get the menus). I had the shrimp rigatoni which was wonderful especially the sauce! We also tried the meatballs (very tasty but not out of this world) grilled octopus crostini (now this was more special - all the flavors came together amazingly) and brussels sprouts (interesting - a bit sweet and drizzled with honey though not my personal favorite). Overall enjoyable experience.' u"Aria and its sister restaurant Briciola directly across the street specialize in super affordable pasta dishes and Italian tapas. I've already reviewed Briciola and also the other Aria location down in the West Village so in terms of the food its all identical. But the ambience is not LOL!!I have to say I really loved the particular atmosphere this location has. Everyone from the hostess to the waiters were friendly and courteous. Briciola on the other hand was very small and cramped and the downtown Aria location was nowhere near as lively and energetic as this one here in Hell's Kitchen. I was starving so this time I ordered 3 YES 3 different pasta dishes. I started off with the Pappardelle. It was simmered in a boar ragu sauce soooooo meaty!! Next up was Linguine Vongole. Here they do it with a twist.......its still a white clam sauce with garlic and olive oil but they add fresh chopped tomatoes to it. Note it did not change it to a red clam sauce but it added a different tartness to the dish. And last but not least I ordered the Orecchiette di Puglia. The little ears of pasta were perfectly tossed with garlic and olive oil with generous meaty chunks of sausage and broccoli rabe. I asked my waiter what lovely desserts they offered. The special dessert of the night was the Tiramisu and I took him up on his recommendation. It was soooo creamy and rich with just the slight hint of rum. Everything was soo wonderful that I left a very big tip. A+ all around!" u'Came here for the bar just before dinner so i omly had an octopus appetizer but it was so good!' u"Enjoyed my experience here. I popped in on the way to a show and the aesthetic is reminiscent of a French bistro but not in a cheesy way. I had a couple of pints of Peroni and the gnocchi. I sat at the bar and just trolled through twitter and enjoyed my lite meal before the show. It was a Thursday night early so not too crowded at all. I know there have been loads of negative reviews re: the dreaded man with the pony tail. I did not see him but I kept a keen eye out as he sounds like some sort of Hells Kitchen style culinary terrorist. I'll be back again as the bar keep was kind and not too pushy although they definitely have a burn and turn vibe. There aren't that many half-decent spots in the neighborhood so I would say give it a shot. All and all a pleasant experience." u'Worst and rudest host named "Alex" went there for a date and we left because of his disrespectful attitude.' u"This might have been one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. The service was absolutely atrocious the food was ok but the people who work there might be the rudest i've ever encountered at a restaurant in nyc. My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant hoping to have a nice dinner after the waitress ignored us during our entire meal the check came. She made sure to tell us that service was not included in the bill. We tipped 15% which is a standard in NYC and we were chased out of the restaurant with insults. She yelled at us for tipping the standard...? She didn't deserve a tip at all. What an awful dinner and an unfortunate experience to have had. do not go." u"The ambiance here is perfect for date night candle lit tables for 2. The wine selection is vast all Italian and all delicious. The food is so delicious you cannot go wrong! Pasta dishes are all $12! That's a good deal especially for the quality! Salads are $10 as well as appetizers.The espresso is amazing! Straight from Italy you'll think you've left NY for a brief moment! The tiramisu is a must for dessert!" u"Went here for an early dinner at 6pm. Restaurant was almost completely empty. As a previous review states wait staff hovered around our table constantly asking repeatedly if we were done with our food. Ordered 2 pasta dishes - portions are small and spaghetti overcooked in both. Ordered a bottle of Rose which was good but extremely overpriced at $70. Checked online and found it retails for $18!!! \xa0I don't mind paying a markup but almost 300% is ridiculous. Overall expensiverushed bad service." u"This place has such potential but really falls short. The menu looks fantastic but everything is a la carte so it ends up being really expensive. There are no side salads/dinner salads. The only salads are slightly larger and $12. I'm not spending $12 on a salad.The decor is fantastic which is what brought us in the door. But our waiter was lousy--and it was obvious because the owner/manager kept reminding him about things (like coming to our table when we waved him over). He also had dirty fingernails which is gross. My wine was sub-par not even close to what I'd ordered. I told the waiter this and he told me the wine was fine. I pushed further and he brought that bottle of wine to the table to assure me it was the right wine. I pushed he brought me different wine. Really that's not how good service goes. My meal was excellent (Arugula salad Gnocci Creme Brul\xe9--which could have been warmer but still delish). But truly I wouldn't go back. I can't spent $45 for this meal it's just too much." u'I was looking for a place to have lunch and a friend of mine gave me the address for Aria and although i had been in this area many times I could not place where it would be located. The space used to be a South African wine bar. I sat down for brunch and perused the menu. Their brunch options were priced at $14 each. i ended up getting a pannini sandwich with prosciutto and kale pesto mozzarella \xa0and tomatoes. I also got a cup of coffee to tide me over and I was asked if I wanted to have some bread with EVOO-[of course!!] It was fresh and delicious. The pannini sandwich arrived and it was hot and delicious. The staff was very accommodating-the space is the same size as \xa0its previous inhabitant. i would recommend and return' u"Love that this place is right by my office. \xa0Unique flavorful small plates and a nice wine list. \xa0It's crowded every night of the week. \xa0Most of all price point for this area of town - Wine and dinner for less than $50 on any given night." u'Where is the disgust emoji when you need one so badly?For years I was in love with the West Village spot so I got really ecstatic when this place opened a few blocks up from my friend\'s place. A sucker for their cheap wine yummy small plates and intimate dark dining room I thought I would be a frequent visitor. But sure enough this was the most disastrous dinner I have ever had in New York.Just after we ordered a pack of staff started hovering over our shoulders - runners barmen the hostess. The second my boyfriend put his fork down his apt plate was gone - not even a question if he has finished. Not once not twice but three times they tried to do the same to me with food still on my plate me trying to protect it diligently. Same story at the table next to ours - a pleasant date was interrupted constantly until the guy finally had to tell them he will let them know when he is done eating. On his last descent onto our table the barman dropped a spoon full of pasta sauce on my lap. No apology nothing - he just rushed away. As I was trying to clean it up with soda water he reappeared with an odd smile - "darling this is a perfect occasion to get some shopping done." WTF?! Are you for real?! I was speechless. Everyone\'s attitude was so casual - many staff members saw what happened - as if it is not a big deal and I should not make a fuss about it. He came by just one more time two minutes later - to drop the check - the apology still not making an appearance. Pretty costly 30 minutes of a rushed meal + ruined jeans. \xa0You cannot pay me to go back to that place.' u'Very cute bar/restaurant but seating is really tight and bathroom is extremely small. \xa0Atmosphere is very quite and intimate yet surprisingly loud for how small the restaurant is. \xa0Drinks are good average prices for NYC food is ok nothing specials. \xa0I do like how the dishes are tapas style though so everyone can share. \xa0This is the perfect place to pop in for an hour after work before you meet up with friends. \xa0Not ideal for a sit down dinner and gabbing which was what I was hoping to accomplish. \xa0Overall I had a good time but I would only stop by for a few drinks next time food I can pass on.' u"Cute interior decor horrible service. I might be an exception because I'm gluten free but I don't think that means I have to sacrifice taste! Got the gluten free penne with the mushroom truffle pasta dish and it tasted like a Lean Cuisine. Also our waiter spent more time looking in the mirror at himself than paying attention to us when he was servicing us. Oy the struggles of a starving model/waiter. He totally forgot about us until we mentioned to the owner that we needed to eat and scidaddle to catch a Broadway show. Totally missed the mark sorry Aria." u"I'm a big fan of Aria I love their location on Perry Street. The atmosphere is awesome the food is AMAZING and the service is always good. I know the Perry Street location is constantly crowded. Today I came around noon and it wasn't crowded at all but I have to imagine it does for dinner. Be prepared to wait (but its so worth it). Today I had the mushroom flat bread the eggplant/goat cheese roll and a shrimp & artichoke skewer to share with my mom. They were ALL delicious. Every single plate tasted amazing. If you are a fan of the Perry Street Aria you'll be a fan of this one. If you've never tried Aria try it. Either location same deliciousness." u'The environment the people the service and off course the food makes the experience unique! My wife and I were in NY for the design week and we were just walking around looking for a cool laid back restaurant to have a good dinner. We are super happy we found Aria! The food has a unique touch super clean and fresh flavors make every dish we extremely happy satisfied and wanting for more. Some of the highlights were the tagliatelle bolognese and the osso buco pasta ( no clue the name of the pasta). This place for sure got a place in our hearts/bellies anytime we come to NYC.' u"This place was wonderful. The bartender offered suggestions for both wines and small plates. Everything was delicious. \xa0There are a couple wine bars in the area and many are tiny. This one is also small but there are separate tables so you don't feel as if you are on top of each other. We were actually headed to Bricola across the street but it was so tiny we just couldn't imagine being comfortable. Aria was just right. *We did see the man with pony tail mentioned in other reviews and he was obnoxious - yelling on the phone etc but he left us alone." u'Highlights:Kale Salad -- Tangy perfectly cooked kaleCaesar Salad -- Creamy classic yet not boring Orechiette pasta with Italian Sausage -- Flavorful yet portion a little too smallChocolate Souffle -- BEST Chocolate Souffle ever -- decadent warm chocolate paired with vanilla ice cream *foodgasm*Cute interior not too divey dimly lit but can be a little loud for a group setting (especially during dinner)Attentive serviceWould like to come back!']
100.Ajisai Japanese Restaurant,[u"** NICE NEIGHBORHOOD JAPANESE PLACE **I lived in Hell's Kitchen when this place opened and I used to order from them all the time - so much so that they would often greet me by name on the phone! I've eaten in the restaurant plenty of times too as recently as last week and I have never had a bad meal here. Granted I am vegan so the things I get may be easy but it is always good. My standards are the cucumber/avocado rolls sweet potato rolls age dashi tofu tofu veggie soup green salad and miso soup. I always ask for more salad dressing to dip my rolls in and they always accommodate. I've brought many people here (including my mom) and always had a nice experience in fact I usually stop in when I am in the neighborhood." u"Ajisai is a middle-of-the-road sushi place on 9th. \xa0Not the best in Hell's Kitchen also definitely not the worst. \xa0They're ok.I've been a couple times and nothing stands out in general. \xa0The food is mostly pretty tasty but not outstanding. \xa0I know I sound like Captain Neutral of the Bland Brigade but that's my review. \xa0Mostly just uneventful competence here." u'Dine in is far superior to its seamless counterpart not sure why! Came here for lunch on a Saturday and was pleased that they still have lunch specials on the weekend. I got a salmon sushi set and the fish was very fresh and the meal was filling.Service is decent and atmosphere is very relaxed / casual.' u'Overall a decent Japanese restaurant. They have a wide variety of sushi and appetizers. Good place to go if you and your friends are craving diff Japanese foods. We got seated immediately (it was kinda scary how efficient they were) and service was great. Food came really fast as well. Interior decor was really cute too!' u"We dropped by this Japanese restaurant for a light dinner before catching a movie in Times Square. \xa0Honey plum sake -- \xa0tastes worse than cough syrup. \xa0It was way too thick and sweet. \xa0Smiley pork buns -- pork was not tender or juicy. \xa0The buns were soft and warm the same buns used for duck sandwiches. \xa0Sauce was good.Sushi rolls -- pretty standard rolls similar quality to the ones you get for lunch specials around the cityOverpriced for the quality but it's Times Square." u"The food was good even though pricey. Would recommend the chicken tempura. Don't have enough table space for groups bigger than 4." u"Love the food here but be warned if you don't specify lunch they will serve you the dinner portion just to try to get a few more dollars. Even if it's lunch time. Perfectly polite and great service but the bill was about twice what I expected." u'This is hands down my favorite sushi place! They have a great lunch special that I try to take advantage of. Highly recommend for a cute date spot as well.' u"Made a pick up order on Wednesday night and it was ready in 30 minutes. Friendly Chinese speaking staff. Got the salmon avocado ($5.50) and Tomo roll ($16). Regular rolls are priced reasonably compared to other places in the area but I think maybe the specialty rolls are a bit expensive. The rolls were well made and rice not too cold or mushy.Not sure if I would recommend the $6 gyoza since they were the SMALLEST gyozas I've ever seen.. and they only give you 6. Tasty. But so so small.The crunchy spicy salmon roll I got was smaller compared to the typical sushi takeout for sure.Overall definitely pretty fresh sushi and would come here again for my fix.TIP: Order online for a 15% off your first order" u'Ordered via seamless and the service was quick. Tried the Salmon Avocado Roll Philadelphia Roll and Peanut Avocado Roll. All of them were really good and were up to the NY Sushi standards! This can definitely be our next favorite Sushi place in our area.' u'This Chinese-operated Americanized Japanese dining experience is better than the other Chinese-operated Americanized Japanese dining experiences on 9th Ave. Where else can you get a Lady Gaga Roll with your General Tso\'s Chicken?Actually we stuck to their raw fish this time. The Sushi and Sashimi For 2 was very fresh and filling. The sushi chefs plated beautifully! The medium size cuts were perfect. The sushi rice was a good sticky and passed the "don\'t fall apart before getting to my mouth test."California and Spicy Tuna Rolls were included but a bit small. The crab and fish were less than generous. I didn\'t find the spicy tuna spicy but the roll had lots of tobiku.Service was efficient and maybe a bit too hurried. With the fish this fresh and of high quality I\'ll come back again real soon. I don\'t care who operates the place.' u"This place is either a hit or miss. I ordered like 5 time for the lunch special 2 rolls soup and salad for $10.50. \xa0It a great deal when the sushi is fresh. \xa0The second time I ordered i \xa0it was not fresh at all but my coworkers and I gave it another chance. It was good the next couple of time. Then we order it this pass Friday 7/22/16 And the spicy \xa0tuna was inedible. We called them and they didn't want to here it they were very rude on the phone and really didn't care about their product. Fool me once shame or you fool me twice shame on me. I will not order from them again." u'My wife and I are big fans of the lunch special and it is available on the weekends. The curry salmon is delicious. The staff is not particularly friendly but they are accommodating with modifications; for example you can substitute brown rice.' u"If competing with other Japanese cuisines in Manhattan this place is an average player. I was quite impressed with the decoration of their sashimi set. Sashimi is put on a bowl of glowing ice quite eye-catching but you can tell by the look that this is not where to expect an authentic experience. At least the food isn't bad in anyway and the place is not very crowded. Overall it's an OK place but don't expect more than that." u"Came here for dinner ordered sushi combo C and grilled squid.First for the service: I noticed that a lot of people complained about the incompetency of servers at this place. But our server girl was very nice. She gave us honest suggestions on the portions of food attentively refilled our water and offered dessert menu when we were about to finish. The only downside is that it took about 20 minutes for my sushi to arrive. Given that it was around 9:30PM and only few customers were there their kitchen is not really efficient. Then for the food: grilled whole squid lightly covered in butter was good. The squid was tender with a hint of smoke/burnt taste. Would recommend it. However the sushi was disappointing. Crunchy spicy salmon roll was bland the fish tasted like wired mushy dips the tempura inside didn't add up the flavor and the rice lacked proper seasoning. Tuna roll was just bad. Fish didn't taste fresh." u'The BEST sushi I ever had. Excellent price in the heart of Mahanttan. Will definitely come back.' u'I have to say service was just the worst ...1) I came into the restaurant a bit past 8:30 on a Friday night. Decided to get a table while my date was on his way here. Immediately gets seated in the front which is great! However no one likes to be in the front where people are entering and leaving. So there were two booths in front of the sushi masters and I requested if I can sit there instead. She said no because they\'re only for 4 people or more .. Ok. Weird because there\'s already a couple sitting in one of the 3 booths there. I didn\'t say anything since any seat is better than no seat. We were at the restaurant for about an hour and a half and those booths that the lady said was meant for "2 people" got seated by two other couples one for each of the remaining booths. I need some type of explanation. 2) when my date arrived and we were ready to order there were so many waitresses walking past us not wanting to take our order - mind you we were sitting by the front right next to the register. So if people needed their checks they have to pass by us. Not to mention it\'s also a small restaurant so they really have nowhere to go. Before my date arrived a woman asked if I wanted to order when she saw another menu across me... Like what? Finally a man came and took our order. 3) appetizer glasses of water and our miso soup came probably within 5 minutes. Which I thought was great! Hence an additional star.4) now reason why we were at that restaurant for an hour and a half.... Because our food took a good 1/2 to get here! I only ordered a combo B & my date ordered Salmon Teriyaki... Maybe the salmon teriyaki would take longer but my order only contained sushi... I didn\'t understand where our food was. 5) as we were talking about where our food was... A woman came to our table and said "Kobe." We were very confused cause nobody ordered it.. \xa0So I told this waitress blondeish/orange hair "hi. We didn\'t order Kobe." She stared at me like I was crazy like yes m\'am you did order it. But a different waitress came and said in Chinese thinking I didn\'t know what they were saying "Kobe is at my table." So the other waitress have a sincere apology black rimmed glasses. The one with the blondeish hair she had such a huge attitude. Like oops My bad kind of attitude. She also had to check the computer to make sure we really didn\'t order it .. 6) I drank all my water and no one came to refill it until I brought it up to the waiter .. Like hello!? What were we chopped liver? Because once again we were at the very front so it\'d be very hard to even try to ignore us. All in all if you want better service go somewhere else. If you want pretty decent food. Stay. Though portions aren\'t that great.' u'Clean firm and delicious Japanese restaurant. Price is reasonable and food quality is good.' u"Appetizers shrimp shumai kalbi and miso black cod are very good. \xa0Ambiance good service good quality food every time I've gone here." u"Delicious high quality food for a great price. \xa0I had the pork Gyoza veggie tempera and mushroom soup. \xa0The mushroom soup was so good. \xa0Tons of delicious mushrooms. \xa0I can't speak too much on their sushi because I don't eat fish. \xa0However there's a large selection of all types of food to satisfy any person's cravings."]
78.Vynl,[u"Came here for brunch around 12PM on a Sunday and was told the wait would be 30-40 minutes for 3 people. In reality it was only about 10 minutes.Overall I'd say this place is pretty solid for breakfast. The coffee is good with free refills. My sister got chicken and waffles which were fine nothing special. She wasn't crazy about the spicy maple syrup. I got the breakfast bibimbap which was really interesting and a generous portion. The noise level inside was a little loud as long as you're ok with that (I just felt like I was shouting the whole time). Overall pretty good though!" u'Vynl\'s seating is a little crowded and the service is a little slower but the brunch is delicious especially the billionaire\'s bacon. I loved the chicken chiqueles I got and will definitely be back to try other dishes. The decor is really cute and a bit eclectic for "Asian-insipred" cuisine but that\'s definitely not what you should come here for anyway.This is not a place I think I would take my parents but a fun place to come to with friends.' u'Food quality- avg Food prices- way above avgDrinks-okService- *we set outside- only to discover that the waitress allowed another table of two come with their dogs that DIDN\'T STOP BARKING.*When I asked for a supervisor to complain about this- I was answered there is no supervisor. *When I complained about the dog I was told it\'s allowed- which is not true!* asked for mayo and didn\'t get it* asked for mustard and got it only after I asked again. *we ordered another round of drinks but only 1 came. The other was just forgotten until we ordered the check. *2 other tables outside complained about this dog hotel they opened but the server didn\'t seem to care and insisted "it\'s allowed".This is a prime example how NOT to run a restaurant /dog hotel/ dogstaurant in NYC. Gross!' u"Came here for brunch and had a much better experience than dinner. They have a good variety at brunch (eggs toast salads pancakes waffles breakfast burrito etc) at all reasonable prices ($12-$15) especially for the amount of food you get!They play top 40 music in the diner (think Katy Perry Taylor Swift Bruno Mars Lady Gaga etc) with TV screens above the bar so you can watch the music videos. We were entertained so it made our wait go by fast. I ordered the breakfast special or combo of the day and it was amazing. I was able to sample the huevos rancheros (and it came with avocado!) eggs hash browns french toast and chocolate pancakes. Sweet and Savory! My roommates ordered the Black Kale Salad and eggs benny and all equally delicious. The variety available at brunch is great!The restaurant is stuffy and the seats are crammed together but that's not unusual for NYC. We waited \xa020-30 minutes for a group of 3. Chairs and tables are very basic. Great brunch spot in Hells Kitchen!" u"This place is so FUN! This is not your laid back slow boring eatery. It is alive and exciting - you can watch music videos while you eat and enjoy the music inspired decor on the table and walls.Since this place opens at an awesome 9:30am for breakfast you have a lot of opportunity to get a great dish!The Chelsea Boy Special was huge! Since I am staying away from bread it was the perfect healthy choice which a combo of grilled chicken breast scrambled egg whites and saut\xe9ed spinach. This places gets food on the table fast and there is also nice outside sitting (but limited). Great Hell's Kitchen spot!" u"Bright and airy Vynl is an excellent choice on a warm spring day. The staff is warm and accommodating and I'm not even mad that they laughed at our predicament in trying to get a two-year-old to eat her waffles. Speaking of choices I'm afraid I punked out and didn't get the Elvis' Revenge a sandwich consisting of peanut butter billionaire's bacon banana tempura and honey. Banana tempura?! What is wrong with me. I hate myself. Which is probably why I tried to be healthy and order a salad but then I ruined that by getting a Cobb (not healthy) and blew it even more by making it a wrap so it came with their heavily fried and salted (read: delicious) chips. It was a great lunch but I still hate myself. And you. I'm sorry I didn't mean that. Let's go back and get the Elvis' Revenge together. You're buying though 'cause you owe me." u"I went here to grab a bite to eat with a friend for lunch on a Monday afternoon. It was a nice day outside so we decided to grab a table outside.For my meal I decided to go with the special of the day the turkey and goat cheese wrap with a side salad. While the wrap had some great ingredients within it they weren't really spread out in the wrap. One half had the pesto while the other one had most of the goat cheese. The couple of bites I had with all the flavors were very good but they were few and far between. Also I didn't really care for the side salad as it was a bit underdressed in my opinion.Overall the food was decent but was a bit pricey for lunch. In addition the service was friendly but not super attentive--maybe because we were outside." u'I normally don\'t write reviews for take-out but this was an exceptional experience. I had heard good things about this place so was passing by on a Sunday afternoon and decide to pick up dinner. I placed an order for the Seared Coriander Crusted Tuna and a side of green beans and took a seat. Per my receipt the order went in at 3:46 PM. I realize its not McDonald\'s I was anticipating a 10-15 minute wait like when I order take-out from similar restaurants. Around 4 PM a couple came and sat down at the bar. At 4:13 I thought to myself "wow it\'s almost been half an hour." I couldn\'t find the lady that originally placed my order so I just explained the situation to the nearest employee who said he would send someone to check on it. At 4:21 PM the couple that sat down at the bar got there food. At 4:25 PM my food came out. 39 minutes. Is that normal? Am I crazy? I guess if I wanted it out quicker I should have just ordered dine-in and then brought my own tupperware to put the food in. Stupid me. I was then told I placed my order at 4:03 PM (despite what my receipt said. You calling me a liar?) and that it would be out in "a few more minutes" no apology. The employee who took my order never apologized except finally when I mentioned it she just gave a flippant "sorry" with a look that said "get out of this restaurant." You would think that you would want to make paying customers feel welcome to return to restaurant. Or at the very least make sure all there employees are decent human beings (as an aside the first guy--not the lady who took my order--I asked about my food was very nice).I got home and the food was greasy. And no green beans. So they were both rude to me and stole 30 minutes of my life and my money. Never again.' u"I am addicted to this place. My coworker recommended that we order from here for lunch on a rainy afternoon and now it is my go-to restaurant when I can't leave the office. I absolutely love love love their Scrambled Egg Sandwich but this is only available on their brunch menu. For anything on their regular menu I would highly recommend their BLT which surprisingly tastes very similar. That with an order of Rustic Tomato Soup. I have been meaning to explore other options on their menu but these are the only ones I've tried and they have not been a disappointment." u'Food is good but expensive! I ordered granola with yogurt and fresh berries and is was very tasty but a extremely small portion! For a $13 granola I at least expect to feel full when I leave. The berries were no more than a handful. And a piece of gum under the table ruined my black jeans. The waiter suggested to use water and left.' u'it\'s a weird melding of flavors here at Vnyl - where else can you find sesame chicken chicken and waffles all day breakfast and more on one menu? more importantly where it\'s all actually done well? and something called Elvis\' Revenge which includes bacon bananas and peanut butter?!the disco fries with fontina cheese were good though the truffle oil can be a bit overpowering (file that under #firstworldproblems). though as a diner purist I somewhat object to calling them "disco fries" when there\'s no brown gravy in the dish...anyway the fries were crispy and I was happy with that. the sesame chicken was really good. definitely leagues above takeout Chinese. it wasn\'t greasy which I liked.small but solid beer list.I appreciate their twist on diner cuisine and would definitely return.' u"If the name Vynl is supposed to evoke images of a record shop I'd probably say it's accurate albeit a particularly dirty one. I was nursing a particularly bad hangover and the water glasses all tasted disgustingly like alcohol so it really did not help trying to hydrate with this kind of aftertaste in my mouth. The service was inattentive and the table next to us left after receiving no service for 15 minutes - they were ignored by any of the waitstaff that did serve other nearby tables. I had the breakfast combination with eggs chocolate pancakes and French toast with fruit. The eggs and toast were fine but the pancakes tasted like dirt. I think Vynl definitely can do well in some aspects (my boyfriend loved his frittata) but the negatives for me really outweighed the positives when it comes to looking back at this meal." u'Literally popped in here for no longer than a half hour for lunch with a friend. A cool retro vibe to this place with old vinyls used as decorations all over the walls. Nice staff and cool menu. I ordered the BLT and my fried ordered the chicken sandwich. The food came very quickly and it was delicious. The sandwich was very substantial and came with a large amount of smoky bacon chips. Very good value and will definitely return next time! Saw one or two people buy milkshakes which looked awesome so will have to return just for those! Definitely recommend!' u"So let me start with the bathroom. It just makes me so happy to see such cool art have my own music playing and a small doll model of Beyonce in the bathroom. Totally worth it in itself.I haven't been in a really long time and it looks like they totally redid the place. Or moved? It just is completely different than I remember it though the bathroom remained the same (!)All waiters were super friendly helpful and attentive. The cocktails have fun silly names--I had the Justin Cucumberland and it was delicious. The tables are beautifully designed to show musical artists' faces and behind the bar there are 3 TVs playing top 40 (and old top 40) music videos with the audio to accompany it. The disco fries were exactly as everyone builds them up to be. Get them.The pad thai was awesome (I had a few bites) and the salmon was a decent portion and really flavorful. We had to wait a few minutes for the table and there isn't a lot of waiting space but it really wasn't long. Certainly worth going back to. The only thing is it is super pricey so not the kind of place you can afford to go to on a regular basis." u'Wandered over to HK for a bite and wandered across Vnyl. Great atmosphere! Love the lights and decor...all vinyl related of course. The music videos playing in the background is awesome. Had the Kung Pao Shrimp Tacos. Delicious! Quick service and friendly service!!!! A definite recommendation!' u"Vynl is a Hell's Kitchen mainstay. \xa0Although it has opened and closed 3 other locations in the city and later moved next door to itself it is always busy and never lets you down. The menu is eclectic serving everything from Chicken Clubs to Pad Thai from Cobb Salad to Tuna Sliders from truffle mac to Fried Chicken and Waffles. \xa0While nothing is truly exceptional they don't aim to be the best meal you've ever had. \xa0On the contrary they are a fun neighborhood spot that's upscale always friendly and open late (until 11 AM on Sunday Monday and Tuesday until midnight on Wednesday and Thursday and until 1 AM Friday and Saturday). \xa0They have a full bar and a fairly expansive drink menu that includes frozen margarita concoctions - like the carlos santana which is similar to a sangria/margarita mix. If you've been to El Centro Therapy Barrage Hell's Kitchen (the restaurant next door) B-Side or BSquared then you know that you can't go wrong at any of Chow Down NYC's establishments." u'Love this place always on point with there food and they try their best to accommodate your party as quickly as possible.' u"They have Beyonc\xe9 in the women's bathroom!! \xa0Men's has Michael Jackson.And the brunch/service were great. Thanks Mark :) No Reservations but it moves quickly and has a bustling bar. Enjoy!" u'Solid brunch place came here with a friend on Sunday around 11:30 and were seated within 5 minutes. Beware though it is very popular so if you have a larger party it will likely mean a longer wait. I had the Eggs Benny ham and my friend had the breakfast burrito. I thought the eggs benny was really decent eggs cooked to the right consistency though a tad on the runny side. The side potatoes were fresh and just the right amount of fried.Think whats more impressive is the decor. Each of the tables features some kind of pop reference and the walls are decorated with vinyls. Even the menu is made from vinyl covers.' u"Great brunch spot in Hell's Kitchen fun atmosphere and cool design- tad small so you may have to wait.. But the service is good and I recommend the Elvis' Revenge (pictured)- talk about a heart stopper! Yum!"]
1.Dutch Freds,[u'I heard about this place from some of my colleagues they insisted we go see the Bartender Frankie. What an amazing time we had with him. His drinks were A M A Z I N G.Frankie showed us a great time. DUTCH FREDS is our new favorite spot with our new favorite bartender Frankie. And the food is great btw.' u'I would give the drinks at this place a 5 while the food was just mediocre. It is definitely a good place to visit for the well crafted fancy cocktails however the drinks were a little too expensive ($13) for me to be visiting this place again. I was a little disappointed that the list of cocktails only contained about 10 drinks. The cocktails I had (Willy Wonka and Finding Neverland) were strong and perfectly blended yet I can still taste the distinct flavors that were described. poutine fries - The fries were super crispy even at the end it did not get oily or soggy. I loved that the cheese was melted parmesan instead of the cheese curds. The gravy is also very light and thin it was not too overpowering but gave it the right flavor.brisket sliders- I did not like this at all from the bread to the brisket. The bread was too heavy for the brisket. The brisket itself was dry and the barbecue sauce on it was too sweet and overwhelming.' u"Friday night and trying to find a not-too-busy cocktail bar in the neighborhood. Dutch Fred's is relatively new and had plenty of seating for our group.Cocktails are priced at about any other popular bar. Ordered the Dutch Courage ($13) first per the waitress' recommendation. Strong flavor with a generous amount of gin lightly balanced with lemon juice and bitters. Quality sipping drink. Also ordered the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ($13) - a very strong drink that's masked by a flavorful puree.Ambiance of this spot is great for dates and the food menu looks interesting. Considering the wonderful service and all the above will probably be back." u"Great place to grab a drink but not sure I'd come back for dinner since it's still mostly heavy average (Ahi Tuna Eggplant Chips) to above average (Chicken Spring Rolls) bar food. Good option if you work in the area and want to avoid the tourists. Solid cocktail and beer list in Times Square." u"I had been wanting to try this place so when my friends suggested it I was excited to go! Came on a Friday night around 9pm and managed to get a table for 5 immediately. We didn't try the food just the drinks so I'll have to review the food another time. I got the Kinky Boots cocktail which was beautifully presented and packed a decent punch. Not as sweet as I would have expected but overall it was good. I also had something called a blackberry shot which was delicious. The server was very friendly and even made recommendations. It's a nice intimate place for a date or even just for a quieter evening with friends. I'd love to try the food but may go elsewhere for cocktails simply because of the high price tag. That being said they're not at all watered down so you do get your money's worth." u"Dutch Fred's is the perfect bar for an escape from the overcrowded overtouritsty restaurants and bars in the Time Square area. \xa0I came here with a small group of friends for some happy hour drinks and food and was blown away by the restaurant service food and drinks.The restaurant is beautifully decorated. Has a modern yet old-fashioned vibe a mixture of old pictures and great interior design from their lighting and the beautiful set up of the bar. There's both bar seating and table seating available which is great depending on the mood you are in. As for the service it was top notch. Our waitress Tracy was phenomenal! Super friendly and attentive in taking our multiple drink orders. The busboys regularly came by to clear dishes and refresh our water bottles. The food definitely satisfied tipsy munchies. My friends and I ordered the poutine to share and I tried the ahi tuna salad. The fries were plenty to share between 4 people. It was topped with melted cheese and gravy with a mountain of crisp fries underneath. Super filling and delicious. The ahi tuna was also plentiful and cooked really well. It had a great crust with beautiful red raw tuna in the middle. A great refreshing entr\xe9e. The star I would have to say were their cocktails. I tried multiple and each were different and tasty made with great care and mixology. The Kinky Boots was my favorite fragrant from the fresh lemon complementing perfectly with the St. Germain. I also tried the Hell is a Mild Climate which had a great kick from the jalapeno. Overall a really wonderful experience. Perfect for dates friend catch-ups and afterwork happy hours!" u'Had to try the new neighborhood bar out. Certainly geared towards the Broadway show crowd/tourists you\'ll be greeted by a warm staff and a "where are you from?" and when you respond with "I live in the neighborhood" they will be slightly surprised that you\'ve found your way into this spot. I sat at the bar with a friend around 5:30pm on a Saturday. There was ample seating at that time but quickly filled up by 7PM. The drink menu is really quite fun and our bartender Francisco had a lot of good suggestions to tweak each beverage to what you like or you can go completely off script. This is a cocktail bar after all and Dutch Freds is a place that wants you to enjoy your beverage and take in the ambiance. Under the same ownership as Tanner Smith\'s on 55th street you will notice a lot of resemblance between the d\xe9cor and the food menu. We tried the meatballs the pork buns and the nachos. None of the food options blew me away but I\'d perch up here again and try one of the flatbreads those looked great and came recommended by the bartender.' u"Been here twice in the past week. \xa0Cocktail game was strong! \xa0Sat at the bar one time and the bartenders were excellent. \xa0 Food is very good. \xa0Small plates don't seem that small! \xa0 Both times haven't been able to eat all the food that has arrived.Service the second time was friendly but very slow. \xa0However still had a great dinner with terrific drinks (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is my favorite) and food...the wings are huge! \xa0Cauliflower tacos were good too. \xa0Their take on poutine is not what you would find in Montreal but it's still good. \xa0But let's be honest fries cheese and gravy could never be bad!Very cool place great decor and terrific atmosphere. \xa0Get there early because it gets crowded!" u'Our bartender Frankie was amazing and had the best personality ever. \xa0He was very entertaining and gave us free shots and mixology cocktails! The food was bomb too...a must try are the poutine fries with a fried egg on top amazing !' u"Long bar table Good drinks Fantastic bartenders and Decent food options..I really like the atmosphere at this place. It's such a low key but chic place to be. I do think they have areas for improvement on the drink menu - they just don't sound very interesting or delicious.. They do turn out to be good but I wasn't interested in trying more than the two I got.." u"Great bar right next to time square. Normally people are snobs and won't go near time squares because it's too touristy... This bar wasn't on the main drag of time square but close enough that it's in walking distance to many nearby attractions or even hotels. We got a few cocktails such as:1.kinky boots- delicious and more on the sour side but very good!2. Freddy mule- decent but couldn't taste much of the ginger beerOverall it was a good bar and also good prices for being in New York!There infused tequila with pineapple and naked P is a must try!! No hard bites but a delicious kick at the end!" u'Love their drinks and friendly bartenders! I could drink the Kinky Boots all night long. Yummy eats too- chicken wings meatball lollipops pizza (ok) and cheese plate!' u"This place is okay.Cocktails aren't that unique as expected. It's just pretty common cocktails you can get anywhere.Food was not bad.My friends were wearing skirts and got tons of bug bites in this place... It was quite disturbing and also we don't feel it very clean.." u"When I read the reviews I was stunned I couldn't believe there was such a good place next to such a touristy area. I don't like touristy things although I happen to be one in NYC and staying in time square but I don't care for that. I like more unique places that really stand out to locals We had a great experience! They even accommodated my kids and the servers were amazingly sweet to them . The bartenders/ mixologist all seem happy to be there and the drinks are out of this world! I had a spicy drink and a celery and omg those were the best drinks and ever. My husband also enjoyed his drink and so did my friend! We had a few different items from the menu and they were really good tuna tacos flatbread and the brisket sliders. Love this place !" u"Had to try this place out heard so many good things about it I started with the Willy Wonka great after dinner drink toasted marshmallow & shaved dark chocolate Watching mixologists at work taking pride in every drink they do is the way it should be done try the pepperoni flatbread & shrimp tacos you won't be disappointed I'll definitely be back." u"We were very excited to try this place with our cousin when we saw the amazing reviews it received. The inside of this restaurant is cool modern with a perfect amount of bar tables and seats. Our waitress came over to our table and we immediately ordered drinks. Kinky Boots was a great choice but The Dutch Courage did not taste like it had much alcohol in it and I definitely did not catch a buzz. The food was good but not amazing. We order the pork tacos the pork buns and the buffalo chicken spring rolls. The big downer for me was the pork that had a lot of excess fat on it and totally turned me off of the pork which is why I ordered the chicken rolls. After our first drink and initial order of food another waitress came over and took my chicken spring rolls order and our second round. After that we did not see a waitress for a long time. We sat waiting at our table with empty glasses and waiting for our check for a solid 20 minutes before getting the waitress' attention. I definitely would not seek this place out again unless we were invited. Hopefully they can figure out the service aspect of this place but otherwise it was okay." u"Great beer selection attentive staff and excellent food. Would definitely come back again if I'm in the area looking for a place to eat.Reserve in advance as it packs up QUICK." u"Tough crowd here in NYC so I was determined to try this highly Yelp rated bar. Amazing ambiance and attention to detail. Just exquisite! The ahi tuna salad was perfection and it paired very well with the Guinness. Wow try this while it's hot!" u'By far the best cocktails we had in Manhattan. My husband had the Old Fashioned and to this day talks about it. We went to another 5 star restaurant later and it was not nearly as good. I had the kinky boots which was delicious. Dinner was great as well. Try the cauliflower tacos! My husband was all about them and I was uncertain but it may have been one of the best things we ate in NYC. We had the hummus plate as well which was just okay. But go for the cocktails!' u'Expensive but good. We both had cocktails and 4 tapas and it was $105. Everything was very good. Decor was very nice. They wallpapered the ceiling in the bathroom. Really enjoyed the beer cheese. Tuna salad was a bit over done. Waitress was a Brit and very nice.']
107.The Long Room,[u"The bar IS the Long Room but there is plenty of extra seating for diners towards the back of the space. Came here for an early dinner with a gift certificate which was not only honored but didn't change the way we were provided service. The waitress was very nice and attentive with us the entire time. We ordered half a dozen oysters and they were probably the FATTEST oysters I've had in a really long time and I didn't even know there was an oyster happy hour at the moment otherwise I would've easily done a dozen. I think they were $1 a piece but wasn't sure the times. Also had the Everything Ahi Crusted Tuna which is pretty much lightly cooked sashimi. I dont recommend this to anyone who is super hungover but I did try it and it was yummy you can share this with someone else. Short rib empanadas are highly recommended they come 2 in one order. For dinner I wanted to try something different apart from steak and fries or any sandwich so I went with the chicken with mushrooms and polenta. The chicken was juicy and the polenta was perfect for this meal alongside the mushrooms.Everything was DELICIOUS for food served in a bar I was pretty impressed and will definitely return." u"My wife and I went to The Long Room on Friday May 6 2016 as we were visiting NYC. We decided on this place based on the reviews on Yelp!. \xa0We were greeted by a young lady who seated us as we walked in the door. \xa0Our waitress I would give her name but that would have meant she would have to talked to us came to our table to get our drink order within a minute or two. She came back with our drinks in short time and then walked away. Still no form of communication from her. She came back a few minutes later with her pad in her hand so we knew it was time to order which we did. My wife not being too hungry ordered an appetizer for her meal and I ordered the baby back ribs. Her tuna appetizer was pretty good and my ribs were just o.k. \xa0They were warm not hot and the BBQ sauce was on the tangy side which if you like tangy then you'll enjoy the ribs. They were meaty and fall off the bone tender. Over all I would try other menu items before ordering the ribs again but I wouldn't rule out the ribs. Our waitress walked by our table at least 10 times while we were eating and not once and I mean NOT ONCE did she stop to ask how we were doing. She didn't even make eye contact with us. I had to flagged her down to order another beer and a second waitress came by to drop it off. She spoke to us more in this one interaction which lasted about four seconds then our waitress. When our waitress did finally speak once our plates had been removed from the table she asked if we were o.k. in a manner as if asking us that after we fell down a flight of stairs as opposed to just finishing up a meal. I would have given more stars if it wasn't for our waitress. \xa0The other staff members seemed nice and out going from the nano seconds we interacted with them. If you are still reading this leave or move sections if your waitress is a tall slim attractive young black woman if you wish to have any human interaction. \xa0She was the least personable person I have met in 30+ years." u"Nice little place. Cozy and friendlyMy friends and I went there last and it was so much fun for us. it could be boring to certain people if you don't make the best of it like we did.we sing along with the guy that was singing he dedicates a song to us and my friends even get up and dance even though it's not a dancing spot lolBest place to listen to live music if you not in the mood for the club or the crowded pub." u"This place has a really great vibe. I sat at the bar and had their pork Reuben with fries and a Left Hand Milk Stout. The Reuben was tasty but the meat was quite chewy and a bit stringy. I probably wouldn't order it again. I'd like to try some other menu items next time but the main reason I'd go is the atmosphere." u"Went to the Long Room for a quick lunch. I've been to the LR before and always have a pretty good experience. I kept it simple and had the chicken Caesar salad which was solid. I prefer anchovies on mine but thats not an option. Regardless the chicken was tender and the vegetables fresh and the dressing was applied well without the salad being bathed in dressing. Service was attentive and prompt...and both the drink and food order delivered quickly. Overall solid fare at a good price and with good service. I'll be back." u"Meh. \xa0Hubby and I came here one evening after dinner just to have a couple of drinks and we were greeted with the most blas\xe9 nonchalant attitude maybe ever. \xa0We got rum and cokes and cosmos and they were fine but we certainly didn't feel appreciated. \xa0I know it's a bar - or at least the reason for our visit anyway - but they could've at least made a tiny bit of effort." u"I could see this being an okay option if this is the type of place (VERY after work Wall Street) that would work best for your party and you reserve the back area with the leather plush seating. \xa0Service ranges from fine to friendly. \xa0Very nice decor though extremely cramped in all areas other than the one listed above (meaning everyone in our party even the most stick thin couldn't walk between our table and the next without literally rubbing up against multiple people).Music was quite loud. \xa0Not so loud that conversation with people right next to you was impossible. \xa0But loud enough that after only 45 minutes I left with ringing ears. \xa0And you had to yell from your gut to get the attention of someone at the other end of the table.The pour on the Long Island is child's play which makes me think the other drinks have to be equally weak (if you don't get a customer toasty with a drink that mixes five different types of hootch? \xa0You ain't trying to get customer's toasty). \xa0I have never been given this drink in such a dainty cup; no volume worth speaking of for this sticker price. \xa0For $14 even in this area I've always received more along with a nice little buzz. \xa0Nada here. \xa0So stick to beer.The food looked fine. \xa0No one complained though no one raved.On the plus side - and with props - they were fine letting everyone in a large party pay individually.If you like this kind of Brooks Brothers crowd give it a whirl. \xa0Otherwise no go. \xa0This is about as far from an Irish Pub as I've yet to experience." u'Lunch Wednesday July 20 2016Just sat at a table in the back with 2 colleagues. \xa0We were seated immediately (12.30pm). \xa02 salads (tuna/chicken) and a burger w/fires. \xa0All 3 meals were just fine and reasonable priced. \xa0Service was fine.Will be stopping back for a couple beers on the way out this evening.' u'Great place in Times Square area to grab a drink and catch a game. They have a really long bar which I assume has something to do with the name. The place definitely has a pub feel. Even has a wall of "many leather bound books."Lots of beers and a full bar. Even carried a Louisiana (local for me) Abita Mint Julip beer. While we were there an very very inebriated man came in and the Irish(?) bartender refused him service but offered him food so he is owed many kudos and respect for doing that and then keeping his calm through it all.' u"Time Squares shit show can wear thin on any good New Yorkers soul unless of course you're a tourist gawking and taking pics with one of the 650 spidermen or the painted naked ladies which happen to my personal favorite. Next time escape for a quick bite and a brew at the Long Room.$1 anytime oysters just off the craziness of time square yep bring it on. Yes $1 oysters baby. \xa0All the time hell that's reason alone for me to pop on in. Well there isn't a variety. Typically long islands finest fresh with plenty of cocktail with horseradish and crackers. I've been known to destroy a few dozen or so per sitting.A massive variety of craft beer selections and I mean massive. They're always quick to offer up samples which makes the decision a bit easier on the gullet because I despise beer crimes. Always cold and goes down oh so well while accompanying those briney slimy crustaceans.A gastropub that hits the spot every time. The rest of the menu is of your typical pub grub affordable and comforting. Me I come for the oysters and multiple brewbakers.Quick and attentive friendly service in a clean establishment even during crowded after work happy hours. I nice place to meet up with coworkers or friends while avoiding the tourist stampede to the chain type places just a block away.So the next time you find yourself feeling a bit claustrophobic from Time Square congestion head for a quickie at the Long Room." u"Not bad neat bar... Beautiful in the back room. Staff is a little cold and the drinks are inconsistent but for a quick drink and a bite to eat it's ok." u"Great atmosphere. Beautiful and comfortable decor reminiscent of a 1920s library. Decent prices. The cheese and meat plate was filling and a wide variety just beware it has nuts if you're allergic. Only thing that would make this place better would be if it had a happy hour!" u'When I first walked in I got the "middle-aged" bar feel. Probably because there was only middle-aged people around me. I immediately got a seat with my friend and the waitress service was right there to help us out! About a half an hour into our dinner a lot more people showed up of various ages. Thus it can be confirmed that this is not just a bar for middle-aged people as I perceived initially. The food is SO GOOD! My friend and I decided to make The Long Room a standard meeting place for our dinner/drinks! The bartender even walks around asking about people\'s drinks- which I thought was really thoughtful and it made the whole experience very pleasant and it was nice to put a face to a usually invisible person! I\'m definitely coming here again and so should you.' u"I had a work event here so I don't know anything about the pricing but it's definitely tailored more towards people who work in midtown. The food was surprisingly decent - I liked the edamame potstickers and the crab cakes. The service was really nice too very friendly although the bartender was less so.The drinks however were very watered down and not flavorful - maybe the worst I've had in nyc. I got a whiskey sour mojito gin & tonic and Long Island iced tea - only the whiskey sour at least had some flavor to it while the other drinks just tasted like variations of flavored water.Come here if you want a few bites to eat rather than to drink." u'Stopped by for an early dinner before an event. \xa0Nothing fancy just a burger and a draft beer.One of the better burgers which I have had in a while. \xa0Comes with good fries. \xa0Basic burger was inexpensive at $12.95 with extras an addition $1.00 or $2.00. So a bacon cheeseburger came to $15.95 \xa0A Smithwicks - 12 ounce pour - was $7.50. \xa0I forgot to count the taps but might be twelve. \xa0I recall two versions of Sam Adams Stella Brooklyn Lager Guinness Harp Smithwicks but that is not a complete list.Bartenders were friendly efficient. \xa0A few smaller flat screen tvs. \xa0Not a sports bar. \xa0Worth a try. \xa0I will go back.' u"After taking my girlfriend to see a show nearby we popped in here for drinks and were astounded at the bad service and even worse attitudes of the bartenders here. We were dressed well and in great moods until Clive came into our lives that evening.We didn't act like dumb tourists and were very polite yet treated with such disrespect and disdain as though we had just crawled out of a sewer or were disease ridden. We had one drink (which took forever to even get noticed) and got outta there quick before he was able to bring us down any lower than he already had with all his negativity and scowling. We will never be returning again and urge anyone who doesn't like being treated like dreck to do the same!" u'Went after a show on Friday. Not overly crowded good service and a solid selection of drafts.' u'Great place good prices for the area very friendly wait staff. And great food an drink!' u'Lively bar scene. But totally rude unwelcoming service. The waitress could not have been more arrogant and unhelpful (said "I don\'t have any vodka" in a tone that suggested we\'d asked for illegal drugs...) Will never go back (and frankly can\'t figure out why it\'s so crowded).' u'I used to be a regular here and then moved to another part of town and in my short absence things have changed dramatically. \xa0All the friendly people I remember and knew are no longer here or at least not a one on my Friday night visit last week. \xa0Instead there was a complete tool I\'ve never seen before named Clive and when I say the rudest and most off-putting "service" I\'ve seen in years that is an understatement of epic proportions.I won\'t go into all the details of his nasty behavior and attitude but I can say that I will never be going near this place again. \xa0I had to go home and shower immediately to get his massive cloud of douchebaggery off of me.P.S. \xa0The other folks working that night were also completely unhelpful and unfriendly as well. \xa0I never saw a single smile or happy face the entire time.']
52.Goggan,[u"The food is soooo good. We looooooved the Crevette Cru. The shrimp meat tastes so fresh and succulent. Make sure you eat and suck on the head which is even better than the body. Also comes with roe and uni. But ditch the rice portion which has a very strange taste.The Galbijjim is also highly recommended. The butternut puree pairs really well with the tender chunk of soy-glazed short rib. Veggies on the side needed work. Carrots were undercooked and pearl onions could have been more flavorful. Chestnut was cured in soy and treated as a savory component but I think it should have been sweet.Service was not the traditional friendly type but more lighthearted and playful. One hiccup was being served entrees before my friend finished starter (granted he was picking up fish roes one at a time using his chopsticks... I started checking my phone). But the whole evening was a delight thanks to the amazing food and ambience. My friend later texted me and thanked me for picking this spot.Final note is there's dining section that appears to be a private room with 2 and 4-tops. Who do I have to know to get to sit there?" u'KenScale: 8.5/10My mom has been in town for a while and I figured I should take her to a Korean restaurant at least once to see how the Korean food is doing in NYC. There has been a lot of promotional activities for Korean food sponsored by the previous Korean government and the profile of Korean food has certainly grown in America over time. It\'s just that Manhattan doesn\'t necessarily offer the greatest collection of Korean restaurants (even more so in K-Town where you don\'t have to have a great restaurant to be successful since there will always be a mob of Korean Chinese and other curious American crowds flooding the neighborhood). I do feel like Goggan is an exception. While on my previous visit I thought this was more of a New American restaurant disguised as a Korean one my return visit with my mom was just as pleasant as last time. While Goggan doesn\'t display the kind of flair that places like Jungsik in TriBeCa shows the consistent level of execution and clean flavor are the winning formula at this modern Korean restaurant nearby Times Square. The mushroom salad with kale and sesame dressing doesn\'t really look like "muchim" salad dish in Korea but nevertheless I had a lot to like about the nice balance of flavor. Seafood scallion pancake with shrimp oyster scallop and calamari also had richness to the flavor without being overly heavy and all the seafood worked together quite well. Grilled Flatiron steak with pickled moo scallion and ssamjang was prepared more or less perfect medium rare to display the meat\'s juicy tender texture and I really liked how the meat wasn\'t over-seasoned with salt and other condiments to potentially undermine the texture. The highlight of the night was the simple-looking bibimbap which has over time become a popular dish even among Americans after Korean BBQ. The assortment of beef carrot zucchini bean sprout spinach shiitake mushroom and egg was spot on and I absolutely loved how the texture of rice was just sticky enough to make sure all the ingredients came together at once. I am always a fan of a nice bibimbap dish and the one at Goggan was definitely a winner. After a satisfactory meal my mom and I ended with delightfully refreshing omija (five-flavor berry) sorbet.Getting a reservation at Goggan doesn\'t still seem too difficult although the restaurant was starting to fill up in the course of our meal. I tried the hwayo (premium soju) cocktail with yuja and tonic water and it had clean flavor to go along with the dishes. My mom lamented how it is hard to truly display the authentic Korean culinary experience in an American metropolis like New York but she saw a lot of promise from a modernized version that can appeal to broader audience in the country. I do feel Goggan has a lot of promise to make that happen and hope this place continues to draw more attention and thrives among extremely selective New York diners.' u"The restaurant wasn't busy on a Wednesday night. I was able to grab a seat at the chef's bar overlooking the kitchen.Ordered the Haemul Jjim (seafood stew) with lots of fish shrimp calamari mussels and clam! They asked how spicy do I want it to be and the dish came out the right level of spicy. Delicious! The waiter and hostess are super friendly and care about your experience here. Keep in mind that this is not a traditional Korean restaurant. There's no banchan but they serve an amuse appetizer ands sorbet after meal." u"Stopped by on my way home for a quick bite thinking it's a Korean restaurant. \xa0I was wrong! This is just a very expensive disguised stuff that has no resemblances to Korean food. \xa0No it's not fusion it's just wrong! \xa0I had $38 Galbujim which basically was a small piece of meat drenched with out-of-a-bottle BBQ sauce with small bits of roasted vegi bits. \xa0When waiter brought it out I thought it was an appetizer with small bit of meat but it turns out that was the dish! \xa0 \xa0Additionally they charge for rice and banchan which fundamentally violates the Korean meal experience! \xa0Do not go there if you expecting anything like a Korean food. \xa0Or if \xa0you are new to Korean food this will give you a twisted idea of Korean food. \xa0AVOID!!!!" u"If you want Korean food then don't come here. This place uses Korean food and smoosh it with French cuisine to create a new fusion type of food. It's definitely an interesting take on two very different cuisines. We experimented a beef medallion dish an uni bibimbap dish bone marrow and pork belly. The beef was really tender and flavorful (almost like pulled pork). The bibimbap was very interesting although I could barely taste the uni after it was mixed. I didn't enjoy the pork belly that much as it was a little dry and didn't like the apple bits with pork. We tried the green tea tiramisu for dessert and it was ok. The green tea flavor was very subtle. \xa0We also received a sorbet dessert sampler for free so that was nice. The chefs paid very close attention to the details of the dish so i have to applaud them for plating so well." u"Goggan does one thing really well: presentation. The food which is definitely meant to appeal to a Western palette unfortunately fell short of my expectations. If you're looking for a fulfilling Korean meal you might as well take the extra commute down to Ktown for something more promising. Complimentary diced salmon with sweet potato chip - In place of the complimentary small dishes that you usually get at Korean dishes we were given a mini cup of fish and chip instead. The dish was alright nothing very memorable. Steak Tartare - Tartare is always a hit or miss for me and in this case it was definitely a miss. The pieces of raw steak was heavily marinated so much so that I couldn't even taste the meat anymore. I'm usually scared that my tartare will taste too raw but in this case it was the complete opposite. Uni bibimbap - Very colorful and unique take on the classic dish. The rice was a bit hard thus made mixing the dish very tough. The taste of the seaweed was a bit overbearing so I couldn't really taste most of the other ingredients. The uni also completely disappeared upon mixing.Galbijjim - This is one piece of meat braised with various sauces and covered with lots of truffle oil. I really liked how tender the meat was and how well infused the flavors were! The portion is unfortunately super small for the high price. Overall I was impressed with the attentive service the beautiful plating and the classy cozy ambiance but I can't say the food is something I would crave. Better to spend your $50 elsewhere." u"The foods at Goggan used be a wonderful and tasty. And it was the most amazing Korean-French fusion restaurant in NYC. The old Chef(David) always used quality ingredients and achieved a balance that is really rare to taste in Korean food.HOWEVER the restaurant has been changed too much after their spring break (?) ... they re-opened the restaurant with new CHEF(A HUGE MISTAKE) new menu and new staffs. I can definitely tell that the changes were not a good idea for them. They completely lost their French fusion taste in Korean food which was very special about this place. The manager explained to us that the owner wanted to serve more authentic Korean food. Well.. Yes they only have authentic Korean foods in menu now.. Sadly the new dishes are not so good. In fact I can easily find so many better and cheaper places in K-town.We had dinner here about 10 times for our special days. But we probably wouldn't go here anymore. I am giving 2 star because staffs were nice as always.." u'I am always looking for new Korean places and I stumbled upon this one on Resto Row. \xa0I was a bit apprehensive at first since I typically do not enjoy fusion since it is neither here nor there and find it somewhat indecisive. \xa0Goggan has a warm welcoming decor. \xa0Kind of shabby chic which was fun. \xa0in terms of the dishes they had French twists on Korean classics. \xa0I enjoyed my preliminary experience but would like to return a second time to get a good sense for the menu.' u'Goggan which translates to "food storage" in Korean is a Korean fusion restaurant in the heart of Theater District. While you won\'t experience a typical Korean cuisine at Goggan the restaurant offers delicious fusion food meant to appease the Western appetite.My friend and I shared the Galbijjim and Sea Urchin Bibimbap. The Galbijjim is a long-cut short ribs braised with maison soy broth and served with pearl onions carrots beech mushrooms and chestnuts with butternut squash puree. The dish is served with a huge bone on top as a decoration. I loved the crispy dried jujube (date) as well as the sweet butternut squash puree. The meat was extremely tender but that also meant it was quite fatty. The portion is a bit on the smaller side especially considering the price.The Sea Urchin Bibimbap was a pretty unique dish made with organic quinoa and rice topped with sea urchin flying fish roe seaweed puree perilla kimchi chives and micro green. The dish is really pretty when presented but when you mix it up it doesn\'t look too delicious. But don\'t be fooled by how it looks! I was happy with the amount of sea urchin. However there was way too much sesame oil (and oil in general) so I didn\'t like how greasy and unhealthy it tasted.We ordered the Hotoek Fondue for dessert. It came with four halved hand rolled and pan-roasted sweet rice gnocchi served with red bean chocolate paste walnut cracked hazelnut cinnamon and brown sugar dipping. I wished it had more of the chewy glutinous dough because four slices were way too small. The chocolate dipping sauce tasted more like nutella and lacked the red bean flavor that I was craving.' u'I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I really couldn\'t. There were some dishes that were outstanding but some I wouldn\'t care to eat again. The prices are also outrageous for what it is. This is probably more of a 3.5 star review rather than 4 stars. Just a warning - I might sound a little cheap in this review but I swear when it\'s worth it I wouldn\'t mind splurging at all...but this really wasn\'t the case. Menu is also a bit all over the place in terms of cuisine (you see some french influences some mexican influences etc).We ordered a couple of popular dishes:*Meal started off with an amuse bouche - small serving of cauliflower soup. Super creamy but I thought the texture tasted a little gummy...kind of like when you over mix a mashed potato. Flavor was good though!Mushroom salad $17 (Grilled French baby horns hen of the woods ginger snaps fine herbs mustard greens with citron-pine nut vinaigrette)Really expensive salad...came on a really cute tree stump serving plate but it was just a small bunch of mixed mushrooms in the center surrounded by a ring of greens. It was really just an average salad - good but nothing special.Crevette Cru $26 (Fresh giant shrimp cured with maison soy sauce topped with fish roe sea urchin)This is the item that prompted my bf to want to come try this restaurant. Looks amazing in photos haha. It used to come with the black fish roe but ours came with the more common red fish roe. I thought that the raw giant shrimp was actually really good but it was only topped with a teeny single piece of sea urchin on each shrimp. Again very expensive not sure how this is worth $26."Goggan" Pork Belly $30 (Roasted doenjang marinated pork belly served with barley apple pickled jalapeno kimchi puree)This was DELICIOUS. I would order this again for $30. This pork belly came in a long strip - crispy on the outside and super moist and soft on the inside. YUMMMMMMMM. The kimchi puree was also something interesting that I\'ve never seen before complimented the pork belly really well. Apples and pickled jalapeno also helped cut the fattyness of the dish. THUMBS UP.Sea Urchin Bibimbap $28 (Organic quinoa and rice topped with sea urchin flying fish roe seaweed puree perilla kimchi chives and micro green)Another lackluster dish. This is what I wanted to come to the restaurant for!!! When it arrived it looked pretty amazing and there seemed to be enough sea urchin and fish roe. They suggest that you mix it all together and eat it like a regular bibimbap but once you do that...all is lost. Literally everything gets lost in the abundance of rice and you don\'t see any sea urchin or roe anymore. I felt like I was just eating a pretty standard cold fried rice :( kinda sad...all for $28. Another dish I thought was totally overpriced/not worth it.Green Tea Cheesecake $11 (Homemade green tea cake served with a scoop of ice cream) AHHHHH A++++++. I would get this again in heartbeat. The cheesecake was creamy yet not heavy. The icecream it came with was red bean (I think) and wasn\'t overly sweet. There was also a sprinkle of ginger snaps which gave everything a nice crunch. The only complaint I have is once again the price. If I were to pay $11 for a dessert it better be a decent size! This piece of cheesecake was literally he smallest serving of cake I\'ve ever seen probably a third of a regular cake slice you usually see. Why???Service was A+; servers definitely knew what they were talking about and were super cordial/nice. They definitely seem like they were very well-trained like you would see in any fine dining establishment. Restaurant was also super cute with some modern rustic charm.If they worked with the pricing a bit more I feel like a lot more people would think "that food was excellent and wayyyy worth it!" and want to come back again and again!' u"Came here for dinner last week. Made a reservation but probably didn't need to. The restaurant was basically empty however the waiter wanted to seat us at a table in the middle right next to another party. Did not make any sense and requested a more secluded table. Food was okay nothing spectacular. If I wanted better Korean food I'll just find my way to ktown." u'Wow. I found AMAZING restaurant in N.YKorean and French food is my favorite food.Then Goggan was perfact !! Im falling in love with Goggan.i can feel Korea traditional house from Goggan interior. I like it ;)Im glad we can found on yelp. We ordered lots of food but we ate all !! 1.Crevette cru ( wow. So awsome)2.Seafood pancake \xa0(crispy lots of seafood)3.Mushrooms salad (i like wood plate)4.Short ribs (Amazing. Look so awesome & so tasty)5.Pork belly \xa0(my favorite part)6.Uni bibimbab (wow this is my style so yummy)7.Desert (we want to hodduk but no available next time will try !! )*kimchi was so cute and yum!! I love Goggan! \xa0I wish like this restaurant in Bay area.We had great time and great food.Good memories. .unforgettable!! We still often talk about Goggan. When im gonna in N.Y I will try another food in Goggan. Cant wait !Thank you so much Goggan ;)' u'Super Trendy Korean Fusion spot.The food was delicious albeit expensive and the only knock in this place is that we did not receive traditional Banchan. That is typical for Korean hospitality and was disappointed we did not get this. Highlights:Soy Garlic WingsSkirt steak with Kim Chi fried riceSeasoning for each dish was spot on!' u'This place is a gem!The decor feels very different than you\'re typical Korean restaurant. If I didn\'t know what kind of food they served I would have guessed it was a more rustic take on the French bistro.It\'s strikes the fine balance between authentic and modern by staying true to the traditional flavors but giving them a unique plating or pairing. I also love that everything tastes incredibly healthy. I know it\'s rare to say that about anything other than a straight up salad but this place doesn\'t make you feel guilty for indulging in comfort Korean food.We had the poisson cru bibimbap and the "Goggan" pork belly. The poisson cru bibimbap comes with a hefty portion of sashimi and vegetables and the entire dish all taste super fresh.And the pork belly was the largest portion of pork belly I\'d ever seen! The meat was perfectly tender and fatty but not greasy or oily and came with a nice side mixture of barley corn apple and arugula. If you want Korean food that\'s off the k-town strip and are down for a little modern flare definitely give this place a try.' u"Occasion: Casual Friday dinnerOrdering: Sea urchin BibimbapGalbi Medallion Review:Overall it was a great experience. It is very modern/chic korean food. But unlike other modern Korean places (such as Jungsik) Goggan's food feels very modern but also holds on to its Korean roots. The dishes I tried are quite innovative in themselves but you still feel the Korean authenticity in their essence.Sea urchin Bibimbap:Very smart use of uni and flying fish roe in a rice dish that is well balanced with traditional korean ingredients - kimchi seaweed Shiso leaves etc. Every bite came with a surprise :)Galbi Medallion:Medallion is a western concept but the Maison soy sauce keeps reminding you of its Korean roots. Server recommended medium instead of medium rare which made the medallions very juicy inside. The watercress salad on the side was a refreshing complement to the dish.I'll come back and try other items on the menu." u"After the slew of Instagram photos uploaded of Goggan's Uni (Sea Urchin) Bibimbap it became a mission for my girlfriends and me to try this aesthetically beautiful work of food art.It did not disappoint and was delicious (and made for a great Instagram photo). I'm sure all the other dishes are tasty as well but they are on the pricier side for standard Korean food so unless I'm coming back for the Uni Bibimbap I probably will head towards K-Town for my other Korean food cravings." u"Very good! \xa0Had no idea what to expect. Had reservations and they seated us immediately. Place wasn't pack but started to fill up during our time there. They started us off with potato chip and salmon tartare. It was delicious .... I would of liked more! \xa0We had the Galbi steak and Goggan ramen. Both very good. The steak was so tender and loved the Swiss chard served with it. The ramen was perfect for a cold night! \xa0The waiter asked a few times after I ordered if I liked spicy (I do) but because he asked more than once I started to wonder how spicy would it be? \xa0It wasn't even spicy .... I'd consider it flavorful. Overall great meal and service." u"Probably one of my favorite korean-french fusion place in nyc. the interior is so cute with a clean korean cafe kind of feel. the food was mouth watering and so perfect. we got the kimchi fried rice and the pork belly for the mains and the hodduk (hotoek) fondue for dessert. I think the pictures do the food justice. Each dish had all the components of traditional korean food but with an added extra that made it amazing. It's hard to describe you just gotta try for yourself. Its a bit on the pricier end but the portions are big. Would definitely recommend ordering a dish for each person and sharing." u"Very interesting Korean French restaurant. Cosy warm very casual atmosphere wonderful food presentation made from fresh ingredients that's always a plus. The dish proportion is not that big but enough to fill you up. I ordered the dishes they recommend and they are delish! Specially with the Old Fisherman Stew which is a seafood soup It is so rich in flavor but it is not so heavy which makes you want more. I am a big fan of soup and it doesn't taste any I tried before. Definitely recommend to try it. SY" u'This restaurant is owned and designed by a professor from the Fashion Institute of Technology who was very present and solicitous on the night we were there Gog-Gan offers a warm and creative setting in which to enjoy "nouvelle" South Korean dishes. Be sure to spend a few minutes looking at the use of thread spools and other artifacts as well as clever disguises and uses for industrial and building code must-haves so carefully arranged and integrated that you will miss them if you don\'t make a point of searching them out. The owner\'s touch is clearly everywhere.As with the creativity of the decor each dish was inviting unique and delicious. A kimchi Jeon (Korean pancake) was both creative and traditional with the right balance of crisp exterior chewy interior and laced with pork belly scallions and onions. It was large enough for two of us to share.My friend selected a daily fish offering for her main course it was beautiful and perfectly cooked and presented. \xa0I had the Bibimbap with tofu a dish I have enjoyed in other restaurants. The rice was appropriately "warm"; the vegetables and fried egg topping could have been a bit hotter. Still the flavors were as good as and probably better than any bibimbap I had previously eaten.Our shared dessert hotoek fondue was definitely "worth the calories." A word about the staff: I don\'t know whether they are genuinely nice and caring people. If not they sure put on a good act! The service was not just attentive but thoughtful and kind.I suspect Gog-Gan gets a bit noisy as it fills. We arrived when the restaurant opened--but it was filling fast by the time we left. Definitely make a reservation.']
143.Sangria 46,[u"I came across this restaurant through Yelp  at first glance this place doesn't look like much after a quick glance of the reviews I was convinced to give it a try.We did not have a reservation coming in we had no problems being seated. Sat towards the back close to the open doors  good seats since it was a nice day. Once seated we started with a pitcher of Red Sangria  good sangria nice taste large pitcher was just right for two. We decide to stick with appetizers they start u off with some bread & chips not bad chips are warn good with the salsa but best not to fill up on bread. First up we started with the Calamares good calamari interesting cucumber dipping sauce but not bad. Next the Croquetas de Yuca  spinach these were delicious comes with a great dipping sauce with a nice garlic taste.Chorizos al vino tinto  spicy chorizo small sausages good taste with some saut\xe9 onions not bad. Empanadas de pollo were very good also comes with the garlic dipping sauce  yumm that sauce adds nice extra flavor to anything. Finally the Gambas a la plancha  grilled shrimp in garlic & olive oil  good as well nice taste. As for the restaurant simply Spanish style decor service was good & prices are decent.This place was a good find  we enjoyed our meal." u"I came here with my friend who used to frequent this restaurant when he lived in the neighborhood. Despite being in that short span of blocks between the Theatre District and Hells Kitchen -- places that often get a bad rep for being overpriced tourist traps \xa0-- Sangria 46 was decidedly delicious. While the inside of the restaurant was dimly lit and quaint accompanied by muted live music we decided to sit in the spacious backyard area since it was still daylight and the weather was agreeable. We started with the clams casino ($10). Not a large portion but they were tasty. We then shared the Arroz Negro (calamari and shrimp saut\xe9ed with rice in olive oil & garlic blackened with squid) which was a huge portion loaded with large shrimp. This was a great deal for $22. My friend also ordered the Filete Sangria (grilled filet mignon topped with bacon & mozzarella cheese in a brandy sauce) which I got to taste. Wow this was everything I could want on a steak. It was a nice tender hunk of meat too cooked at the perfect temperature.We had just come from a happy hour so I didn't try any of the eight flavors of sangria but I will definitely try one in the future. You can check out the menu here: sangria46nyc.com/#!menu/\u2026" u"I was in the area and in the mood for tapas and sangria on Sunday early evening. I was seated in about 5 min. The place was not full so service was very good. There were mostly nice tourist families. The classic red sangria was very good. The tapas was just ok. Chorizo dish did not have much ..... chorizo but had a lot peppers. Crab meat puff pastry did not taste right. I am not sure if had some sort of herb or the crab meat was not fresh. The beef empanadas was the best dish. Recommend this.My rating is due to the inconsistent food taste. Some was very good and some not so great. With so many restaurants in the area I'll try different tapas restaurant next time." u'DELICIOUS. I went here in a group of four before the theater - we made reservations for 6pm and had a nice leisurely dinner before walking to an 8pm show a few streets over. If the weather is decent I\'d recommend sitting outside in their cute little courtyard. We ordered tapas - our waiter recommended "three or four per person" but we were full after 10 total plates. We ordered the lamb shank filet mignon balsamic chicken (great sauce but chicken was a bit dry inside) grilled asparagus tortilla espa\xf1ola beef and chicken empanadas chorizo dates wrapped in bacon jamon serrano and bread/chips/salsa for the table. Several of the dishes came with some roasted potatoes and/or vegetables on the side. Really good. Share a pitcher of their sangria (various flavors to choose from) if a few people from the table are ordering glasses - it\'s cheaper.' u'Best kept secret in Manhattan!!! Delish sangria and tapas and paella with langosta!!!The service is top notch! They gave us free chupito and manchiega cheese with mimbriello! Very friendly and super efficient and the price was ridiculous low...Wow wow!!!Just across our fab hotel RIU Plaza in theater district!!!' u'Horrible!!!!!! I took my cousin and her kids there for dinner two weeks ago on a Saturday night. I do NOT like this place at all. Firstly the restaurant is so dark and the air conditioner isn\'t working well. We were seated for 20 minutes before the server reached to the table and offered us water. We ordered a pitcher sangria and honestly I definitely had much better sangria before because it tasted water-down. We ordered the mussel appetizer it tasted nasty because it smelled very not fresh as soon as it reached the table we taste a piece or two then we had to send it back and exchanged the garlic shrimp. Ugh another disappointment because the shrimp was overcooked and hard to chew. We also ordered the baby squid on sizzling plate the baby squirt was fresh but really had no flavor is the salt too expensive? The seafood paella with lobster was a ripped off I asked for one order and add the lobster asked the waitress if that\'s enough for two people since we had other dishes. She said yes! When the bill came she charged us two orders of it also they didn\'t take off the mussels that we returned. She went to adjust the bill and with the manager and my question about the paella. Then the manager/the bartender came over explained the charge of the paella with very nasty tone saying "well you want enough for two people so it will be two orders". I told them obviously two orders was too much for us cuz we were only able to finish 1/3 of it since we ordered much other dishes too. He was very rude to us but at that point I just wanted to leave. So I paid the bill but what I didn\'t expect is that the waitress came to "remind" us to leave tips and the lowest is 15%. she said her manager asked to do so. I was very upset because I always leave 20% even if the food is bad as long as the service is good and they admit to their mistakes. But since this manager decided to "remind" me to do that I decided to leave just as he requested 15%!!!!! I am sorry for this place because the food is not outstanding and the service is horrible plus the atmosphere is so outdated. I don\'t recommend this place at all!' u"This place has awesome sangria!! (Obviousy right?) I got a mixed berry sangria with limoncello and cava amazing. My mom got the white peach sangria which was very sweet but good. The bartenders are friendly and they have a tapas menu! We'll be back and we'll get tapas too!" u'My cousin & I had dinner here on a Friday evening; we had dinner reservations & we were seated immediately when we arrived. We had the Sexy Sangria which was recommended by the bartender & we will also recommend it :) for dinner we ordered the salmon & seafood pallea to share. The food portions are enough for two people to share that we left food because we were so full. Our waiters were very nice & attentive. We will def we going back to this spot.' u"I once stayed in Spain for half a year and traveled to a few cities in southern Spain. So I pretty much have a good sense what nice tapas should be like. Then I went to Sangria 46 for dinner. For two of us we ordered three tapas and one main course. I also tried out their sangria since it includes this word in its name. All of the things we tried were more than great the services were very professional and the environment looked legit as well. Tapas: Chipirones Vegetales Salteados Pan con Tomate y JamonEntree: Chuletas de CorderoWe were impressed by all of them especially the baby lamp chops (Chuletas de Cordero) asparagus (Vegetales Salteados) and the Jamon. We also loved the chips and salsa. I personally liked their sangria as well.We'll definitely pay a few more visits in the future!" u"My friend and i went here for dinner a few fridays ago. We found this place on yelp and the menu had many vegetarian and gluten free options ( many restaurants dont offer much of both except maybe thai so that was a plus) Place was busy on a Friday because its on theater restaurant row. So tip if you want a table inside make a reservation. Weather was semi chilly but they had a nice backyard so we sat outside and were seated right away. Service was a little weird interrupted. Our server was friendly enough but we ordered several tapas as appetizers and as our main meal and there was a pretty big gap between when they were brought out. At one point he cleaned our area and asked if we wanted to see the desert menu before we even had our dinner portion!!! The dinner tapas were brought off about 10 to 15 mins apart and probably 1/2 an our after we had the appetizers so we were pretty full and not able to each much of the last bit of tapas which was a bummer. The eggplant appetizer is really good. Also the spanish potatoes with come with a garlic mayo and a bit of paprika. Price was very reasonable. We each had a drink and had a total of 6-7 tapas between the 2 of us and our bill was around 35 per person! I'd come back again" u"Fantastic service fantastic food fantastic sangria!Four of us visited Sangria 46 in Hell's Kitchen for dinner on Christmas night. We booked through OpenTable which was a necessity given how busy it was when we arrived. This place is full of character! We walked in and there was an immediate buzz of many conversations libations happy people and just a great vibe.We started with an XL pitcher of white sangria and then ordered several tapas options. They've got a really good vegetarian section on their menu but the carnivores also had many many options.My favorite menu item (and I ordered a second serving of it!) was the melted provolone! I mean who doesn't love melted cheese with herbs all over it served in a cast iron skillet?Our server was super helpful in making recommendations and the staff in general was very attentive.While we dined at many restaurants over the course of our 4 nights in NYC Sangria 46 was among the highlights!" u'Have been here several times. \xa0Never let us down. \xa0 Very good food and service!Had the skirt steak and it was great. \xa0Loved the Sangria:)' u"Best theater district restaurant.The raspberry lemoncello sangria is the best I've ever had.Buy a pitcher! It's so goodThe filet minon and coconut shrimp tapas are the best!" u'Mauricio the bartender kept us coming back for more! Friends and love in this place! All the way from Miami one love!' u'Truly disappointing experience. I\'m pretty sure the owners of this place called it Sangria 46 because the sangria is the only good thing on the menu. We got a medium mango sangria waitress said it is only about 4 glasses. It is probably closer to 7 or 8 glasses so we could\'ve gotten a small. We got a few tapas plates all of which were not very good.Asparagus- good but the bottom half were literally inedible. Guys- asparagus 101 you have to cut off the bottoms... Tortilla- I\'ve had much better. Too dryPollo balsamico (chef recommendation)- dry chicken that tasted like nothing except balsamic vinegar. Empanada with tuna (chef recommendation)- Having PTSD flashbacks about this. My partner said "it tastes like they opened a can of tuna and stuffed it in a pastry." Shudder.The servers were nice but inattentive. They took away our barely eaten food without asking if anything was wrong. Afterwards we sat waiting for someone to check on us for another 25 minutes so that we could ask for the check.Then we went straight across the street and got dollar pizza. So the night wasn\'t a total loss.' u"Great little hole in the wall spot-Theater District's best kept secret! The sangria was delicious the ingredients were fresh and he ambiance was great. Perfect for a bite pre or post Broadway show!" u'This is the most amazing place I have ever been to- as soon as you walk in you feel like family- every single person I encountered was so nice- the food and drinks are to die for' u'So I\'ve never done this before. I just tried to make a reservation for this evening for six 6. I was at first told yes they could accommodate us. The manager (or owner) yelled at the young lady who was assisting me. He then grabbed the phone and asked me what I needed. I mentioned his restaurant had been recommended by a food writer and that we wanted to dine this evening at 5:45pm. I mentioned it was a group of media.This gentleman proceeded to yell asking me: "if it was a group of media what good was that and what did it mean for him". He said: "you\'re wanting to come here and me host you for free?"I was blown away and stated "Sir it\'s simply a group of six who heard about your location wanting a reservation noting more".He said: "well I can\'t accommodate. Come back another day". He the hung up on me.Wow. Simply just wow.So I guess I won\'t get to enjoy the four dishes I was told are amazing there!Good luck!' u"A relative recommended Sangria46 to me on my recent trip to NYC. Excellent setting. Service was spectacular.The mango sangria was SO good. We ordered from the Tapas menu and we were not disappointed. I've not had any better chorizo! Excellent!" u'Sangria was watered-down. \xa0The food was okay. The place was hot and it looks like the AC was not working well.']
165.Carve,[u"Love the pizza. Unfortunately I can't get it here in Oregon! Please ship your white pie to me...Go here order a slice of white pie and enjoy your day in New York. \xa0Love Carve!" u'This place is super solid. I was running late on grabbing food before seeing Waitress and stopped by here to grab a salad. It was one of those buffet style places that weighs your salad and oh yeah that salad was tasty and filling. I got a bit too much to stuff down my throat in the ten minutes that I had before the show started but no matter - it was delicious.' u'We stopped here in search of a place to make your own salad. \xa0While the pizza and sandwiches may be worth the stop the make your own salad just did not do it for me. I will say the majority of the orders were pizza...' u'Great place to grab a late breakfast at reasonable prices. \xa0New Yorkers will find some local favorites like 2 eggs and cheese in a Kaiser roll. \xa0We tried the muffins and they were fresh and delicious. \xa0They have a greats assortment of pastries. \xa0They serve breakfast played all day and have at least 10 varieties of pizza baked and ready to go. \xa0(Although I prefer Patzeria on 46th for NY style pizza). \xa0They also make fresh sandwiches. \xa0I found this to be a delicious and reasonable alternative to the pricey garbage food found in Times Square.' u'Pizza is delicious here and a great spot for a late night snack!' u'Amazing service and food. They have a big variety of pizza sandwiches salads and desserts. Very clean and great environment. Would full heartedly recommend.' u"I loved this pizza it was just the thing you need after a night out ! We stopped by at 4 am to get a slice of pizza--it's a must go when your coming back from the bars! Just enough cheese good size and plenty of toppings to chose from !" u"I popped in here for some dessert on my way back from dinner.It's very conveniently located. Right by many hotels which makes it a great choice if you need a little snack or just want a quick bite to eat before a show or a day of galavanting across the city. It's open 24/7 which is awesome. It was around 8pm when I arrived and it was still very busy. Lots of people were eating pizza. It looked pretty good. There wasn't much seating available but that seems to be normal for cafes in NYC. I was on the hunt for some real New York cheesecake and luckily enough they had some! They had an Oreo one and then the classic. I decided to get a slice of both. The Oreo cheesecake was very sweet and nearly overpowered all of cheesecake goodness. I'd give it a B. Their classic cheesecake was spectacular! So creamy and not overwhelmingly sweet. One very small complaint I do have was that the cheesecake was room temperature. I tend to like mine chilled a bit.Stop by Carve. It's a pretty solid choice whether you're looking for pizza one of their unique sandwiches or some delicious cheesecake." u'Ate at the chicken bar Great place to stop for a bite before or after a play. I had a bun less burger with a baked potato. \xa0Good variety of healthy foods to choose from in addition to pizza and fries. My cheeseburger with a bottle of water and baked potato was $10 and change. The staff was very nice and accommodating. \xa0You order yourself and they call you when your order is ready. There are tables to eat at. \xa0Suggestion stay away from the bathrooms a bit dirty!' u'Brownie cheesecake was super dense and filling. Chicken noodle soup was yummy. They have espresso and smoothies in addition to their pizza subs and breakfast that might very well be served 24/7.' u"The pizza here is anything but special. Mediocrity at best used as a last minute choice for a late night bite on Christmas Day. I had one large slice whereas my husband had a couple of varieties of their take on pizza. I didn't like how thing the pizza was or lacking in flavor. My husband didn't really care either way because he was so hungry. One thing that does remain consistent with Crave is that it does have a huge variety of stuff. We sat at the table next to the check out counter and in front of the bottled drinks and man they had everything under the sun. They serve both Coke and Pepsi products Arizona drinks chocolate milk and various sizes of bottled water to name just a few. The menu is also as extensive serving both sandwiches and desserts in addition to the sad pizza I consumed.They offer only high top seating or standing room. The line was out the door for mainly to-go orders but we opted for dining in after being on our feet all day. This is a first come first serve basis with not a lot of room for customers to roam. Definitely more of a 'get in and get out' joint." u'Stayed at the Marriott around the corner and this was my go-to breakfast spot! Family who are locals also frequent here. Lox and bagel was delish with a generous portion of lox. Staff is very friendly and personable. Will definitely be back my next trip!' u"OK to be honest being from South Florida I don't consider myself a great judge of Pizza but here goes...Pizza was really good got a slice for late night arrival meal. \xa0Comfortable setting with interesting street view with a lot of people to watch walk by.Price was right place was central place was comfortable (in a bench/bar seat kinda way) staff was \xa0welcoming... what more could one ask.." u"I came here on several occasions due to it being soooo close to my work place and easy for me to grab and go whenever I come out of work late for my break. \xa0Each time that I am here the same slice of pizza has different pricing. \xa0It's more expensive compared to the previous time I visited. \xa0I have visited 3 times within the last 2 months. \xa0A $10 sandwich was barely warm (it's cheese still cold and hard instead of melted) and had barely any fillings. \xa0On top of that my pizza was cut in front of me and I was given the smallest piece and was charged $5 for a slice of cheese pizza. \xa0If I am going to pay that much for a sandwich or pizza it should be done right. \xa0The $1 cheese pizza in the deli has the same quality so why should I spend $5? \xa0 The employees could use some training in the manners dept too as well as treating customers fairly as well as providing quality service." u"This place is conveniently located 1 block off time sq. they are open 24/7 and perfect to fill that sugar crave. The staff is friendly and service is quick. \xa0There's another location just a block away on 45th street if they don't have what you want there check the other location on 45th. Between the two you're probably going to find what you need." u'Many things are overpriced and the employees are unfriendly but this place still seems to have decent business. My sister and I got the feta burger and spinach Stromboli. The burger was nothing special and Stromboli was average. I regret not getting a pizza slice because it was cheaper. A Naked juice was $5.' u"I'm tempted to go three stars here because it's just so generic-looking but the food is slightly better than average especially important in Midtown at 4am. The desserts were reasonable fresh-tasting and the pizza was edible and almost tasty. Good staff that'll mess with you if you're not paying attention but smiling more than you'd expect dealing with crowds of tourists during the day." u"If you re a tourist you'll enjoy the slice and I don't blame you for that conclusion. But once you discover other places around the city you ll realize that this place is mediocre. Don't go here.I had to catch my train from 42nd street and thought I d grab a quick slice. Big mistake. I don't know how other people have reviewed this place as a 4 or 5 star. Overpriced and the quality is similar to that of a grocery store pizza. If you re trying to grab a slice look elsewhere." u"Wow. Came in here because I was STARVING late-night walking back to the subway and I'm impressed. Rarely do I LOVE pizza places that I just randomly just walk into. I usually have to yelp them ahead of time-I would have been pleasantly surprised regardless but I needed nourishment and here did not disappoint.The prices for Manhattan are what you expect but for the price they deliver. Two slices of cheese pie and a drink later to get the craving satiated and the hunger pangs at 2:30 am gone. Then off to the subway I went. I would absolutely come back here again (and this time a tad more sober to truly appreciate the deliciousness) but sadly I don't live in the great state of New York. Luckily for me there are plenty of retired NY bakers in Florida." u"Stopped in here late at night on the way to the bus terminal up the street. I had a broccoli and cheese calzone - it was delicious! They didn't have too many meatless options. It was way too crowded inside you couldn't walk anywhere. But the employees remembered who they had taken orders from and whose food was ready so the amount of people didn't ruin that. I'll stop in again soon!"]
137.Osteria Al Doge,[u"I just had lunch here with my coworkers and it was so great. The lunch menu is the same as the dinner menu so there is a good variety and the portions are generous. I'm back at the office and I don't feel like I'm falling asleep (which so often happens after lunch out) so that's a definite plus. I had the pasta fagioli as an appetizer the lemon chicken for my entree and the tiramisu for dessert. All were absolutely delicious. Service was friendly and attentive but not in your face and the interior design feels very Tuscan and laid back yet still charming. My office is right around the corner and I cannot wait to come back!" u"Came here for a lunch with co-workers and had an absolutely fantastic experience. The place inside is quite nicely decorated and I love the centerpieces on the tables. The service is great and they were very accommodating for our large group. 1. The bread and olive oil - incredible!! Bread is my love bread is my life and this bread they served was so incredibly delicious paired with the fresh buttery and fragrant olive oil. They also brought out fresh olives which added a nice touch. 2. We ordered two appetizers the Burrata (stuffed mozzarella cheese) with prosciutto and the fried shrimp and calamari with tomato sauce. The shrimp & calamari were great fresh and the calamari was not obsessively chewy I also liked the warm tomato sauce. BUT the Burrata was the STAR of the table. Never ever have I had such a delicious ball of cheese - and paired with the fresh prosciutto crudo is an experience I wont soon forget. I could have ordered two of them and I would have been satisfied with that as my meal. 10 stars for the Burrata please never remove it from the menu!3. For my main course I ordered the Pappardelle Verdi Al Sugo D'agnello (spinach pappardelle pasta with lamb rosemary and black olives). The pasta itself was delicious and the lamb was tasty and not too gamey. But my only complaint is that there was barely any cheese/sauce on the pasta. I'm a sauce girl and I think this was just tossed in EVOO and some light cheese. I just kinda felt I was only eating noodles but still really really good fresh noodles.4. For dessert - they bring out a wide selection I shared the tiramisu with a friend and got an espresso. The tiramisu was incredible! \xa0The mascarpone was so light and fluffy the dessert was just sufficiently sweet and I loved the dark chocolate spiral it came with. Let me just say this dessert was better than Mi Madre's tiramisu (and that's saying A LOT). Overall a great restaurant I will be coming back! Fresh authentic food and great service! :) Next time I'll have the salmon raviolini!" u'It\'s all about the food. The bread apps entrees and desserts are all wonderful. Complex flavors in traditional Italian dishes. The pizzas are unique and the pastas are authentic. During my first visit my waiter was amazing - friendly attentive and helpful. My most recent visit however I had the opposite experience. The waitress was completely disinterested ignored us spent a lot of time at another table we went long periods of time without seeing her and had empty water glasses most of the meal. We didn\'t get the nice complementary candies that other tables got (and I had during my first visit). In addition I had issues with my reservation - when I called to make the time later (which was well outside a busy time) the woman who answered said "no problem!" but when we arrived the Host was annoyed with us and there was no record of the reservation. I have had a few experiences with the Host and he\'s not friendly or welcoming. He visited and talked to other tables but we were ignored. So food is 5 star service gets a 3 only because my first waiter was awesome. The ambiance is fun - feels like your Italian Grandma\'s kitchen tables and it\'s a good place for post theater dinner. Close to Times Square and Theater Row.' u"Fantastic! \xa0Traveling solo for work which is not my favorite way to enjoy dinner in New York but... anyway the staff and atmosphere was very welcoming and comfortable! \xa0 I was seated immediately at the bar. \xa0Bartender was welcoming and friendly. \xa0The whole place smells like Rosemary.... it's heavenly. Seriously.. this must be the best smelling restaurant I've ever been to! \xa0 I had wine delicious bread and a spicy olive oil to start. \xa0Went with one if several specials of the day - a risotto with scallops and asparagus. \xa0Delicious. \xa0 Its a very lovely restaurant with soft lighting. \xa0I am sure it's very romantic if you came here for a date. \xa0But I saw several larger groups and families also and everyone was enjoying themselves in a very casual and easygoing way. \xa0The staff was friendly not pretentious at all. \xa0Great reco from the hotel bellman. \xa0Check it out!!" u'Date of service: June 4 2015Meal: Dinner dine inAll Ratings out of 10:Quality of food: 8Food to Spend Value: 7Quality of Service: 8Overall Rating: 8I was meeting an old college roommate for dinner when I was in NYC and I asked him for Italian options in the Times Square / Theater District area. He loved Osteria Al Doge and suggested we meet there. The reviews looked pretty good as did the menu so I was excited to try it out.As a starter we split the Polipo al Carbone grilled baby octopus served with oven roasted cherry tomatoes black olives and greenery. The octopus was very tender and had a wonderful flavor and the accompaniments paired nicely with it. I also decided to order Pasta e Fagioli a soup consisting of cannelini beans and pasta with some vegetables and a light broth. It was decent but not amazing. I have definitely had better versions of the soup.For my main course I ordered the Paccheri all Aragosta which is Paccheri pasta served with a lobster ragu in a roasted garlic cherry tomato sauce. The presentation was quite nice with the large noodles stacked offset throughout the plate and the lobster ragu scattered around on top with the lobster tail shell on the side. Unfortunately the tail was just a shell as all the meat had been taken out already for the dish a bit anticlimactic. \xa0The entr\xe9e was quite tasty with the noodles being the perfect texture the lobster nice and tender and the sauce having a great flavor. I would have liked for the sauce to be a bit thicker and overall I felt the portion was a bit small but it was still a tasty meal.The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere perfect for a nice dinner. The service was quite good and attentive and the food was very tasty though I did feel like the portions were a bit on the small side. Overall though I felt like Osteria Al Doge was a great option for Italian food and I would be happy to recommend it to anyone.' u"The food wasn't that great and the service was less than average. \xa0This is NY they should do better." u"I had a 6 o'clock reservation before a play but when I arrived at 5:45 they were happy to seat us. I ordered the ravioli filled with roasted eggplant and goat cheese and my boyfriend ordered salmon ravioli. The food was delicious and came out so fast! The service was wonderful. Seating was nice too because we weren't cramped on top of other tables like in many other restaurants in the city. The only complaint for the night was it was so hot in there!!!! Another couple left because of the heat and when we asked the server about the air conditioning he apologized and explained that it was due to the old building. I would give them 5 stars if we weren't sweating through our entire meal!" u"The last time I was in NYC my friends and I relentlessly hunted for a restaurant that didn't have a long wait. Somehow we ended up in Times Square amidst the city lights starving after a long day and night. Luckily we turned a corner and found this fine dining establishment Osteria al Doge. This is a place with elegant settings that offers authentic Venetian cuisine. We started with Carpaccio Di Bietole E Caprinoi which was a red beet salad. For my entr\xe9e I ordered the Calamari Alla Griglia which was a calamari marinated with lemon and herbs. The food was incredible. We also received fresh bread and bread twists. The entr\xe9e prices ranged from $19-30 but the food was well worth it. The service was great too! Our waiter was even from Italy so it made for great conversation about places to visit and eat if we ever happened to be back in Italy. If you are into fine dining and are in the Times Square area Osteria al Doge is the place for you!" u'Standard Ossetia fare and decent prices for midtown NYCGood service even during a busy hour' u"Great choice for the area. I came here with colleagues for a quick (and I mean quick) lunch before heading off to other meetings. They know and cater to their clientele which at lunch time tend to be businessfolk (not tourists) from the multiple office towers in Times Square. The service was impeccable- everything came out very quickly and the waiters were polite but they understood we didn't have much time. Even the bread/olives/olive oil/salumi/cheese (all free apps before the meal) were brought out with alacrity.As for the food- I had the homemade spaghetti with mushroom and veal sauce. It was absolutely wonderful- just perfect for the day. The portion was big enough to satisfy my hunger but not too big as to have me napping in my office.The price is on the high side but that's par for the course for this area. It also has that old school white table clothed look but with a more business-like pseudo-casual ambiance. I probably wouldn't come here if I were looking for great Italian in the city but if I happened to be in Times Square this is a good option." u'Service could have been a little better although the place was packed and it was the pre-theater rush. \xa0 I had an excellent skate. \xa0Everyone else was very happy with their food.' u'This beautiful bar/restaurant is a hidden gem in the middle of Times Square where you are spoiled for choice. After having an amazing time at the musical "Hedwig" (my friend and me wanted to stay on that wave ..... And by going into this stunning Italian bar/restaurant we stayed on the amazing time wave.... !We sat at the bar and were served by a friendly ( Portuguese barman) we had quality Pino Grigio and an outstanding delicious salmon dish. Because the meal was so filling we skipped dessert but still we were served an assortment of sweets complimentary by the barman and management.Simply the staff couldn\'t be more welcoming \xa0and amazing. The ambience is elegant tasteful and intimate as it is not too spacious. It\'s a great spot for a date hanging out with a friend or small group. I really enjoyed my evening here being served delicious food and wine. I sooooo will come back here when am in the area or after watching a show in theatre land.' u'This place was great! \xa0I came here with a party of 8 and I can tell you service was excellent. \xa0In my experience when tables are larger than 6 the service is slow but not this experience.It was top notch service. \xa0The food was excellent as well. \xa0I can\'t tell you what the whole party of 8 ate because...well I didn\'t pay attention to everyone\'s dish too focused on mine and maybe and my friend next to me. \xa0I order the Spaghetti Vongole see my pictures. It was AMAZING plenty of clams perfectly seasoned perfect texture noodles and that SAUCE...if it wasn\'t a work dinner I\'d drink the leftover right out of the bowl. \xa0I did get to scoop up some sauce with bread from the table but not enough bread to finish the sauce. \xa0For starters (i\'m all over the place) I shared the Caeser salad with someone else. \xa0It was light on the dressing which I\'m happy with. \xa0Nothing too exciting about salads - just my overall opinion of salads. \xa0My friend entree was a ravioli stuffed with salmon it was whole chunks of salmon which is great. \xa0She loved it and could not stop raving about it and let me have a taste and I agreed with her.For dessert we ordered 1 of everything and shared. \xa0My personal favorites were the apple tart with cinnimom ice cream chocolate moose cake and flan. \xa0The lemon tart I felt too "lemony" however there was someone in the group that loved it.I had a such a great experience at this place. \xa0I"ll most likely come back the next time I\'m in NY.' u'Elegant Italian restaurant in Theater District close to Times Square. Branzino Italian sea bass filet with Manila clams is lightly seasoned with fresh ingredients. Citrus mash potatoes add a nice zing to subtle flavor though room for stronger teasing of taste buds. If this is server top recommendation for pesci and carni plate then suggest to go for homemade pasta which should be comparatively better.' u"Had dinner here before seeing a show. Awesome atmosphere great service and amazing food! Server was very attentive and friendly. Started with the fritto misto which was delicious. For my entree I had the stinco di agnello which was fantastic. Most tender lamb I've ever had.We made a reservation a while in advance which I would recommend since it got pretty busy before all of the 7 o'clock shows.Overall one of the best restaurants I've been to in NYC! Great atmosphere staff location and food." u"Right off the hustle and bustle of Times Square. My husband and j popped in for brunch. We were able to get a seat right at the window so we could people watch. The place filled quickly! I overheard the hostess saying they're booked until 8pm so it's important to call ahead for dinner reservations! At least 1 day in advance!I had the eggs Benedict. It came with home fries. It was delicious. My husband had the mushroom pizza and he loved it. Friendly service. Very pretty place. If k lived here I would come here a lot." u'Extremely disappointing for the price. We paid 80 dollars for bland unseasoned veal and pasta topped with rotten shellfish (!) We were really looking forward to having a nice meal before our Broadway show and the place looked really cute but the food put a damper on the otherwise great night. Do not recommend.' u"We needed a nearby place to have dinner before seeing a show so I chose this one since it seemed to have good reviews. \xa0I like how they have little benches outside so you can wait but I went in because it was way too hot to stay out there.We ordered the fried calamari and shrimp to start which was alright. \xa0It's kind of hard to mess up that dish.I would've given this place four stars but our waiter seemed a little off. \xa0He seemed like he didn't really want to be there and when I was asking him a good wine recommendation to go with my dish I could almost hear the sigh in his voice.Food was awesome though. \xa0And my wine pairing was great as well. \xa0I always get the linguine frutti di mare because it's my absolute favorite Italian dish and I'll never have anything bad to say to about it. \xa0It didn't even have that fishy smell most seafood dishes do which I was glad about. \xa0We even heard the next table say how they haven't licked a plate clean like that in awhile.I'd only come here for convenience since it was literally a block away from our Broadway theatre. \xa0Other than that avoid like the plague unless you're into the Times Square tourist trap hellholes." u'OMG so terrible! \xa0It was everything bad about a theatre district restaurant. \xa0I was hoping that the star ratings would live up to their expectations \xa0but everything was awful.My awful entree was supposed to be fresh pasta with meatballs. \xa0The pasta was NOT fresh the meatballs looked like they were canned and when I asked for fresh grated parmesan cheese I basically got the Kraft very fine graded processed parmesan.My date had some specialty fish they were promoting and they brought talopia that was like cardboard.Just can say anything good about the restaurant other than they were polite enough to let my date and I use the bathrooms after our show was over' u"Cold afternoon and our last day in this amazing city we had to go with pasta and sure glad we did!! Great location cozy beautiful comfortable relaxing even though you are in the middle of everything (right next to Times Square). Friendly servers on top of every detail. Food was delicious!! Pasta was fresh my seafood linguini was really good and the perfect portion. My sister is allergic to shellfish and our server was very attentive to her needs and made sure her dish was made to her satisfaction; she ordered the pasta with meatballs and it was really delicious ( of course I had to try it). We ordered a bottle of wine which went excellent with our entire experience. Desserts were really yummi my dyer really loved her key lime and I simply loved the flan one of my favorites! I'm really glad we went with this place next time in the city i will definitely go back! Highly recommended"]
111.Sushi Seki Hell’s Kitchen,[u"My friends and i had lunch here for restaurant week. It was not busy because of the location perhaps. This restaurant is pretty spacious. The d\xe9cor offered a Zen feeling.I had the nine piece sushi and chef roll. The sushi was good. RW deal pretty good. For dessert i has the matcha crem brulee which was really good. It was the perfect portion if you don't want to overeat. Overall i had a good experience here for restaurant week. I felt like it was good value. The rw menu offers a variety." u"The food is alright. The service is slow though! They definitely need more waiters!!!!! It took forever to get everything like menus.I came here for the matcha cocktail! It's pretty nice it's made of rum and matcha. The matcha flavor is strong. Not bad! My friends also get Sakura cocktail which is based on sake. Lychee one is petty standard one. The drinking menu list is pretty long. My friends think oysters are good. For happy hour around 2-3 per one. I got miso cod for my entree. I like it even though the size is really small for $29. We also shared some other appetizers such as beef sth (with scallions) tofu salad (something healthy) crispy rice with crab (almost all crispy rice like Guo ba in Chinese\u9505\u5df4). For dessert we got matcha creme br\xfbl\xe9e which I like. They also have special fixed menu which is much cheaper and omakase." u"I used to go to the UES location - especially for omakase - but it's always so crowded and difficult to get a reservation at. Didn't realize SS opened an HK location. Same great quality and what feels like twice the space including a second floor. Everything was fresh and tasty - sushi and cooked foods included. The spicy scallop roll and black miso cod were my favorite. And at a fraction of Gari/Nobu prices.Come!! I don't want this place to close." u"Sushi Seki was alright. \xa0The ambiance was slightly sterile and the food selection was not very exciting. \xa0We ordered some small dishes and some sushi. \xa0Everything was decent but you can tell it's not top notch sushi based on the mediocre rice underneath each sashimi. \xa0And it's pricey. \xa0For $50 a person we could have easily been satisfied in many many other choices in Manhattan." u"Food here is pricey but it's pretty good! I would give the food a 4 but the service was a definite 5. I came here with a group of 7 and anyone who's ever dined in the city knows it's rare to have a restaurant seat you before until your entire party is there. Not only did sushi seki seat us right away before the rest of our party arrived they even offered us a private room! \xa0We took off our shoes to enter the private room and they had slip on crocs that you could borrow instead of going through the hassle of putting on your shoes when you went to the bathroom.Half of my party got the 6 course meal which was quite filling! \xa0I opted to get the agedashi tofu and Chilean seabass. The tofu was amazing. I would definitely get that again. It was nice and crispy on the outside and silky smooth on the inside. The dashi complemented it perfectly. The Chilean sea bass was pretty good but one piece that I got was a little on the dry side. I got a yuzu cocktail. Not only was it beautiful but it was delicious. This cocktail is for the true yuzu lover. It wasn't overly sweet and had a nice tangy flavor. It's not for those who dislike sour but was just right for me. I tried a few pieces of sushi and sashimi. While the flavors were great and there was absolutely no need for soy sauce I'm not sure how fresh the fish was. However I may be too spoiled by recently going to Japan and eating sushi straight from the fish market.The overheard us talking about it being my husbands birthday and brought a complimentary green tea creme br\xfbl\xe9e in addition to 3 extra Mochi ice cream. The waitress and waiter were all super sweet and informative and never rushed us. \xa0I would definitely go back!!" u'The sushi rolls are delicious; however they are small in stature about the size of a quarter.The ambience is appealing. The staff is very attentive. But please note that if you do not have a party of six or more you will not be seated in the main dining room. Overall I will give it four stars because the sushi is impeccable despite the small size. Please put this place on your list if you are in New York City.' u"Ambiance and decor: 5Food: 3Service: 4Price: 2This location is absolutely gorgeous spacious and beautifully lit - the opposite of a lot of other New York hotspots. The ambiance makes you really excited for your meal. The servers are attentive without being too pushy and generally pretty fast. Unfortunately the food was just ok and very overpriced for the quality. We ordered a variety of nigiri a few appetizers and salads a couple rolls and a carafe of sake. The rolls were incredibly disappointing with slightly burnt fried soft shell crab and tiny portions. All of the nigiri was fine but at $5+ per piece it's ridiculously overpriced. The most disappointing item we got was the seaweed salad with onion dressing which is mostly a leafy salad with a tiny bit of seaweed and an incredibly strong onion/pungent dressing that was almost inedible. Maybe I'm just going to the wrong sushi spots in NYC but none of the places I've tried thus far have impressed me." u"Upon entering Sushi Seki i was just blown away. The contemporary decor is truly beautiful. This establishment is bi-level. Lunch is served only on the bottom level and the upper level is open for dinner. \xa0Located on the bottom level is a long cocktail bar which serves artisanal cocktails as well as sake and Japanese whiskey and beer. On the main floor there is a communal table which looks really neat and there is also a Kappo bar in front of the open kitchen. Upstairs you will get more of the authentic Japanese feel. The upper level features a sake and whiskey bar sushi bar a few tables on the terrace over looking Hell's Kitchen and the coolest of all tatami rooms! The tatami room is traditional and offers a private dining experience.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Upon arriving I asked Ryan the amazing mixologist to recommend a good drink on the cocktail menu while I waited for my friend. He recommended the Yuzu. It was perfectly garnished served in a ceramic cup and really refreshing. Cocktails run from $13-$19 but they are quality drinks. Now on to my favorite part...the FOOD. Off of the special menu I ordered the mushroom soup with black truffle and the crab scallop and avocado on crispy rice. The mushroom soup was rich and delightful. The crab scallop and avocado with crispy rice was served on a shell. It was really really good. My friend and I ordered the spicy oyster roll and spicy tuna roll. Each order comes with 6 pcs. The spicy oyster roll was amazing!! I couldn't stop eating it. The rolls were so tasty that you don't even need soy sauce. Sushi Seki definitely uses quality and fresh ingredients. The price is really great for the quality of food they serve.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 I will be coming back for more food and more cocktails. I heard they are launching their happy hour specials on Thursdays and Fridays soon. I cannot wait! Not to mention the staff is so friendly and warm and the place is pristine.Sushi Seki gets a 5 star for ambiance food cocktails and service!" u"It was a disappointing dinner and here is why.I walked into this newly opened Japanese restaurant - well decorate spacious friendly staff got its own Japanese sake and whiskey bar - looking to enjoy a good dinner but it failed.None of the dishes I tasted met my expectation:Agedashi Tofu: it was too firm there's no air at all inside the fried tofuSpicy scallop roll: there's no scallop in itTempura roll: not well fried and the shrimp was tinyUni sushi: good but it's Uni you can't fail Uni Miso cod: good fresh fish but way too sweetSea bass: again good fish but the black bean sauce messed up the dish it was too saltyTea: how can a Japanese restaurant not serve its traditional tea but rather have some tea list that charges you $7 for a cup of tea?Overall I might still give the restaurant a try but this place is not anywhere near the level of 15 east yasuda morimoto azabu etc." u"Cute little place in hells kitchen! Loved the interior and staffs were all very nice. We ordered omakase which was around $160/person. It is pricey but also was very good. Interesting chef's choices!" u"With the demise of the old Firebird joint in restaurant row I was eager to see who would come and take over the copious amount of real estate left behind by the Russian stalwart. \xa0In comes Sushi Seki .. in all of its east side glory in the Theater District.To be honest I was a bit skeptical. \xa0Why open a new Japanese restaurant on a street that's full of high level established names (Sushi of Gari 46) .. new entrants (Saki Bar Hagi 46) and pretenders (Osha)? \xa0Clearly the owners feel there is demand for high-quality Japanese food here and for the most part Sushi Seki does not disappoint.The new digs are a big departure from the days when we saw the ornate furnishings of the old Firebird restaurant that made diners think they were taking a trip back in time to the days when the Czar ruled Russia. \xa0Now it's been totally overhauled with the sublime neo-Japanese decor that defines to many new restaurants. \xa0The overall experience - from the huge bar featuring their highly touted cocktails - to the spacious seats - to the simple/clean sushi bar in the back - it all screams modern chic.I decided to give the pre-theater menu a try. \xa0For $42 dollars they offered a simple four course menu with a few choices for each part of the meal. \xa0I opted to start with the agedashi tofu which featured two small pieces of finely fried tofu paired with some warm tempura sauce. It was tasty and simple. \xa0I followed that up with the snow pea salad with house ginger dressing. \xa0This dish was fine and the fresh crispy snow peas really paired well with the savory dressing. \xa0My only qualm was how the dish could have been better had the peas been mixed more with the dressing to accentuate the flavor but this dish should suit those with light palates very well.Since I was in the mood for protein I opted for the beef teriyaki as my entree. \xa0The quality of the meat was fine but I was expecting a better cut. \xa0The meat was a bit more rubbery in texture than I expected and the sauce was also underwhelming. \xa0Given the type of dish it was .. I was expecting the flavors to stand out more. \xa0In this case it didn't feel like the meat and sauce worked in harmony. \xa0The meal wrapped up with my order of red bean panna cotta. \xa0I enjoyed this dish a lot as the sublime custard paired well with the rich red bean flavor. \xa0Again this could have used a bit more red bean to help create more harmony between the milk and azuki flavors but for the most part it was delightful. \xa0One theme seemed to resonate with me based on my initial experience. \xa0While the quality of the ingredients and the flavors were there - there seemed to be instances when the flavors didn't jive completely and certain elements that should have been more robust or pronounced didn't materialize. \xa0The service here was polite but spotty. \xa0At times I had multiple come and ask me the same question. \xa0Other times I had to flag people for attention. \xa0It didn't seem very even to me but given it's a new restaurant these things may take time to shake out. \xa0I will come back to try more of their menu (and sushi) on a future visit but for now I still have to give the edge to Sushi of Gari 46 as the best Japanese joint on restaurant row. \xa0But I do think this place has a lot of potential to take the top spot if they work on some nuances.PS - I did also get to try their tempura udon. \xa0It was good but not remarkable. \xa0The soup base was the best part of that dish ... being light and mostly flavorful." u"I have been hearing about sushi seki for quite sometime and then one day walked by this new location. I decided it was time to try what many of my friends have been raving about. This spot is top notch from the space to the service and of course the food. We got a huge platter of sushi and indulged. We also each got a couple rolls. One my favorite rolls the toro and scallion was phenomenal. The spicy scallop roll which apparently they are known for was also amazing. The drinks here are top notch as well. It's an expensive place but worth it if you want to experience some of the better sushi in NYC." u'Great service"" food"" presentation"" drinksEverything was delightful! My friend and I sat at the sushi bar. You could chose from traditional tables or booths where you sit on the floor. We were greeted with a warm washcloth. We stupidly ordered sushi with salmon belly- it was good and smokey but not worth 18 dollars! Everything else was tasty the fish was very fresh but everything tasted a bit smokey.' u"My friends and I came here for dinner before catching a show on Broadway. We made a last minute reservation had to call and make it a little later but had no trouble at all changing the time. The hostess checked out coats for us and then showed us to our table which was upstairs. They have really nice private dining rooms that seat about 6 they definitely look like something I'd want to try.I ordered the miso soup to start and then my boyfriend and I shared a plate of sashimi. We had yellowtail medium fatty tuna king salmon eel and another one I can't remember. They were all so fresh and delicious! Our waiter Frank was incredibly helpful answering all our questions explaining the specials and giving recommendations. He mentioned that they just recently opened a few months ago and I'm very impressed with the place.We mentioned how pleased we were with the service and they brought complimentary hot green tea! Which hit the spot since it was below 10 degrees that night.Great job Sushi Seki! Will definitely be returning next time I'm in NYC!" u"I used to go to their UES location regularly as I live in the neighborhood but it got almost impossible to get a table there so I am happy about the new HK location which is super convenient for a pre-theater dinner. \xa0I came here twice within a month - once for omakase at the sushi bar and another time for sushi special at a table. \xa0The omakase was as good as I remembered from UES - rice was perfectly cooked and all nigiris were interesting. \xa0Inside the sushi bar felt more casual and lacked the traditional discipline you would typically see at a traditional sushi bar which was a slight disappointment for me. \xa0Sushi special was also good however it obviously lacked the freshness of omekase and some pieces felt dry. \xa0The appetizers were hit and miss - I would stick to the deep fried items like chicken karaage or ebi shinjo. \xa0The panna cotta and green team creme brulee were spectacular. \xa0I really wanted to lick the bowls. \xa0I would definitely go back for pre-theater. \xa0I love the fact that it's much easier to get a table even in the last minute." u'One of the best sake bar in the City is "hidden" on the 2nd Floor. \xa0The sake selection was masterfully put together and will challenge even the most discerning aficionados. The overall decor attention to details and design are sure to get your attention as well.' u"Omg best place for sushi and sashimi. I went here to have one drink and some appetizers before heading out for main dinner. My friend and I ordered a platter for two which costs $35.00...all the fish slices and oysters are so fresh and well seasoned. Put it this way I don't even like raw fish but this is amazing. Five stars all the way. And they chilled my glass before serving prosecco...Will be back for more." u'Great cocktail menu. Tried and loved the Yuzu. Two floors of sushi! And a bar on both floors!' u"Been going to the 1st avenue location for years and always had a good to excellent omikase dining experience. With clients I decided to try the 46th St locale and left with huge regrets and and even bigger check. We did omikase for 4 1-2 drinks each and 2-3 apps=$850!!Ok so it was outrageously expensive I could be ok with that IF the sushi wasn't so dry flavorless uninspired basic. Blech! It was a 4 course omikase with 4 pieces per course. Not a truly great piece in the mix and explained poorly by an uninspired and uncaring server. Suffice to say I'll pass on all Seki's going forward. Since they expanded and are now a small chain the quality has sunk faster than an anchor. Many better options in the city but it's still sad to lose what was a good one. Bye Seki." u'Seriously this is such a beautiful spot with delicious food and amazing drinks. I went when it first opened and it was not super crowded and went again last night and it was about the same. Hoping people try this place out so it stays open!']
47.Hell’s Kitchen,[u"As a connoisseur of Mexican food it means a lot that I came here two nights in a row! I came here with a friend as I was living in the area and we were blown away. We shared a quesadilla and an order of tacos both of which were top notch. We loved it so much we made a reservation for a group of 10 for the next night! The margaritas are humungous! They are so tasty & big and not to mention STRONG! You're definitely getting your moneys worth with the drinks. I highly recommend the cheese quesadilla which is a perfect size portion after you've eaten 3 baskets of chips.The atmosphere here is very ~cool~ with lots of skulls and a long bar in the front of the restaurant. Definitely make a reservation for a big group on the weekends because this place gets poppin!" u'AWESOME HAPPY HOUR. $6 margaritas at the bar for Happy Hour and once that ends their regular priced $12 margaritas are huge and do not disappoint. The ambiance is fund and trendy and there is ample and spacious bar booth and table seating so it never feels overcrowded. Great extensive menu. I was pleasantly surprised with how good their salads were. I had the Chopped Salad with roasted corn mushrooms roasted poblano chile oven dried cherry tomato mint avocado and cashew-chipotle dressing. SO GOOD.' u"Great spot for Happy Hour--margaritas are $6 at the bar. And once Happy Hour is over their $12 margaritas become almost double the size; so it's a really good deal for the city either way. The decor is trendy and fun and there is ample bar booth and table seating so even when it is crowded it doesn't feel overwhelming. Extensive menu with a good amount pleasantly surprisingly good salads. I had their chopped salad with roasted corn mushrooms roasted poblano chile oven dried cherry tomato mintavocado with cashew-chipotle dressing--SO GOOD. And made me feel less guilty about the 3 margaritas and excessive guac I was eating." u"Hell's Kitchen was my dinner choice before a show and based on the rave reviews I had already set my eye on the Brussel Sprout Tacos. \xa0A chalkboard advert outside noted a Happy Hour special. \xa0It included a few different drinks but I went with a Margarita ($5.5).The Margarita?It was HUGE and STRONG! Phew! I'm not really a drinker but I was feeling quite tipsy after ONE.complimentary chips/salsaThe salsa had very mild heat but was wonderfully smoky.Brussel Sprout Tacos ($9)This was pretty darn good: the two tacos were loaded with grilled sprouts and had a slight heat/spice on the sprouts themselves. \xa0The orange sauce on the tacos was slightly smoky and had a very nice flavor. \xa0There was an accompanying green sauce (cilantro-lime-jalepeno?) that was good as well.A (Hispanic) barback actually took care of me but apparently there was a totally different (Caucasian) guy in charge of my check. \xa0I didn't have a second of contact with that guy until he put my check down in front of me. \xa0I wasn't asked if I wanted anything else which was odd because I DID. \xa0I put another order in and the awesome barback gave me a complimentary drink - Devil's Nightcap - with haba\xf1ero and Lim\xf3n. It was definitely something I wouldn't have ordered myself but it was very tasty! What a nice guy: it was very much appreciated!In all it was a tasty dinner and I would go back if I was visiting the Hell's Kitchen area again!" u'DUDE. GUAC & CHIPS. SANGRIA. SLOPPY JOES TACOS. That is all I can say. & during happy hour. Being a tourist in NY you need to come here and eat and drink. They have the best guac in town (in my opinion). We stumbled upon it walking down 9th ave after barcelona bar and it caught our eye. We were hungry and wanted something small and it was during happy hour. It was kind of busy we had to stand for quite a while since the bar was all filled up but ended up getting some free shots of tekillya because of the long wait for a seat. One seat opened but and my friend and I shared the seat. The food was honestly amazing. I want to come back if I end up coming back to NY another time. I would love to try other things on their menu. But happy hour is the way to go!' u"Come here for apps and drinks. There's a wide selection of drinks and beers on tap. Get the trio of guacamole to start. The bartenders and servers here are a delight and I hope it stays that way. You can come here with one person and sit at the bar or a small group and grab a booth. It's pretty loud and gets louder as drinks are flowin' but overall it's casual and fun a competes a bit with arriba arriba next door. Try!" u"Margaritas the size of my face? And they're strong? I couldn't believe it when my friend told me. So I schlepped to 9th avenue to find out on the last of my belated birthday outings. Hell's Kitchen is the perfect destination for a date or a huge group not because its dark interior is all moody and incognito but for the fact that you'll be so lost in conversation you won't notice how slowwwwww the service is. I made the mistake of actually being hungry when I arrived. Oops. A million years later with chips and water in front of us our very sweet and adorably apologetic server arrived. It clearly was his first week; maybe even his first day. He even told us he was new. Of course I had questions. Poor guy! We ordered and he staggered our choices of 2 guacamole - rojo and traditional salmon ceviche (phenomenal) and tacos tacos tacos. Let me just say whatever executive chef came up with the brussel sprout and cashew nut salsa taco should get an award. This was a STAR taco. I want to eat it every day. In fact I want to recreate it at home and eat it everyday. STAR!!With half my classic margarita gone along with the shot of mescal I ordered when I was starving and cranky here appears our adorable server with a tiny cup of chocolate salted mousse and a lit candle. I almost wanted him to sing to me which normally horrifies my ass to no end but I wouldn't have cared thanks to my face-sized beverage. I blew out my last birthday candle tipsy and proud." u"I found this place on open table the seemed to have good reviews so my partner and I decided to give it a try.Ambience- very modernFood - \xa0was amazing my favorite was the Brussels sprout tacoService - \xa0could use a little help the food came out before the drink order and we only ordered two corona's. When the beers finally came they were warm. We told our server and it took them another few minutes to get our drinks. We had finished eating before we were able to start having a drink.I would def go back!" u'Came here for the second time last night! The manager went above and beyond to make sure I had a great experience!The margaritas are fabulous! Our waitress was very attentive and friendly! Highly recommend the fajitas!' u"I love it because there wasn't a huge line... The food is awesome quality ... Got some chicken quesadilla and went lite on the cheese ... A+ My friend Hollis says the Burrito is AHHH-Mazeing ... And Sabie says the fajita is great. So... Looks like you have 3 winners! Check out the restrooms in the back for some sick artwork on the walls." u'This place is great! They have these MASSIVE slushy margaritas which are potent and also the most delicious banana drink (I think its a martini?) with cinnamon sprinkled on top. I went on a Friday night and I was pleased with the crowd and how comfortable the area is. Carlos the bar tender is GREAT - made great drinks and made great conversation even though my group was a little rowdy. Always kept an eye on us. This place is fun and comfortable and not over the top - would definitely come back here!' u'Such great original drinks! The food was phenomenal too. Recommend the other woman drink! And the three different types of guacamole is a must try.' u"Magarita baby I love it ! BIG and STROnG. Taco yummy  I order the plate of three tacos of your choice I'm very impress .The service was great . I'll definitely go back again .And I'm from Canada ....." u'Our server Zack was wonderful and the food was wonderful \xa0That was the best seafood ceviche. \xa0All of the food was delicious! \xa0Highly recommend' u"Only been here once but I freaking LOVE this place & can't wait to come back. New to the neighborhood and decided to check out Hell's Kitchen for drinks and gauc with the hubby. The bar was packed (we went on a Thursday) and we and had to wait for seats but eventually found a spot on the end below a gigantic wine bottle chandelier. \xa0Hell's Kitchen is darker and loungy-er than the other cheesy Mexican restaurants in the hood it feels a little more grown up. The flirty bartender was quick and knew his tequila. He made everyone around us laugh while busting his butt making sure everyone had a drink. The margaritas are huge and made with a good tequila and not sweet. By far the best margs in the neighborhood. No question.The gauc was fresh and it came out fast. They don't have a spice level which was my only problem. We ended up getting the nachos and the octopus too. They were both delicious. Can't recommend this place enough!" u'Happy hour margaritas and nachos - YES. Stumbled upon this place and have returned several times. They had an awesome HH $6 marg special and their nachos are pretty darn good. I like this place a lot more then other places in the area its reasonable with good food a nice bar area and plenty of seating.' u"Went here last night with my mother. We enjoyed the atmosphere but was a bit overdressed. The waitress was nice and attentive. We sat and talked for hours and she didn't seem to mind or rush us. I had a chicken burrito and it was yummy my mother had steak tacos her only complaint was for the menu to show three different cheeses it certainly didn't have much cheese. My drink was a frozen mango margarita and at first was EXTREMELY strong which means you get your money's worth and only need 1-2 before you feel a buzz but also means you're babysitting your drink the entire time. Mid way through I did ask for her to top it off with some more margarita without alcohol. We also had some gauc for the table which I enjoyed. All in all nice place. Across from Ariba Ariba so really to be honest I'd rather dine there which is why I'm giving 4 stars because next to another similar place this wouldn't be my first choice." u'New location for this restaurant (as I never been to the old one). Dark trendy interior with a simple menu of intriguing options.Unfortunately missed the happy hour but still wanted to have something light for a meal. Lots of the items here are incredibly expensive especially for a Mexican place yet settled on the HK chopped salad ($11) and a beer ($7). The salad was of moderate size flavored with a delicious avocado/cashew dressing. Finished it fairly fast with my beer. Also got to try a bit of the "Devils Nightcap" drink which is a very strong and spicy cocktail that lends credence to its name.I would say this is a solid spot for happy hour and to bring a date but I\'m not paying $17 for a burrito.' u"Love this place! I love the food and margaritas was okay. Sometimes it's not that strong maybe it depends of who's bartending but overall it was very good!" u"I made a 5 o'clock reservation for Valentine's Day dinner at this establishment. My girlfriend and I love Mexican and this place seemed to have great ratings. When we entered it was basically empty. We got water and chips/salsa which were quite tasty quickly. We ordered some drinks a few minutes later. At this point it's been a positive experience!Now 10 or so minutes later our waiter comes back explaining some kind of issue with the bar and our drinks which is fine so we order our meals which was the kale salad and a chicken quesadilla. I also asked for another bottle of water as ours was empty and all the while I am seeing patrons that were sat after us being served drinks. About another 15-20mins later we finally get our drinks. This is the last time we see our waiter. We are watching people that sat after us receive their food before us and all we ordered was a salad and quesadilla. Not exactly time consuming meals to make. So basically they forgot we existed. We eventually decided to just leave 1hr20mins later as we had a show to see at 7pm. I'm sure the place has great food but the service was amazingly bad on an important night for it not to be. I usually don't write reviews just rate but I feel this experience merits one."]
146.Merilu Pizza Al Metro,[u"Nice small place in Hell's Kitchen right on 9th Ave. Heard good things so gave it a shot. Grabbed the biggest New York style pie they had without toppings to get a feel for how they do it. Not disappointed. Fresh mozzarella and great sauce. Thin tasty crust. Loved it. Had a slice of mushroom too which is cool that they offer a variety of by-the-slice options. Not too expensive either. Would go back." u"Cute little pizza place with ample seating! A slice goes for around $4-5 depending what you get but I'd say my slice was pretty good.I got the sausage and spinach slice. The type of sausage they used was really good! The sauce crust and cheese were also all great flavors and not overpowering in anyway." u"Amazing pizza! We aren't from NYC so I can't say they're the best in the city but the pizza we ordered from them was absolutely outstanding. We had ordered from another restaurant and gotten excited for our meals but they showed up falling apart missing things from the order and with no utensils. Having had a trying day we were tired and hungry and were going to eat anything. I'm SO glad that we decided to have Merilu! We got a large cheese pizza and the cheese was so even and well layered the sauce was tasty but unintrusive and the crust was crispy and fresh. Definitely check this place out!" u'Merilu always offers the Finest brick oven pizza "Eva". Consistent for almost 6 years. Brilliant familia of yours Maggie. Thanks for the continued amazing services. Blessings always!' u"This is one of those pizza places that falls between being a dollar-slice spot and a sit-down-with some-wine joints. Not fancy but not quite hole in the wall either.Several options of thin slice rectangle pizzas (sold as two squares together). Settled on a Margherita ($4ish) and a Hawaiian ($5). Crispy crusts and fresh-tasting cheese and mozzarella. Like the pineapple/ham combo on the Hawaiian though was hoping for heartier ingredients to get me full. I like the concept here: thin fresh square slices to combat the thick oily slices you normally get at competitors. Personally wasn't really full after the meal so figure this is more of a quick snack type of pizza." u"Their pizza is amazing! This is probably the BEST pizza on the west side. The staff is so friendly as well which makes it even more enjoyable unlike other pizzerias on the west side. Not to bad with pricing either. If you're ever on the west side grab pizza from here because you will not regret it.10/10 pizza10/10 customer service" u"The to go slices were warmed and came out of the oven very crispy. Not a big fan of super crispy crunchy pizza slices. The toppings were fresh and delicious - but this is the first place I've been to in a long time where I scraped off the toppings and threw away the crust." u"* Seating available * No bathroom * You can buy by the slice * $10 minimum for credit card * $5 a slice I've had worse slices that made it on lists as the best pizza in new york city so why shouldn't this place be on a list?? \xa0Here is an example of a few places: prince street pizza (without the pepperoni it's an average slice) NY pizza supreme Joe's pizza etc. This is how I ended up here: The grand opening of denino's pizzeria & Tavern was today so I decided to stop by and grab a garbage slice that's the name of the slice. when I arrived the hostes informed me that this location can't serve slices for now because of some restrictions from the local community board obviously that pissed me off but it didn't cool me down from my crave for pizza... \xa0So After doing some research the only pizzerias that were still open at the time were the usual late night spots but denino's got me looking for something different so I broadened my search to all over the city and stumbled upon this quaint little joint not far from totto's ramen so I was like let's do it! I got there past midnight and most of the staple slices that I wanted to try were gone I suppose the pizza gods were not happy with me that was my second disappointment of the night after not being able to check out denino's but I still \xa0settled for a spicy meat slice the guy behind the counter told me that it's the best option for now. The pizza itself was solid enough to want to come back for more I liked the crust it's a Roman style long bread the balance and quality of the toppings not to mention the spicy meat itself! It was a bit addictive... \xa0For now based on a less favorable slice the only thing I can say is what I mentioned earlier: that it's better then a lot of top 10 pizzerias in new York... \xa0But I hope to be back to try some of their other \xa0slices like the rustica Buffalo chicken etc. And by then I'll be able to rank this joint more accurately... \xa0 Ps. The following rant is about these lists ranking pizza places in new York... My philosophy on pizza is very plural the more the better! I don't think authenticity should win over taste or longevity over experimental... \xa0just because you have been around longer or your pizza is more authentic doesn't mean you should dominate lists Especially when the market has so much more to offer... \xa0You are depriving all of us! On two recent lists published online four out of ten on that list were big no-no's the only reason why they were on it was because of their history and what not... I can guarantee you that Almost any dollar slice will beat these four in a pizza competition... \xa0I simply don't get it It's new York for **** sake! We are blessed with so many options and even if you are not happy with the current options there will always be a new pizza place opening up down the block. so why not diversify these lists??" u"Their pizza is amazing. I've never been to the actual store but their delivery is always fresh and the pizza is never soggy. My favorite pies are their Prima Vera and Angelina both extremely unique and packed with flavor. I took off one star because when we order their Margherita pizza many times it will show up without basil which is kind of the point of a Margherita slice. Recently we noticed that when you order their Margherita in parentheses it says something along the lines of basil based on availability. I can't help but laugh is there a basil shortage in New York City that I do not know about? Other than that overall delicious pizza." u'This place is the best pizza in NYC HANDS DOWN .. Perfect for margherita pizza real old school feel with unique taste' u'Pretty good! Nice flavor and nice service. I ordered the gluten-free margarita pizza. Everything is really delicious the crust was a little interesting I enjoy experimenting with gluten-free.I think the crust is a little overdone it tasted more like a cracker then pizza dough but the taste was still very good' u'Absolutely awesome customer service from the minute she picked up the phone!Frustrated from trying to order delivery online...i called in. \xa0Order was easy to make so many good choices diff for this CA girl... But they were very helpful and patient.We ordered pepperoni pizza and The Fresca- like a margerhita but with added tomatoes and basil drizzled with olive oil and sea salt. Small pizzas the size of larges. Garden salad sodas Garlic bread and its just me n my daughter for her Sweet 16 at midnight in NYC! She even added in a Spumoni Bomba for the birthday girl! With a sweet bday wish wrapped on the bag! Everything arrived in less time than she said. Delivery guy very cool. Pizzas were a little well done but very tasty. Garlic bread lil burnt too but EXCELLENT flavorSalad is giant!The Fresca- lite and fresh!! We will have pizza for days enough to bring home.' u"In-house made mozzarella cheese-- awesome pies! \xa0Can't wait to get back to NYC for another slice." u'Pizza is good too good.' u'Great pizza but also great customer service. I may have had a little late night mishap in front of the store (i.e. vomit) and they were SO nice about it....So sorry for the mess. You guys are the best.' u"Pizza is great. Had delivery only. Add breaded chicken you won't be disappointed! Chicken roll is warm crisp and full of taste. Love it!Eggplant Parm Roll is just fab!!" u'I honestly came here with a friend who was a picky eater and needed a byob place. And surprise their pizza was really really good. I will be coming back here.' u"If you're craving some classic New York-style pizza Merilu is a great place to go. The crust is thin and satisfyingly crisp with contrasting creamy slightly oily cheese. Mmmm. We ordered a slice of the Tim's pizza - no sauce with ricotta and mozzarella cheese - and another slice with tomato sauce mozzarella cheese and mushrooms (unsure of the name). Both were very good but we preferred and highly recommend the Tim's pizza. The lady behind the counter was very pleasant and even cut each of the slices in half for us with a smile on her face without a fuss. We can't wait to come back and try the margherita pizza di Merilu (gorgonzola cheese pears walnuts & truffle oil) and the prosciutto di parma!" u'I am going to make this as simple as possible for why you should not order delivery from Merilu Pizza Al metro. Dining in might be a different story but alas I can only report on my own adverse experience. Plus I\'d just like to mention I take no pleasure in this but Pizza must be respected. You cannot disrespect pizza or you will incur the wrath of the pizza masses to rise up and strike you down which will commence now.1) Price: Listed online as the pizza is clearly priced at $22. Exibit A: (seamless.com/menu/merilu\u2026) not bad you might say reasonable for some dough with cheese on top. Well I hope you like surprises at your door because Surprise!! Delivery guy wants $38. Now I know this is NYC and after living here for a few months I\'ve come to terms with the unavoidable culture of business here. One in which the status quo is to treat your customers like a cheap saloon girl after one too many moonshines but somethings I just cannot swallow. So I say "hmm $38 that\'s not $22 to this fine gentleman" he immediately rebuttals with a response that clearly has been honed over a long illustrious career of having to be the face of this business\' shady pricing tactics "oh that\'s because you ordered the large here I will call them to tell you". So ready to answer my question now that\'s how you disarm an angry mindless customer. I actually feel bad for this delivery guy I\'m pretty much certain if I had to do his job I\'d develop a tick in both eyes. 2) Time: So I waited 2 hours for a pizza delivered 5 blocks away. I could\'ve literally crawled in a prone position arrived at the physical shop eaten and crawled back to my apartment faster than this. No this is not hyperbole the distance is that bloody close. Okay okay calm down one has to be fair and balanced right? So they did tell me it would take an hour for the pizza which I agreed to. After all good things come to those that wait eh well that\'s what my Mormon ex always told me Still though that\'s too long to wait and I was on the verge of a full blown first world rage bonanza. 3) Taste: I could\'ve found it in my pizza neglected heart to forgive these previous transgressions against my now belligerent warmongering stomach if only the taste were on point. Aaaaaaannnnnnnddddd....its gone its flavorless COLD pizza for me a first world disaster as its very best. Nope no absolution for you Merilu. This really deserves a subsection so here: Also for reference I ordered the Robbie D Pizza. a. Crust: Dry flavorless and harder than back of my abusive nanny\'s hand on the sabbath. Imagine eating a burnt stale baguette that has become so hard that it would require alligator-like jaw strength to adequately chew for the normal initial human digestive process.b. Sauce: I saw something red that looked like it might be sauce but I never tasted it. There was barely any sauce on this actual pizza. At about my third bite I could actually hear my Italian grandmother from Napoli calling me a pansy for not sending this pizza back and using it as a projectile to inform the owner of my dissatisfaction. \xa0c. Cheese: It\'s really hard to mess up cheese unless you\'re a vegan that is. Merilu your cheese tasted like string cheese my nephew could\'ve melted and lobbed onto any plane shaped object. So congrats you\'re on par with a 4 year old in the cheese department.d. Meats: Pepperoni: Forgettable Sausage: Disgusting just gross. Really I would rather watch a documentary on how sausage is made and look at pictures of turtle penises than eat any more of that greasy brown oval shaped abomination you mislabeled as sausage. And there you are dem internets a simple and totally subjective review of my experience with Merliu al Metro. I hope you elect to choose another pizza shop that finds it distasteful to pull fast ones on customers \xa0at their apartment doors and also don\'t suffer from Ageusia.' u'Their pizza are always fresh tasty and flavorful. I would order here anytime and never be disappointed.']
135.Balkanika,[u"Have been to Balkanika around 4-5 times for dinner. During the week shouldn't be much of a problem to get seated right away on weekends it tends to be a bit more crowded.Overall my experiences have been good.Decor- rustic somewhat plain but overall niceService- hit or miss would never say the service is bad but sometimes it is faster than others. This may be attributed to the kitchen staff more than the front of house staff.Food- the Greek salad with chicken is very good. Have also had the chicken kebab which is in a red roasted pepper rub and comes with a few veggies. The sides are excellent such as the Russell sprouts broccoli  asparagus  beans  and hummus. Highly recommend doing a trio or one of the offers they have in regards to the sides.Will keep returning when looking for a basic Mediterranean style place in Hell's Kitchen ." u"It was totally empty when I had lunch on a Thursday so that was a little sad (and also not a great sign).They appeared to have lunch specials but I was on an expense account so I ordered cevapcicci little hand-formed Balkan sausages that I hadn't eaten since I was a kid and they were VERY good. It was served with thick yogurt and a red pepper kind of sauce.The bread was sort of a cross between focaccia and pita." u'This place used to be LOVELY but I think they\'re under new management now :(The waiter was a skinny man with an accent (Saturday night 5/28/16 around 8 pm). My friends and I asked for separate checks from the beginning (we were a group of three) and he seemed thoroughly confused by this. To the point where we explained to him what it was he stared blankly at us and then we silently downloaded Venmo onto our phones and said nevermind.The menu was served on printed out pieces of paper and not in a plastic menu like it always has been. Which told me . . . new management. And considering this used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant (I live on 48th & 9th!) that\'s saying something.I ordered the kashkaval fondue as usual and a side of broccoli. The side of broc is $7 which I already know is ridiculous but as the menu says it\'s steamed made with garlic and very tasty.My friends ordered a kashkaval fondue for them as well as their own dishes. When our fondues came out they brought us all of it in one just a bigger portion. I explained to the waiter that I wasn\'t interested in sharing mine since that was my meal and we ordered two fondues not one big one. He was very confused by this. Eventually we got two.He forgot to light the fondue. A girl came by later with light brown hair. I told her they weren\'t lit and she looked at it and says "I think they are." "Do you see a flame underneath?" I asked. Then she went to ask someone else who said it wasn\'t lit. After 10 minutes of this (no exaggeration) we finally got our fondue hot.But remember the $7 broccoli? Not hot. COLD. FREEZING COLD. Not even cold--frozen. And . . . I kid you not . . . there were six pieces of broccoli florets. Six. Done in six forkfuls. For $7.The waiter never once refilled our drinks (water) or asked how our food was. It wasn\'t even busy and I\'ve worked food service so I always give benefit of the doubt. But your job as a server is to serve food and make sure things are okay.I didn\'t tip him. I feel like a total jerk but considering he did our checks wrong gave us the wrong food wouldn\'t answer questions served me FROZEN small broccoli and didn\'t light our fondue not only do I feel that was justified but I will no longer be returning here or taking friends here. You\'ve lost my business and I am upset.' u"Looking for a pre-show dinner spot near the performance venue we found this Macedonian restaurant on Yelp. The reviews were good so we gave it a try. With minor flavor differences the food is similar to that in most Greek or Turkish restaurants. Mainly we had mezes and sides all of which were satisfying if not standouts. The grilled trout entree was probably the best item we had. Wines were eclectic and a bit on the expensive side in terms of mark up. It's not fancy. The menus is laminated and spiral bound. I will say this the place was packed and people were having a good time. There was lots of positive energy in the crowd. Service was efficient and we finished in plenty of time to walk over to the show. \xa0Overall a good experience." u'Decent restaurant serving Balkan food. The Balkans is a large region in southeast Europe which includes many countries like Greece Albania Romania Turkey and more. If you have been to restaurants with Mediterranean cuisine you will know what to expect. A lot of grilled meat with rice kebabs spinach pies and stuffed vegetables. The restaurant itself is very classy looking. It is dimly lit with an intimate feel to it. Food was good with very flavorful meat. Out of all the dishes we had I would say that the chicken kebabs were the best tasting. Portion sizes though are fairly small for what they charge. Expect a few bits of meat with a little bit of rice or veggies on the side.' u'For the quality I thought the food here was overpriced (yes even for New York standards). Also the service was a bit slow despite the fact that the restaurant wasn\'t at capacity. My boyfriend and I shared the $50 meat combo for 2 the red pepper and walnut meze (a dipping sauce) with complimentary pita bread and a bottle of wine (wines under $25 are complimentary with the meat combo!). The highlight of my meal was definitely the bottle of "Superior Daron 2012" dry red wine that the waitress suggested. It was on the sweet end for red wine. The red pepper and walnut meze was quite tasty as well and went really well with the pita bread. The meat on the other hand which was supposed to be the highlight of the night did not make a lasting impression on me. From the lamb sausage to beef sausage to the chicken skewer to all the other meats on the platter I didn\'t think any of it was particularly outstanding in flavor or quality. I likely would find street skewer meat that is more tasty and not $50.I think the meat combo is far too heavy for me to ever want to order again. I could consider coming back for the meze or the wine or maybe some of the seafood on the menu...' u"Horrible service food was unoriginal and all had the same flavoring. We ordered the sides platter with a cheddar fondue.The sides we ordered were - eggplant brussel sprouts cauliflower and potatoes. They were all flavored exactly the same and drenched in oil. The fondue was too thick not enough heat. I would never think about going back. The restaurant was about 85% full and the servers were running around like all was breaking loose. We tried to order an extra side of bread because the fondue came with pita bread (who does that) and it never came. I couldn't get a water refill ever." u"Not my favorite place. They do have great platters to share. Maybe I wasn't feeling the food that day because I wasn't feeling well and I was very tired. But the platters I think are the best deal with 3-4 kinds of meats and it comes with bread and sauces." u"very nice Macedonia restaurant. Meat plate for 2---$50 and the photo appetizer which I couldn't remember the name... $25 for all. Good for meat lover." u"I ordered quite a few of the vegetable sides because I was feeling a bit vegetable-deficient and was incredibly disappointed. I find it hard for any decent restaurant to fail at making reasonable sides but the asparagus had an off-taste to it the brussels sprouts were soggy and if the rest of the dishes weren't too salty they were too bland. Unfortunately I have nothing good to say about Balkanika and won't be ordering from them again." u'Being that my family is originally from Croatia. \xa0I was fascinated with the \xa0menu at Balkanika. \xa0Food and drink from the Balkans and the Mediterranean is flavorful and amazing.I split a meze sampler plate with my friend . it offered a choice of dips \xa0from a selection of 18. It was served with a basket of warm focaccia and pita bread. \xa0With the crisp Croatian wine it was a light dinner and very tasty. \xa0For me the highlight and item i keep on returning for as take out is the Spiniach Burek or also named B\xf6rek. \xa0 Homemade filo pie stuffed with feta cheese and spinach. \xa0They have also cheese meat and potato versions.' u'Overpriced for me personally but it is the city. The Crepe was okay. Plating was great!' u"Balkanika - my favorite restaurant in New York. everything I've ordered has been five star. the prices beat any decent restaurant in nyc and the service is top notch. I've had big parties and intimate meals here. they have a great wine list and the turkey meatballs is the best dish in the city. if they were closer to me I'd eat here every day." u"Went here with my Serbian husband. The food is good (his mom's is better)...it is reasonably priced for NYC. We would probably eat here again." u"This is a GEM! \xa0I'm not even sure why it doesn't have more stars! My cousin and I came here before a show and ordered a choose 6 Mezes with the # 1 4 6 8 9 & 16. We also got 2 spinach Bureks and a bottle of wine. I was in heaven! \xa0Everything was so tasty so flavorful and the service was wonderful. \xa0We also came on a Friday night and were able to be seated right away. \xa0Which was great considering we had a show to catch at 7:30. \xa0This place had great lighting it was very cozy still felt very familyesk but would be a wonderful wonderful date spot too. \xa0Seriously please eat here!" u'Before I start rambling I have to admit that I am NOT the biggest fan of mediterranean / mixed turkish & greek food but this place I am very okay with.I\'ve been here twice now both times with a party of 4+ people & we\'ve all loved the dishes. We ordered:Mezes Sampler - $26 - would not recommend if you don\'t have at least 6 people. The plate itself comes SUPER colorfully and big but out of all the mezes I tried I probably only liked 4 of them (can\'t tell you which ones bc I honestly had no idea what I was eating...) Zucchini Pancakes - $12 - super creative way of cooking zucchini but I would have liked it to be less soggy and crispier. It comes in 4s / pretty reasonably sized - a little bit smaller than your typical buttermilk pancakes. Greek Salad - $11 - \xa0I could honestly eat this salad all day and I don\'t even like salads that much! It is the freshest salad I\'ve ever had and I order this every time I come here! The feta cheese is amazing. Balkanika Signiture Salad - $12 - this is a Greek / Turkish version of the Italian caprese salad. The cheese is grilled and stacked on top of a slice of tomatoe and a basil leaf. Do NOT get scared away by the "beets" description (like I would have had I paid more attention at the time of ordering) - I did not taste beets at all. Stuffed Eggplant - $12 - did not look appetizing at all. It looked like enchiladas that have been drowned in chile con queso. I still gave it a try but given that I\'m not a big fan of babaganush this dish was just okay.Chicken Shishkebab - $16 - This was my favorite part of the meal bc I\'m a carnivore. Chicken was super tender & juicy and the potatoes & peppers were perfect! I feel like I would have liked it more if I weren\'t so full from the other dishes that preceeded this one. That being said I would opt for the Salmon if I could. At $4 more you get to choose 3 sides. If you are self conscious / want to avoid carbs salmon is definitely the better option! The food came pretty slowly but we ordered a lot and the waitress was super nice!I\'m giving it 3.5 stars bc one thing that really took me off guard was that BOTH the plate and the glass they gave me were dirty. There was a grain of some sort stuck to the inside of the glass and there was dried pea paste or something similar underneath the plate I was given. Yuck! Please double-check next time you bring out the plates & cups!Oh also they have this giant TV that just displays pictures of their dishes...it breaks off the interior design theme and frankly I think that TV could be put to better use.' u"There's only one thing that you really need to know about Balkanika: they serve cheese wrapped in chicken wrapped in bacon.That is all." u"An ok Mediterranean restaurant. Nice ambience nothing special about the food. Same mezes (small appetizers) like hummus baba ganoush red peppers assortment of dips and spreads. A nice bourek and stuffed pepper but that was it. I don't have a great memory of the place. It would be better if they have live music which I think they might have on weekends.A little bit on the expensive side for the quality of food" u"Of all of the restaurants on 9th Ave. at the height of the dinner hour I wondered why this one was nearly empty. Was it the space or the food or the service? Seems to be all three. It's a Turkish restaurant so the food may not suit typical pre-theater diners amongst the Mexican Irish Italian Thai and BBQ choices along the avenue. The salmon dish with three sides was just OK and the calamari that my godson had really should not have been served. The space itself is kind of hard and cold with tile everywhere. On the bar floors and walls. Finally the service. There was nothing above and beyond but nothing overly flawed. Visit if you're crunched for time but don't be expected to be blown away." u'Food was great! I really loved it. I went here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Saturday night. The food was really good and the atmosphere is average so I am giving 4 stars. Stuff was friendly and the food came quick with no delays. Standout items we had were the zucchini pancakes cheese burek and chicken stuffed with cheese and mushrooms and wrapped with bacon (chicken uvijac). We are definitely going back.']
179.Georgio’s Country Grill,[u'Above par diner food/neighborhood gem - huge menu (something for everyone) food is always fresh and prices are reasonable. The trifecta of a good resto! I love ordering brunch from here but come in often because the omelettes come with fresh squeezed juice or coffee/tea and on a good day the huge windows are open letting a nice breeze in. Service is good - quick in and out. No frills. Takes reservations on opentable.' u'On our way out & wanted to get a bite to eat before the late night began ... Seems like unless it was a bar most of the food places were either closed or closing It was around 1130pm this place was open so we decided to give it a try. Came in & we were seated right away once seated we got some drinks I had a Cosmo not bad drink was good  my friend had a Brooklyn lager beer good as well.For a small restaurant they sure have a large menu .. Lots to choose from Food I had the personal Pizza cheese w fresh garlic comes with a salad or soup I got the salad. Salad was not bad pretty tasty vinaigrette dressing. Pizza was good as well the garlic gave it a nice taste  decent size personal. My friend had a Burger & fries  good burger meat was tasty & the fries were good.Small restaurant  simple decor .. Service was good & prices were not bad.' u"I had a large group with me and we were looking for a place to grab a reasonably priced bite to eat in the area. Thankfully Georgio's was able to accommodate us.For my main meal I decided to go with the grilled chicken and a side of broccoli. This dish was pretty no frills as it came with grilled chicken--no marinade or rub just plain--and some steamed broccoli. Though the dish was pretty uneventful it was pretty generous and definitely was more than enough food for me.Overall the vibe of this place is a bit divey and the prices correlate. The service was friendly but not super attentive. In addition nothing looked super spectacular but everyone seemed satisfied with their meals." u'Staff and a great dinner saved the night! Wine x 2 was settling and comforting. Bread and butter made me feel safe. Olives salty and oily and savoring! Salad good and crisp! Angel hair with heavenly mushrooms were the best I ever had!! Tender light  creamy seasoned to perfection! Duck breast tender and flavorful! Got to sit by window and people watch. Thank you for testing me so nice.' u'This place never disappoint. Love the service. The bread and olives that they serve at the beginning are wonderful. Always go with one of the specials!' u'I stopped in for dinner with family and a few friends and quite frankly I was disappointed particularly after reading some of the glowing reviews on Yelp. Maybe the breakfast menu is better. I found the Mediterranean Salad to be really perfunctory in execution (mostly just some Romaine lettuce some tomato and red pepper pieces and feta cheese crumbled on top (see photo) with nothing else. Dressing on the side which seemed like a factory-made dressing. The individual pizza was okay but nothing to write home about either - I had to wonder if it was previously frozen. The Cajun Salad got better reviews however. The staff was competent but seemed generally indifferent to us as customers. I didn\'t think anything on the menu was much of a bargain in terms of pricing. "Meh" sums it up. It is however a kid-friendly place note the pizza if you\'re bringing them. I might give them another try and perhaps for breakfast but for now just 2 stars.' u'I went on Tuesday night here on a casual date - pretty solid choice! I was really impressed by the basket of bread and the olive oil. It tasted like there were literally pressing the olives themselves in the back.The menu is nothing eccentric or exotic but they do have bison burger. Think wraps salads pasta and a burger.' u'Went here on a Saturday between Broadway shows - it\'s a bit of a theatre hangout. Don\'t think you\'re going to see Hugh Jackman though !I\'m talking about stage hands musicians ushers actors most people don\'t know.They go because it\'s clean has hearty good food good service & reasonable prices. It\'s on 9th Avenue so it\'s not touristy.My friend & I went for country fried chicken. He\'s from Texas so he KNOWS country fried chicken. The menu said it comes with "greens" so we asked what kind. \xa0The server didn\'t know so she checked. This is a good thing. I don\'t expect servers to know the answer to every question but be willing to check without my having to ask them to. She came back with a funny answer though: broccoli. Some days it\'s green beans she said. So they define "greens" simply as a green vegetable. We didn\'t mind but I mention it for purists. The mashed potatoes had a sort of potato-flake consistency in some spots. Not sure what that was about.We didn\'t get dessert but we had a couple of mojitos. I like light drinks but this was extraordinarily light. The mint was so fresh though that I think they must have a mint plant in the kitchen.Recommended.' u'Stopped in for breakfast one Saturday morning and really great food cozy environment and definitely better experience outside of touristy Times Square.' u'The very definition of mediocre I\'m sad to say. \xa0Not sure how this even has 3 stars. \xa0Stopped here to get some diner food for a quick dinner before a show and while we did not have high expectations this place managed to be more stunningly mediocre than we could have guessed. \xa0The server forgot to bring us our drinks until our food came out so we were pretty thirsty and neglected feeling. \xa0It turned out that the wings listed in the appetizer section are just deep fried drumsticks not wings with any wing sauce on them (BOOOOOO!) and the meat was not good quality at all. \xa0The fries were again the epitome of mediocrity. \xa0My husband\'s burger was "okay." \xa0And then they tried to push cheesecake on us at the end. \xa0And it was overpriced. \xa0Wish we had gone to any of the other places nearby. \xa0Sigh.' u"Great food and always great service! I work a few blocks away and always come here with my coworkers when we want to have dinner! The pasta is great and filling and it's also big so you get your bucks worth. And they never mind when a bunch of us are loud in the restaurant. Lol :) Good for groups good service good all around." u'Decided to try this place for breakfast based in part to Yelp reviews and the fact that it was about 3 blocks from our hotel. Very busy on a Saturday morning. It\'s pretty cramped when busy!Food was solid. Nothing special but solid breakfast favorites and the coffee was good. Couldn\'t beat the price just a few blocks from midtown.Overall a great place to stop if you are looking for a quick casual "sit down" \xa0breakfast.' u"My wife and I stopped here one evening for dinner around 10:30 after got out of work. It took far too long for them to acknowledge us at the table. Beyond that my fries were overlooked her wrap tasted nothing like a caesar wrap and I had the smallest double decker grilled cheese I've ever seen. They were fairly attentive after the evening progressed but I wouldn't waste my money again. The quality just wasn't there for a 9th Ave restaurant. To say the least when we left we were disappointed." u'Ordered the cobb salad and asked to replace olives with a hard boiled egg. Restaurant charged me $2 for that. Salad came with burnt and dry chicken wilted and stale lettuce and nothing had been chopped or cut. Pretty bad service for a $20 salad.' u"Ok-first we live in the neighborhood and have eaten everywhere. There are three great reasons to eat at this place: 1) this is a great value! 2) very diverse menu with good food and 3) always good service. The food is always good and the specials are always fresh. We recently had the Turkey special and it was excellent....like Thanksgiving. We had wine beer appetizers salads and the turkey and it was about $90 for both of us. Another point to mention is that this is the Bly traditional American kitchen that I know of in Manhattan. We're lucky to have it in the neighborhood.We will continue to support this local establishment" u'Great food great service :) Omelettes come with our choice of juice AND tea or coffee!!' u"Hearty good food with great service and a huge menu...Georgio's is a bistro-diner hybrid. I can't recommend the Angel Hair Primavera w/ Chicken enough. The dish is large enough for dinner and lunch the next day. It comes with a ton of julienne vegetables pasta and chicken (and a side salad or soup of the day). I'll have to be back for some breakfast...that's the true test of a place like this' merit." u"Come here for lunch time to time. It is pricey. Beware when you order sometimes they change things and do not tell you. For example ordered a sandwich off the special menu it said it was on ciabatta bread. It came on raisin bread. When I asked for it to be changed - there was no apologizes and the staff seemed annoyed. Also there was a dressing on the sad which which also was not mentioned. This isn't the first time this has happened here. I also don't find the staff overly friendly or accommodating. This last visit might be my last." u"Stellar diner type of place! I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints. Clean and down to earth. One of my go to places for breakfast/brunch in Hell's Kitchen!Great omlettes and burgers. The wraps are also really tasty. They have fruit smoothies that are to die for! The portions are always good so you will NEVER leave hungry.The wait staff are all friendly here too." u'Not really that great. Food was aight. Service was okay. Nothing to write home about..']
65.Cielo At the Mayfair,[u'My family and I ate here before attending a Broadway show (Kinky Boots). It would have been fortuitous if we were attending Book of Mormon since that is next door.We originally went here since the restaurant has gluten free pasta and I was glad we did. I have two finicky teenage step children and they loved everything they ate. The staff was great and the ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic. Do yourself a favor and come have dinner here.' u'Go to Carmine\'s or Ellen\'s Stardust-- lol -- you get the point! Rudest service I\'ve encountered in NYC. Arrived after a matinee. Should have gone back to the hotel and boiled some water and poured some sauce. Food was okay. The people are a zero. Lots of "badittude". Word to the wise : AVOID AT ALL CO$TS. NOT WORTH IT AND THE NAME IS AN ILLUSION. No mistake. We saw The Crucible and were seated under a large hard blowing ceiling vent that caused our hair to look as if we were in a convertible. I also recall ordering a cappuccino and having to ask for it and then it was delivered by the person that sat us under the blowing fan dressed in black -certainly wasn\'t a waitstaff because she stood there with the cup across the table from me and the others and held the handle and expected me to reach over a few people and grab the hot cup as opposed to it being served to me. There were also dirty dishes/plates left on the table that we had to ask to be removed - ie appetizer dishes and soup bowls when entrees came and table was overflowing. There were too many things that were wrong for me to forget. It was also my friends 30 wedding anniversary and there was little engagement from practically anyone working there. I speak Spanish and Italian so I know what cielo means. \xa0I was writing as if I expected to see some divine or unique place - as unusual and unique as the sky but saw nothing remotely unique or special about it especially the attitude of most all those working there. I don\'t even recall the food it must not have been so good as to think the way we were treated was worth the taste. Basically- I can go to Carmine\'s or some other chain or large scale place and get the same fare with perhaps a bit more ambience - even if it\'s hyper pseudo - like Buca di Beppo. At least they don\'t have a gigantic blowing fan and impolite hostess/ waitstaff/servers. It\'s festive and the overall food experience isn\'t anything special however I can leave there with a smile as the "experience" is different as well as pleasant. Thanks for your apology. We won\'t be back however.' u"Loved the atmosphere feels like being inside a castle. Staff was nice and attentive. It wasn't over crowded or blasting music like most places before a show. Food was good not great. If you're looking for a place to go pre-theater and you're not a snob this place is great." u'Loved our experience! \xa0We were running late due to traffic and the hostess could not have been nicer or more accommodating. The waiter was very helpful advising us what items would be a good pick since we had limited time before the theatre. \xa0He was very friendly and attentive. \xa0The food was so delicious - my daughter is a tough customer and she raved over her grilled salmon dinner. \xa0Great pre-theatre restaurant choice. \xa0Really nice ambience as well.' u"Surprisingly quiet bar-restaurant. We had their cheese ravioli and penne vodka/rosa and both were delicious! It's not such a *classy* place but the service was fast and the food was great." u"When we walked down the stairs into this place we weren't sure what to expect. Loved the style of this resturant and the atmosphere. The place isn't crowded like most of the mainstream restaurants in the city. But don't be fooled every one of our dishes was filled with flavor!" u"Service: awesome. Food: on point. Creaminess was perfect not too heavy not too sweet. I got angel hair pasta with the wild mushroom cream sauce and capers on top. It's not on the menu but they'll do it if you ask. Super sweet staff! Atmosphere: cutest little bar area. Definitely wanna drop by on a snowy evening for some drinks :)Price: worth it. Very happy with the experience and I will definitely be returning!" u"This is my favorite find in the theater district. I've taken many visitors here and everyone loves it. The food is exquisite and they are incredible at meeting any dietary needs or requests. (My dad can't have any salt and there have never been so many things available to him in the menu because they make almost everything from scratch after you order.)The service is also wonderful. They also have a great deal on wine carafes. I can't recommend this place enough. Great ambiance great music incredible food." u'The garlic bread (complimentary) was amazingly delicious. I ordered the linguine with spinach and mushrooms and the dish was flavored perfectly. The waitresses were very friendly.' u"Went into this little place after arriving in the city late. We had a nice little table near the front window that was a couple of steps up from the rest of the dining room- very cozy spot. The chicken milanese was soooo good here. The red sauce on the pasta had the perfect amount of sweet and spice. I read a lot of GREAT reviews of this place so I was expecting a little more out of it. Our focaccia didn't seem very fresh and one downside was I that I found the salad dressing a little bland. I would come back to try the homemade pasta instead. I bet that's their specialty." u'Great evening before seeing Waitress on 47th. First I should give 5* to yelp... it was so easy to put in the address of our theater and skim to find an awesome restaurant within a couple blocks. I made our reservations using yelp and it was seamless and So Easy!Second I should give 5* to Bella who really made the evening. She was so warm and inviting to our family. After 3 days of being bumped around the subways and streets of NYC it was really nice to be treated with a friendly face. Bread was delicious. They were happy to customize a pasta dish for my vegetarian daughter. Loved the ravioli. Fantastic salads. We also loved the cool and quiet ambiance. We will definitely be back!' u"We had a terrific pre-theater supper here on Saturday. Busy but not crazy-crowded. The tables aren't crammed cheek to jowl. Lively but not noisy. The menu (available online) is populated with classic dishes that are thoughtfully selected. So it's a helpful page front and back not one of those perplexing books of endless options. We enjoyed some starters for the table: first-rate fried calamari; really excellent bruschetta plus prosciutto and melon. All five of us enjoyed our various main courses including a 'paleo-friendly' one made with gluten-free pasta. My farfalle in a tomato-cream sauce was spot on generously flecked with salmon. Service by Mel was generous and professional. Mel showered us with attention and really made it a memorable night. We come to NYC once or twice a year and we've found our go-to spot for excellent by-the-book Italian. Heavenly indeed." u"Had a very unpleasant dining experience here thanks to our server. So as many other reviews mentioned it is a small cosy place with homemade kind of food. Like really small there was no waiting and just one server who was both bar tending and managing tables. There weren't many people when we went and my husband had to get up from his seat and ask the sever to take our order imagine. We waited quiet a while for her but she was busy chatting with people at the bar or on her phone. Even after we were done with dinner we waited again for her to get the cheque or even ask if we want deserts. Finally my husband again had to call her out and very rudely she replied if we can give her a minute. She almost frowned neither bothered to wish us a good night or say a thank you. What was she doing you guessed right chatting? If she was busy taking orders running around managing more customers obviously we would have waited. But really if you are chatting and standing there like a lazy bum then who has the patience to wait??Horrible experience she completely spoiled our evening. This place has no ambience poor service and kind of reasonable not great but good food. If you are looking for a nice experience avoid it there are many places in NYC." u'Perfect quick stop for a cozy warm homemade meal on the way to hamilton (4 blocks away). \xa0FYI book of mormon is right next door. \xa0Food came out 10 minutes after we ordered! \xa0 We found out waitress to be very nice and helped us choose our entrees......We will definitely go back!' u"Next to the O'Neil theater and worthy of a visit. \xa0Fantastic bar...great menu with something for everyone. \xa0If you want to eat before the show you can get a full meal before 5:00 (shows start at 7:00). \xa0We had a group of six and it was no problem for the staff. \xa0Fresh food and great service. \xa0This is a must try place in NYC... I know there a many choices but you can't go wrong here." u'We found this restaurant on yelp as we were looking for a dinner before the Broadway show. I believe the restaurant has upstairs and downstairs and we went downstairs. It was a Saturday night and we had no reservations but they were able to sit \xa0us as there were only 2 of us. We were sitted in a small room with wood decor. There were 4 or 5 tables in total in that room and like in any other NYC restaurant the tables and seats were very close to each other. The menu is pretty basic Italian food. When I saw the menu my first thought was \xa0that all the items on the menu can be cooked quickly so everything is probably fresh. And it was the case! We ordered bruschetta for appetizer and pasta carbonara and chicken piccata for dinner. The food was fresh and tasty. Overall I had better and more sophisticated Italian food before but for a Saturday night in a theater district in NYC it was great. Great basic Italian food! Btw my current profile picture was made at Cielo.' u"I brought my mother and grandmother here before going to Radio City. I was looking for somewhere to go that would be quiet enough for conversation and catching up and Cielo delivered on that perfectly. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful as well. I had a question about the sauce of the Penne alla Stefano and she was able to answer immediately and this is what I ended up getting. I also ordered a cocktail the Bee's Knees and was able to order it with whiskey instead of gin (personal preference). The rest of my table ordered pasta dishes as well. The bread basket was foccacia and was more plentiful that we three bread-loving ladies could finish. Our food was brought out quite quickly and based on the empty plates I would say that we all enjoyed our meal thoroughly. Definitely can't beat the quality for the price in the Theater District!" u'Your Staff was great to us ... We came in prior to our show ... The Book of Mormon ... and walked next door in high spirits and ready to enjoy our evening! I even forgot to mention that we came in for Sunday Brunch as the lobby of the Mayfair had the wonderful aroma of breakfast!!!Highly recommend!!!' u"My mother sister grandmother and I dined here in September. We had tickets to the Lion King so we decided to come here for an early dinner.The food was good but nothing fantastic. Standard Italian fare. My sister and I had the Carbonara my grandmother had the gnocchi and my mother had something with olives in it. One nice thing was that they offered a carafe of wine if you didn't want to purchase a bottle. The carafe was the perfect size - about two glasses each." u"My husband and I stumbled upon this restaurant looking for a place for a late dinner. \xa0After we were seated downstairs which by the way was so quaint we were informed of a private party coming in and the manager(?) asked us kindly to move upstairs. \xa0We did and she comped our drinks thank you! I had the Raviloi and the hubs had the gnocchi with meatballs. \xa0We both thoroughly enjoyed out meals! \xa0Luckily we had Paige when we went upstairs and so pleased with her service! \xa0I had just ordered a sour watermelon margarita downstairs but I just couldn't drink it it was that bad. \xa0She happily made me a regular margarita and it was awesome. \xa0So good that I ordered a second one! We ordered the cheesecake and Triamasu for dessert. \xa0OMG! The Triamasu is so soft and delicate like nothing I have had before. \xa0This is one of the great things about NYC there are so many wonderful places to discover and looking at reviews just do not do justice. \xa0You have to experience it for yourself! \xa0We are glad we did and had a wonderful dinner! \xa0Thank you!"]
84.Patzeria Family & Friends,[u"It's been about three days since my visit and I am still nursing my food baby from the deliciously oversized pepperoni and sausage pizza I consumed. Prior to my visit I had been craving quality New York pizza for weeks and based upon previous reviews and some quick Google searches I fell upon this place--and boy am I glad.The atmosphere is an adorable Italian bistro that has exposed brick and Broadway posters scattered throughout. The bar was beautifully lit and a great focal point of the restaurant. As for our service our server was attentive and very charming. I like to think we provided her some humor for the night because when she brought out our large pizza (for only two of us) our jaws hit the ground and eyes bulged out of our heads. I can't say I was upset about the size because I lived off of that pizza for the next day and a half. It was so fresh and hot that I refused to wait for it to cool down before my first bite. We also ordered the calamari which I am now grateful the serving wasn't as big as anticipated because we would have had to been rolled out of the restaurant. Also the garlic bread that they served is so tasty--I had to keep moving it away from me because I almost ate the whole basket myself. I look forward to my next trip to NYC because this will definitely be at the top of my list. I've already recommended this restaurant to a few friends who are currently in NYC so it is my hope that they enjoy it as much as I did. Bravo!" u"Pretty delicious food! Delivery is fast too. The flavor of the food is very home cooked Which is always refreshing. I enjoy the food and order from here regularly. Whether I'm entertaining guests or just want a nice hot meal I always order from here" u'Great Italian food near Times Square! My family and I were looking for dinner after we saw a show last Saturday night. We wanted a place with pizza as well as Italian dishes. We ordered garlic knots for the table and they were delicious! They were served with marinara sauce and they paired perfectly. We also received bread which was very good as well. For dinner I had chicken parmigiana. It was very tender and the perfect portion size. It was served with penne pasta and topped with fresh basil. My Mom had chicken francaise and she loved it! Very tasty and the perfect portion. My dad and brother had personal pizzas and enjoyed them as well. The atmosphere and staff was very welcoming and we had a great experience.' u'We were looking for a place to eat which was near our hotel and that it wasn\'t expensive and good for kids. This place came up on Yelp. It is a NY traditional restaurant which means it is small uncomfortable and has average service.The restaurant has decent pricing for the area the dishes are reasonable portioned and the food tastes good. It isn\'t anything phenomenal to deserve 5 stars but as a "Italian" it is good enough. No garlic overload on sauces but it is still there which kills the authenticity. The lasagna has ricotta cheese so it can\'t be called lasagna either. It isn\'t Italian but it isn\'t your traditional American Italian as you can\'t taste the garlic and the tomato sauce seems to be homemade rather than out of a can.The restaurant doesn\'t have A/C so it is really hot inside. The service is horribly slow and the usual NY rudeness is there for most of the employees.' u"Great Italian place close to Times Square that isn't super expensive. Nice BIG portions great fresh ingredients great pizza crust and red sauce." u"Glad I bookmarked this one before our trip to NYC! After a brief wait (not bad 10 min) we were seated towards the back of the restaurant. It's a small place so be prepared to squeeze by some people on your way to the table (but it's NYC and space is limited everywhere). We ordered the barrata special and I got the tortellini while my boyfriend ordered the lasagna. Loved the garlic bread that we got at the same time as our drinks. My tortellini was great. So nice to come back to the northeast and indulge in some awesome Italian food (Atlanta just isn't up to par). The lasagna was inhaled by my boyfriend not one piece was left on his plate.Great overall dinner fairly priced for the amount of food and the area ($72 for both entrees one appetizer and 3 glasses of wine- suggestion: you might need to add a few ice cubes if you order red wine...it was warm). Definitely a good stop while you're in Hell's Kitchen." u"I *almost* gave this place only 3 stars but then I had their Risotto Scampi...! Of course this is a smaller location because well... it's NYC. We were a large party and called ahead to make reservations. Unfortunately upon arriving one of our tables was not yet ready. We were told to make our way back towards the other part of our group to mingle but then a quite rude staff member decided he was bothered with us taking up the limited aisleways. I definitely understand that the gentleman needs to continue serving the other customers and bussing tables but I felt that there was a nicer way to ask us to move than just basically telling us we were in the way. Once we were seated we ordered wine baked clams Caprese salad meatballs and fried calamari. I did try the clams Caprese and meatballs. The Caprese was as expected although I usually eat mine with balsamic vinegar on it whereas they had a side of Italian dressing to pour over. The baked clams seemed overdone to me but I have only had them one other time at a restaurant. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be cooked. The meatballs were.... just okay. I hate to say it but I felt as though they were undercooked a bit and could have used a more dynamic flavor to really suck me in as a fan. The server brought us garlic bread which was delicious!We then ordered a large cheese pizza to share with the table and one entree each. I ordered the Risotto Scampi which was on the daily specials and consisted of risotto (duh) scallops and shrimp. Oh my goodness! It was so yummy and my fellow diners kept taking bites of the risotto because they couldn't stay away from how delicious it was. The pizza was alright considering we only ordered cheese. I do love a good pizza so for me it was only 3-stars.Our waitress was fantastic! She never missed a beat and provided excellent service to us. The owner/manager was also present and he was lively and welcoming. Other than the perturbed busboy we had zero complaints about the staff. I would definitely recommend this as an option to friends and family visiting the City." u'Loved it!Great pasta and pizza in a nice casual setting. Not pretentious and very sincere.Would definitely go here again.' u"We walked past this place and decided to try it because it was near the hotel and the prices were good. \xa0We had the spaghetti Bolognese which is my wife's eternal favorite food and the ravioli. \xa0The service was good. \xa0They brought garlic bread and water right out. \xa0My wife says the spaghetti was exactly what she expected a Bolognese to be so she's very happy. \xa0The ravioli was good. \xa0Perhaps the food wasn't earth shattering but it was good. \xa0The service was good. \xa0The ambience was good. \xa0The best part was that this was the first place where the prices were not astronomical." u"I had dinner here for my birthday and it was amazing! It was my first time in New York and I found this place on Yelp. I decided to give it a try. I order the lasagna and it was to die for!! It was so good that we came back the next day to try their pizza and that was amazing as well. Very good food and very good customer service. The portions are huge! I wish there was a place like this in California! I will definitely stop by this place next time I'm in the city!" u"Perfect for pre/post theater dinner. If your looking for a casual atmosphere with excellent yet reasonably priced Italian food Patzeria is a must! \xa0 \xa0Finding a good restaurant in midtown West can be tricky especially if you're looking for good quality food without the touristy feel. \xa0Patzeria is a cozy yet comfortable Italian restaurant offering a wide menu selection from pizza to pasta that caters to all. \xa0Service: \xa0The service was excellent. \xa0Usually I order delivery this was the first time actually eating at the restaurant. \xa0My friends and I sat at the bar and had a wonderful time. \xa0The bartender Julie was superb! \xa0My friends are a bit indecisive when it comes to ordering anything. \xa0Julie was patient and recommended the perfect wine based on each of our individual preferences. \xa0She also answered all of their questions related to the menu. \xa0Even though every seat at the bar was packed Julie did an unbelievable job checking on each person ensuring that everyone was content and happy. \xa0Thank you Julie you're a STAR! \xa0Ambiance: \xa0Cozy yet comfortable. \xa0 If you do not have a reservation get there early! \xa0The place gets packed! \xa0I was impressed with how accommodating staff was to seat a group of 2 and even 10. \xa0There was a line waiting outside the door for the majority of the night however the staff did a really good job at turning over the tables making the wait time seem reasonable. Food: \xa0All of the food is excellent however I do have my favorites. \xa0Patzeria has the best chicken francese in the area it's lightly breaded with just the right amount of sauce. \xa0Skip the vegetables and pay extra for the pasta it's totally worth it. \xa0The NY Steak Hero is also a must. \xa0The bread is perfect and can actually hold the meat which is cooked to your preferred temperature. \xa0Portions are large but not excessively large. \xa0Prices are very reasonable." u'This place was great! After getting out of a comedy show and craving Italian food on a Saturday night this place was perfect. Staff was friendly and attentive (it helped that there were only a handful of people in the restaurant) They were accommodating when we stumbled in after several rounds of drinks at the comedy show and requested to sit outside. We ordered a pitcher of the white sangria which was delicious refreshing and came with big chunks of fruit in it! As an appetizer we ordered the calamari which were crunchy golden brown and amazing! I ordered the cheese ravioli which came with a generous portion of ravioli and smothered in red sauce! Out waitress was super friendly and helpful when we were asking for recommendations and suggestions. The waiter who stood by the door was friendly funny and kept us entertained while we ate our dinner. Their patio was cute clean and great for people watching on a Saturday night in NYC :)This may not be the best Italian food in NYC but the environment staff location and food was amazing and just what we were looking for!' u"Came here at 12noon on a Friday afternoon and I was the only one dining. Don't let that put you off. It picked up around 1230zWaitress was friendly and wasn't rushing to take my order. She even asked me if I wanted to choose a channel on the TV! There's a cheap $10.99 lunch menu where you get a soda included which is great value.I ordered the Penne bolognese. Pretty small portion but plenty enough for lunch (you'd want more for dinner). The flavour was unexpectedly good for such a cheap price. The sauce was incredibly flavourful. The penne was cooked to absolute perfection. Very simple but incredibly satisfying.Service came out promptly (but not suspiciously quick as if it was waiting already in the back). Very impressive for just your usual poke in the wall Italian restaurant. Would come back again to explore the menu." u"My colleague and I were in town for an event. \xa0We wanted to have a nice meal and my colleague wanted Lasagna. \xa0Most of the reviews said this was the place for great Lasagna. \xa0We were seated right on time for our reservation. \xa0We had a few cocktails and ordered the mussels as an appetizer. \xa0They were delicious. \xa0We used the bread they provided to soak up the sauce trying to avoid licking the bowl. \xa0I ordered the special Lobster Ravioli and as expected my colleague had the lasagna. \xa0Both were phenomenal. \xa0The service was fast as well. \xa0I love Tiramisu so I had to try theirs. \xa0It definitely ranks in the top 5 I've had. \xa0All around this place was perfect. \xa0What's better...casual atmosphere you don't have to dress up and if you want Pizza our table neighbors said theirs was fantastic. \xa0Either way you cannot go wrong eating here!!!" u'When in NY pizza is a "must have"...right? But with so many great places to choose we finally decided on PATZERIA. \xa0 It was the right choice. Family owned this quaint spot offered up everything that this hungry tourist from Alaska could want. We opted to sit at the bar. \xa0Not \xa0only was the dining room packed there was a line quickly getting longer. We have had good luck with bar service while here. We have found our bartenders to be gracious and funny. Julie did not disappoint. \xa0 We decided to share the Neopolitan pizza with sausage black olives and garlic along with the Tortellini Patzeria. The pizza was great. Perfect \xa0crust and lots of cheese. The Tortelini was the best I\'ve ever had! What \xa0makes this place so good and deserving of five stars is the laid back family atmosphere and friendly staff. We loved Julie. Not only was she a great server...she was the bartender for the whole place. She never skipped a beat. She effortlessly (or so it seemed to me) kept up with the endless drink orders from the dining room while she attended to our needs and the rest of the guests at the bar. We very much enjoyed the entire experience. Good food good atmosphere and good service with a smile...with a few jokes thrown in as well. Drop by and enjoy! We thoroughly did.' u"It's good and reasonable.Good for family." u'For breakfast?Yes indeed!!Beats the "Times Square Diner & Grill" hands down!Everything was good the staff was attentive and not rude and it\'s a very comfortable place. If your looking for a good breakfast experience and being "trendy" isn\'t paramount - eat here.....and be happy.' u"This is a comfortable-feeling restaurant. \xa0The space is well worn with pretty tight quarters -- you'll have to work to stay out of the conversations at nearby tables (since they're close enough to be connected to yours). \xa0The staff is warm and friendly and makes you feel at home.The food portions are large -- I guess they could be large enough to share if you aren't greedy around pasta like I am. \xa0I was disappointed by the food though or at least by what I ordered. \xa0I found the meat ravioli to be surprisingly flavorless both the pasta and the filling; the tomato sauce was wonderful however as was my friend's chicken marsala. \xa0Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing?" u"We stumbled on this place one evening and everything was perfect from the very start! We were (very warmly) welcomed and seated and given great attention! The food is absolutely amazing- I'm a fan of Italian and this by far was my favorite pasta in the city! The portions are pretty large and a pasta plate can be easily shared by two people. A friend of mine tried the pizza and said it was pretty great too!" u"It was my first time visiting NY and even though I was on a diet (I know who goes on a diet during vacation?) I really wanted to find a place with authentic delicious New York pizza. After all what's the point in coming to New York if you don't eat pizza am I right? After a long while of yelp-ing I settled on Patzeria and I am so happy I did. We started off with the free garlic bread which was the bomb. I'm a simple girl. I love bread and butter but what's even better is when there's garlic on it. I saw the massive pizzas at the other tables and thought I better stop after 2 pieces of bread before I don't have any room left for pizza. My family of 5 ordered 2 large pizzas. These babies were huge. Our waiter kindly told us that 2 large pizzas may be a bit too much for our mere family of 5 but he's never met my family. We ordered the tomato basil and mozzarella and we also decided to do a sausage ham and mushroom. Both were delicious. I am a fan New York pizza and I would come back just for you. I love that the pizza crust isn't so overwhelming and the sauce cheese and toppings blend well together. Sausage is my favorite pizza topping and Patzeria has great sausage! Yum. I ate 3 large slices myself and I was ridiculously full afterwards. But no regrets! It was so worth it."]
168.The Jones,[u'Thought it was weird this place was empty when I went in because it is SO inviting but it was definitely just an off night because every other time I walked by it was completely packed.The interior is so clean with a fresh design and plays great music. It has a nice size bar and huge open windows so you can enjoy the pleasantry of sitting inside while still feeing that NYC sidewalk energy. FOOD: I started with the "Burnt Brussels Sprout" which were really good - I will admit they were a different taste at first compared to the usual roasted Brussels you get everywhere else but I think they are a hit. Definitely sharing portions. For my mail I had the glazed BBQ salmon which was so good I ate it really fast and forgot to document :) the snow pea risotto under it is AMAZING and ties the whole dish together.This place is hip the service is great and would be great for date night girls night or whatever night you want! Cocktails looks fab too! GRADE A!' u'It\'s the first time I had gramosa so i could not compare it with others. It tasted like fresh squeezed grapefruit  not that great compared to mimosa. For $10 You get 6oz in small glass wine with no garnish whatsoever. \xa0I ordered Adobe salad. You can see the description on the menu photo I posted. The description makes it sound tasty but the salad is just a mere iceberg  carrots  red cabbage like the ones you would get off -the -shelf supermarket Dole salad mix. It was topped with supposedly grilled chicken \xa0but in reality it tasted like frozen pre -cooked chicken that tasted like cardboard. The black beans was not enough probably my guess was less than 1/4 cup. And they topped it with tortilla. \xa0The dressing was on the sweet side. \xa0I was expecting it to have some lime or cilantro because it\'s a southwest theme salad as the name says. \xa0I got a to go frittata for someone and the comment for that was "it was so good! Of course I didn\'t get to taste it but one of my friend ordered it also and she said it was really good and she finished 90% of her meal.Another person ordered the quinoa bowl and finished almost all of it .' u'I went here with some friends to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a Sunday night. It was a bit early (around 6pm) so the place was pretty empty and we were able to be seated right away. The space is not too large but it has a unique aesthetic that I enjoyed.For my meal I decided to go with the red curry roasted chicken breast. Though I enjoyed the overall flavor of the dish I felt that it was a little bit underwhelming. First off the portion was a bit small especially with the $17.50 price tag. In addition the chicken was decent but did not blow me away--the curry sauce definitely helped to heighten the flavor but there was not nearly enough of it on the plate. The roti pancake was probably my favorite part of the dish but it felt like a completely random entity on the plate. Finally for that price tag I would expect the chef to be a bit more adventurous with the bok choy than just steaming it.Overall this place is a cute casual spot to grab a bite to eat but was a bit underwhelming to me. There is definitely some potential as the menu reads well but there is still a bit of work to be done to compete with some of the other food spots in the area.' u'Yum! Perfect end to our NYC week! The Bloody Mary and Ginger Peach Bellini were the best and the donut bites were heaven.' u"We really enjoyed happy hour/early dinner at The Jones. \xa0We arrived pretty early on a Friday during happy hour and enjoyed the buy one get one free drink special and the $5 appetizer items. \xa0We especially enjoyed the Asian chicken salad and the hummus on the happy hour menu--while supposedly smaller portions they were perfect for $5! \xa0The Asian chicken salad was served in a cute to-go box with chopsticks. \xa0We also ordered the chicken and waffles off of the regular menu and while good I didn't love that item as much as the Asian chicken salad and hummus. \xa0And great service!" u"Came here with a girlfriend before watching One Funny Mother at New World Stages. We popped in randomly without having planned on eating here. It was an okay choice - I wasn't severely disappointed but I wasn't very excited about the food overall.The space was almost empty when we got there since it was still relatively early (around 5:45-6) although it started to fill up by the time we left. We each had a cocktail; I enjoyed mine the Avenue. It had some fruity flavor without it being overly sweet.We shared the pearled barley risotto burnt Brussels sprouts and that evening's appetizer special: ceviche with scallops.The burnt Brussels sprouts held true to their name; they were truly burnt. I was hoping that there would be some actual intact Brussels spouts showing through but no. It wasn't their fault since that's the way the dish is supposed to be but neither of us quite enjoyed this and didn't even finish it. It was also way too salty for my liking.The scallops in the ceviche felt very mushy and did not taste fresh. I liked the other parts of the dish (crispy chip/tortilla on the bottom avocado mango) but the scallops tasted very fishy and I was not pleased with the overall taste. If we kept picking at it it was more out of obligation.Thankfully the pearled barley risotto was delicious! Both of us agreed that this was the one that we liked. It had both great texture and flavor; I wish we had ordered more of this and didn't order one of the other dishes.Service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.Overall: this place left me wanting better. It wasn't a terrible meal but I'll probably try another place next time I'm in the area." u"Cute. Popped by early on a Friday lured in by the buy-one-get-one cocktail special. The place is clean and cute albeit totally empty when I was there so I can't speak for the vibe. Bartender \xa0as friendly and the jalapeno infused tequila was tasty. Overall fine placebut didn't really blow my socks off." u'Rough on the service. cool atmosphere. consider this for an upscale delivery option.' u"Have to admit this place has charm. Small but polished. I ordered the kale and burrata salad with chicken which was great and large. Very fresh. The downfall: this place is all brick on top of blasting music you very quickly get a headache and must talk louder to over come the echoing sound. Two: prices for liquor are very expensive. A shot of knob creek for my coffee was $14 dollars. That's the same price for a martini in midtown east With top shelf. So basically I had 21 dollar coffee because of the whiskey shot. A bit insane." u'This is a true hidden gem on the west side! The prices are great and the food is even better. Must try the chicken & waffle appetizer! \xa0A very comfortable dining room awesome music playing and the cocktails are mainly house infusions so creative! Check it out!' u"I'm so glad that the Jones carries on the same delicious vibe as The Eatery had. The food DE-effing-LICIOUS! The cocktails infused and On Point!!!! The service is impeccable!!! JC the bartender is professional funny and personable. I couldn't have had a better experience anywhere in NYC. Yum and done." u"Hands down absolutely fantastic. Every bite was on point. Our meal included the Tomato Soup as a starter (order extra croutons bc they're awesome) Mahi Mahi tacos Red Curry Chicken and the Burnt Brussel Sprouts (incredible). For dessert the croissant bread pudding A La Mode (order extra ice cream) and oh my lord was an awesome ending to our meal!Yahj was our server and made the highly recommended food suggestions that we approved on. He was so pleasant and very easy going.Overall the experience was amazing and the atmosphere is intimate casual. Everyone there was enjoying themselves and their meal. They deserve an A+ 5 Star review" u"Came here for dinner on a Friday night. The service was really outstanding with a very attentive and sweet wait staff. The food... Was really bad. I had the salmon salad and Brussels sprouts. Both were over cooked and pretty flavorless. I'm not even picky... I'd come back but only to give brunch a shot." u"Sat at the counter for brunch today.Watched the guy behind the counter sneeze into his hands run his hands through his hair and wipe his mouth with his hands repeatedly as he filled glasses used his hands to put olives and other garnishes in drinks and hand us water. \xa0It was gross.Also the food was mediocre it took an inordinate amount of time to get served and we weren't given a table because they were all reserved...but by the time we left (over an hour later) the supposedly-reserved tables were still empty.There are soooooooo many better places to eat in Hell's Kitchen." u"Summary: a New American restaurant that's worth a try in the competitive Hell's Kitchen area. But service and food are nothing spectacular to write home about.Venue: in case you're not aware Hell's Kitchen is more than just home to Daredevil. Its variety of food is a blessing to the locals. The Jones just opened up few weeks ago (as of the time of this writing). The inside has a nice mix of modern and rustic look. It has a bar and about 10 single tables so it's not a huge place. We came here for brunch so not sure how it looks at night. Food: what's unique about the menu is that they change it everyday. And it's only a page so you're not bombarded with too many choices. Its mix of fusion food is quite interesting. I had the Korean BBQ Chicken Omelette while my friend has the Stuffed Croissant French Toast. My omelette looks unique but it's nothing more than regular omelette with chicken and Korean kimchi sauce. The french toast was slightly better but still not amazing. The only thing I liked was the maple-bacon sausage which was quite good.Service: They really fall short in this department. There was only 2 of us and when we got there there's a clean empty table open as well as chairs by the bar but we were standing there waiting to be seated for at least 20 mins (with no one else waiting). We were told by the waitress twice that someone would come greet us so we didn't want to just walk in and sit down. Finally the person who greeted us looks like the owner or manager but in plain clothes that you'd think he's just a customer. Even after we were seated the service was still slow. In fact the couple who were sitting next to us got up and just left without ordering. Without service any restaurant would just look like a take-out place.Overall I'm not impressed with the food or the service at all and neither is my friend. We both feel there's potential but just not enough to justify another visit.**Note - it seems most of the 5 star reviews were written by people with 1 or 2 reviews.. kinda suspicious.**" u'I was so disappointed when Eatery (the predecessor to this restaurant) closed. I had high hopes that The Jones would be of the same quality - it is not. The menu lacks variety and the waitstaff is ill-informed about dietary restrictions (which is surprising considering Eatery was so accommodating to gluten-free customers). The food itself is good but nothing special. Not somewhere I see myself returning to despite living down the street. Many better options on this stretch of 9th Ave' u'Consistently awesome! I live pretty close by and order through seamless every now and again. Today I saw a new menu item the waffle chicken sandwich. After ordering it I got a call saying that it was a new brunch item that was accidentally placed on the seamless diner menu and that I was the first customer to try it. They wanted feedback. \xa0Omfg order it now! It\'s like if a chick-fil-a sandwich had a baby with a Mcgriddle then that baby sandwich was eaten by a Michelin rated chef who totally forgot about the experience until about a week ago when he was stoned with his buddies and said "yo Bruh...Bruh im about to blow your mind with a sandwich are you ready?!?" Then he went into his kitchen and whatever religious figure you do or don\'t believe In reached down from the heavens and touched his soul as he put together the greatest waffle chicken sandwich I\'ve ever had. \xa0Also the vanilla bean cheesecake was pretty good.' u'Friendly bartender. Good beer. Cocktails were tasty but on the weak side. Had the mess cal the conquistador cocktails.' u"As others I used to love Eatery. This place is loud and tiny but nicely decorated. Luckily we were able to get a table there are only a few and when we left there was a short line.We came for brunch and loved the menu. Very interesting.I had the Korean bbq chicken omelette with kimchi cabbage slaw and edamame . ( I told you it was an interesting menu.) It was quite good.My husband had the croissant sandwich with home made maple sausage egg cheese and spicy ketchup. He enjoyed it as well.The service was good. I'm just afraid if we return we won't get seated. Eatery was a large space and unfortunately this is too small" u'LOVE this place. Grab a drink at the bar (Hint hint: The Importance of Being Ernest) and chill with some friends and the great staff.']
36.Riposo 46,[u'Brunch! Sold to me by my friend who said it\'s the best eggs benedict in midtown (she also claims Manhattan but hasn\'t done enough research to claim that far). So we both had the Sicilian Benedict that comes "Prosciutto di Parma arugula mozzarella & hollandaise."She didn\'t oversell! The were delicious with so many flavors working together. The hollandaise was just the perfect amount of creamy and salty. The plate is stacked high so it\'s good \xa0they have a thick knife to cut all the way through. It\'s $15 but if you are going to go for an occasional nice brunch it\'s decent price for it.Now it wasn\'t my first time trying to eat here but it seems to get packed easily since it\'s such a small spot so I\'d come up with a Plan B if I was going to come here. Also the benedict comes with some fruit but the hollandaise sauce got on it. I\'d really prefer the fruit to not touch the egg juice. Other than that a great meal for brunch.' u"We are here for brunch. The flatbread on the menu is actually a huge pizza. Super thin which is great. It's okay tasting. If you wanna a twist of regular pizza you can try this place." u'Loved this spot! Cozy cute and great wine selection. My friend and I had a fabulous sparkling rose arugula salad and mushroom crostini to split. Service was very friendly but never felt like we were rushed. Yelp offers a good deal of 30% off a bottle of wine if you spend a certain amount on food. The experience overall was great and I would definitely return.' u"This restaurant is just small but gosh I went for brunch and it was the best Sunday brunch of my life in the Hell's kitchen area! Food has quality and great presentation. A must go if you are in midtown." u"Walked in on a quiet... No let me rephrase walked in on a dead memorial Monday- wanted a window seat and was told the seat is for food not just drinks.... Minus 2 stars for assuming I was not going to order food. Ordered a Malbec and a steak arugula salad- medium. Older male- grey hair clearly didn't hear me. Steak arrived well- smothered- doused and overly covered in percorino cheese. The amount of steak for the money isn't worth it. Minus another star. And the toasted bread under the salad was so hard- my gums almost bled. One time deal- wouldn't recommend based on first impressions - good job! Shame on old man who later denied being the owner. Lousy service- Too many other wine bars near by!" u'Great wine bar lovely menu of bites to eat with amazing selection of wines. \xa0Not so good for a group but nice for 2-4 in a group. Cozy venue. \xa0Staff is very friendly and bar staff good to chat with while having a drink.' u"I opted to try out this place for my birthday brunch on a Saturday afternoon. I didn't really know what to expect but 9th Avenue has never let me down food-wise. This place was no different. We were greeted instantly by the waitress/bartender who was very attentive and encouraged us to try certain food items and what brunch drinks they had on special (bloody marys and mimosas). I went with a bloody mary (kind of weak) and Riposo Ranchero. The Ranchero dish was really really good. The tortilla flats were crispy the salsa super spicy and I liked how the egg was more cooked than other similar dishes I have had. I wish I could give this place 3.5 starts. The service and food were amazing but the brunch drinks we very weak. I will be coming back for the wine though. I mean it's a wine bar! I need to see if I can get this place up to 4 stars." u'Our server Billy was super friendly  helpful and honest about the menu. \xa0They had a special with a glass of wine and margherita flatbread for $19! \xa0It was delicious / fresh Ingredients and large enough to share. The arugula salad with grapefruit accompanied everything well. Great wine selection and Yelpers enjoy 30% off bottles - why not Yelp! \xa0Small - quaint - locals among all!' u"Came here at around 12:30 on a Sunday and found it pleasantly quiet and not crowded. (Maybe the heat today kept people away.) There are only about 3 tables and the rest is bar seating. Small but cozy. Good for 4 people and under. It was great being able to have a regular indoor-voice conversation. Server was really nice and attentive. Water was always filled. We got mixed berry pancakes and brioche French toast with a side of chicken apple sausages. Food was decently yummy at typical NYC brunch prices. Enjoyed the sausages! But a bit pricey for one sausage. Also French toast came with too much syrup and it felt like eating a soaked sponge of cavities. The parts that weren't drenched in syrup were tasty though.Overall a good brunch experience. Given its proximity to the crib would probably come back and try out the savory options!" u"Delightfully quaint this wine bar serves a great selection of wines I haven't heard of before - which is great because I love trying and discovering new wines! Charming service from a waitress who I actually don't mind calling me little pet names :)We only had their little meats and cheese platter but it was the perfect compliment to our wine. They were serving amazing flat bread pizzas around us and I can't wait to come back and try that one day. Overall a solid place to meet friends or pre-dinner drinks. Dim lights and high bar stools also give it an air of romance and I'll definitely be back for more of the new wines I fell in love with!" u"We live in the neighborhood and found this gem about a year ago. We only go on the weekends early Saturday's or Sunday's. Order the eggs Benedict or the Sicilian eggs Benedict! They have $5 mimosas and the service is always exceptional. They don't have cream for coffee only milk. This is a smallPlace but we have never experienced a long wait time. Great for a good price for food and drinks!" u'We had a fun light dinner on Saturday January 16 2016. We read reviews that told us that the cheese plate was not to be missed and they were right! \xa04 types of cheese toasted baguette bread grapes figs and dates - so yummy. We then had a chocolate cake for dessert - so decadent and it paired beautifully with the port. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that the wine list was a little disappointing. I could have purchased the wines at my local package store. The staff was nice. We sat at the bar but did not interact much with other patrons who all seemed to be on dates and not wanting to chat with us - even though we tried.' u'This place is really cute. \xa0Not very big so perfect for 2 people. Came here for dinner with a friend. \xa0All the small tables were filled so we selected a great spot at the bar. \xa0Very friendly service. \xa0Our food was out lightening fast. \xa0 Great wine selection. \xa0We had the Prosciutto di Parma: \xa0Yummmmm this was incredible! \xa0The best pizza by far everyone around us seemed to agree as half the restaurant seemed to of ordered the same thing. We also had a nice fresh caprice salad --huge slices of mozzarella.' u'Delicious Super Tuscan Malbec and the best one was the Pinto Noir. Great portions for all the dishes and the steak bruschetta was very good. We sat at the bar on a Monday and Happy Hour was all night which is 20% off of wines and flatbreads. The staff was friendly and we had an excellent time.' u'LOVED THIS LITTLE BAR!! Very romantic feeling! I would highly suggest this for a date night. Attire if either dressy or casual. Bartender (lady) is friendly.' u'Great place ! Cozy great Prosecco and food fantastic music (mainly 80\xb4s which is my favourite :)) and amazing staff ! Super friendly ! This is definitely my new favourite bar in NYC ! Looking forward to be back !' u"The steak bruschetta was really yums. Huge fan of the arugula base and yummy toasted bread they put together. I would have liked it to be cut into more portions as the cutting process at the table got a little messy but it was otherwise divine. The mussels were also great. We were basically spooning up the broth at the end. Great service as well so I'm definitely coming back." u"After a terrible experience at a nearby restaurant we were feeling deflated. I was will to give up on the evening and just go home for delivery but was talked into trying this place nearby. Riposo 46 completely turned our evening around.The server wasn't able to seat us right away but the place is small and we decided to just dine along their back wall anyway -- it was basically the same as sitting at a table and we were hungry.When I asked the difference between two wines our waitress (she was amazing - working on 6/11/15 in the evening) offered to let me try a sip of each. They were both great and she served a big pour after I decided.Their flatbread was basically a pizza -- a very good pizza. We ordered the Sweet Italian Sausage flatbread (tomatoes broccoli rabe mozzarella chili flakes Parmesan) which we LOVED and ordered another of to enjoy a bit more and take home the rest for the next day.Throughout the service here was exceptional the environment was intimate but lively. the flatbread was delicious and I loved my wine.I would absolutely return to this location and am eager to try their Upper West Side spot closer to my home.Thank you for saving our evening Riposo 46!" u"Living in Northern California has made me a wine bar snob. Riposo 46 doesn't have anything bad going on it just doesn't have anything amazing going on. The wine list was small but represented all the major varietals you might hope for and also some good sounding blends. I'd have liked to see some more options though like more than one cab or syrah to choose from." u'I did not like this place.I had the misfortune of having "Billy" as my bartender. This meant him ignoring \xa0everyone else at the bar except his friends. And there were a whole lot of them. Well shit if I was having preferential treatment over strangers I would show up too! And I found it extra rude that he asked every man who showed up alone if he had company joining him later. But when I came around a single woman he just threw the menus at me. I mean at least pretend I have a hot date and don\'t look like a spinster! I won\'t be coming back. I would rather drink Barefoot riesling and eat frozen pizza alone in my apartment. Oh well more room at the bar for Billy\'s friends.']
71.Mooncake Foods,[u"They deliver! The food was probably some of the best delivery foods I've ever ordered. I had the fish tacos and they come unassembled. The (white) fish is cooke and in one to-go box and the greens and tortillas come in another so it's not soggy when you get them. I just made mine into a taco salad and threw bits of tortilla into it. So delicious! My friend ordered the tuna burger and he said it was fresh and the tuna/wasabi mayo combo was perfect--not too much sauce or too little. It was Goldilocks. He also said it wasn't fishy at all and the buns were nice and fluffy." u"I ordered via delivery.Im giving it a 1 star for the sake they failed to mention the added miso paste and sesame on the broiled salmon salad. My friend had food allergy to sesame. If we knew it was not simply broiled we could've gotten him suitable food. \xa0Not to mention we also asked for dressing on the side which was not. This is one meal WASTED. \xa0Outside of the almost killing my friend...the food was great and got delivered under the estimated time. I would recommend the steak plate." u'The name itself is cute and catchy; it was one of those nights I wanted snacks but not meals per say so I stopped in here for some Vietnamese spring rolls. The shop is little and dingy but that adds a casual ambiance to it. Their spring rolls are pretty good and cheap as well; $5. This place is perfect for Vietnamese small eats.' u'I ordered the tofu bahn mi and it came with a side salad and ginger dressing. I loved what they were shooting to achieve of the bahn mi as well as the stuffing but it had no flavor. It came with a green sauce and I used all of it. Cash only. The service was fast!' u"Ordered food for delivery. It arrived nearly 2 hours later and so cold you'd think I'd taken it from a refrigerator. This was especially odd considering it's July in New York and not even cold outside...Won't be ordering again and I'd advise if you do order from them do it 2 hours before you plan on eating. Also order something served cold." u"Worst service ever. I sat there for ten minutes while the there was no other client and I didn't get the menu water or anything else. There were four of the staff working at the restaurant at that time. Finally one of them came to my table and explained something in Chinese which from his hand gestures I figured that they don't have food today. So from the service they don't deserve the average rating on Yelp. If you want food don't go to this place." u"Mooncake how I love thee. Your menu is innovative. Your ingredients are fresh. I only wish this location was a bit bigger since you're so popular but I appreciate how quickly you make your food to help get us in and out quickly without feeling rushed. This restaurant is truly a reliable delicious spot in this part of the city.Everything I've had here is tasty. Some favorites include the peashoot dumplings (steamed and green) to share Vietnamese Pork Meatball Hero (with ample pickled veggies daikon and chili sauce) and the steak with Chimichurri. Prices are competitive for the amount of food you get and the quality of the ingredients. Mooncake is playful with their dishes while staying true to their Asian roots.Don't forget to snag the $3 Sapporo draft.Cash only." u"I've been eating a lot of Mooncake Foods lately due to its variety of choices. \xa0You can have either a heavy-ish lunch or a light lunch here depending on your mood. \xa0It's kind of a fusion place but it's not stupid fusion where they try to make creative things that turn out to be gross. \xa0Mooncake foods has fresh and healthy food and you don't leave feeling like you need to go to the gym.Most plates and salads are $10.95 which could be a bit steep for some for lunch but you usually get a decent amount of food. \xa0The restaurant is also clean cool and airy and does not smell greasy.I've had the octopus and spinach noodle a couple times - this is a good option for a light lunch that packs flavor. \xa0Note that this dish is a COLD dish and comes with plenty of chewy octopus! \xa0The spinach noodles are delicious and the perfect consistency and lay atop a bed of greens. \xa0The sauce is a bit pungent so might not be good for those that don't do well with tangy/fishy/sour. \xa0Kind of reminds me of Vietnamese peanut sauce.I've also had the seared tuna salad - the sauce they put on the salad is very very strong and sour but it goes well with the greens and tuna. \xa0Tuna is decently fresh and seared nicely. \xa0I ordered this for delivery but I imagine it probably tastes even better when eaten at the restaurant.The bf has had the salmon plate as well as the short ribs and liked both. \xa0The short ribs looked especially delicious.The lime rickey is a nice refreshing drink with fresh muddled mint but beware as it is quite a sweet drink.Great option for lunch!" u'It\'s almost impossible for me to go into Mooncake Foods "cold" to evaluate it. \xa0I\'ve already enjoyed food at their other two locations in Manhattan so I was already predisposed to enjoying this restaurant.Blink and you\'ll miss walking by the small storefront of this restaurant. \xa0In heavy contrast to its sibling restaurants this one is a medium sized establishment that could probably seat about 20 people tops (and even then rather tightly). \xa0It\'s not as tiny as the one downtown but not as big as the one in the 30\'s. \xa0 The seating is comfortable and you get a full view of the kitchen from several of the seats. \xa0I confess I decided to be boring and ordered items that I knew I loved already. \xa0This included the amazing chicken wings (still stellar after all these years) and the octopus salad (it never fails to amaze). \xa0Our service was really quick though to be fair we were only one of three tables there that night.This is a great spot for a modern take on Asian food. \xa0It doesn\'t look super fancy but I like that. \xa0It\'s comfortable clean and pleasant. \xa0Take note: this place is cash only so be sure to hit the ATM before visiting!' u'Okay the place is literally a whole in the wall and the prep is consistent in the very open yet uber small kitchen that usual only has two folk at a time yet they somehow make due and nothing is fried or traditional and I love that......I randomly came upon them exploring the digs of my new work neighborhood.Their ribs and lobster mango summer rolls are my favs. And the overall portions are decent and proper for sure. At some point would like too do a sit down here for the full experience.' u"Great place in Hell's Kitchen to get a healthy cheap sit down dinner. Gluten free and vegetarian options are abundant. Dinner plates comes with rice (brown or white) and a big side salad. Miso salmon is my personal fave very reminiscent of a home cooked meal. Staff is super chill with a surprisingly extensive beer list." u"Note this place is cash only.Met a friend here around 6:30pm on a Tuesday. I was a little nervous that there wouldn't be seating but it seemed like only 2 of the about 20 seats were occupied on the time. We ordered 2 appetizers (dumplings and Vietnamese spring rolls) and 2 entrees (salmon and ribs). We paid $21 each. Enjoyed this spot would come back again." u"So good! Fresh and delicious. Found it while on vacation and just had to return the following day. The won ton soup and Vietnamese Summer Rolls are great. I didn't try anything else but noticed the sandwich being eaten nearby also looked good. Staff is friendly facility is clean and prices are very reasonable. \xa0Place is very small and is CASH ONLY." u'Writing this review about an order I placed last week. \xa0I ordered wonton soup to my office around 12:15pm and received an email confirming that my order would arrive by no later at 1:35pm. At 1:40 I called the restaurant and was told that the delivery man had "just left" and would be there soon even though by this time we were already past the delivery window. I called Mooncake Foods back at 2:25 (45 minutes after my first call) only for my call to go unanswered. \xa0They apparently don\'t even have an answering machine becasue the phone rang until I hung up. Finally my food arrived at 2:26 (which is one hour later than estimated when my order was confirmed) and to my dismay there was a piece of clear plastic in one of the dumplings (EW). I emailed seamless re: this order and was told that the restaurant refused to acknowledge any of these issues plastic in my food included. \xa0Super unprofessional who doesn\'t answer phone in an NYC (or any) restaurant? \xa0Will absolutely not be ordering again.' u"Really really small place lacking in decor but pretty good food. Ordered the steak with ginger sauce. The ginger sauce was BOMB!!! Can I order a bottle of that to go please? But the steak was overcooked. Presentation was bad. Atmosphere was very Chinatown. Didn't feel like I was in NYC at all (which for some may be a godo thing but for me was not). Also had an octopus noodle dish to-go once and it was pretty bad." u'My friends and I were around the area looking for a place for dinner after happy hour. We stumbled upon this place as per research on Yelp. This little cozy eatery consisted of 6 tables .. could probably fit no more than 12 people. Luckily when we went there were no one there except us. Most of us ordered:Crawfish and dumpling noodle soupMiso glazed salmonSliced steakCurry chicken stewGrilled chicken. All were so delicious! Friendly staff also!' u"Really great spot. Had a hard time trying to decide what to order since so many dishes looked so good! My friend and I ended up sharing the tofu kebabs as well as the shrimp and rice noodle salad. Both were excellent. Fresh healthy not too heavily dressed or sauced essentially everything I enjoy in a simple fresh healthy meal. Left full but not stuffed light and able to keep going for hours not feeling hungry or too full. A great balance and also they give really good fair portion sizes. We must have gone on a Saturday night that was the exception to the rule because it was not so crowded; but it's small so I can see how easily it could be. Go there. You will love it." u'Steak and Roasted Peppers Hero! The flavors are just too good. Especially with the green sauce on top if you can handle the spiciness. Also came with a side salad with ginger dressing. This is my personal favorite when I order take out or delivery. Services are great too.' u'Quaint Asian diner. Fabulous lobster spring rolls chicken curry soup and lemon grass soup. Amazing flavors and so fresh.' u'I frequent the SoHo Mooncake weekly I even recommend it to visitors to our firm. \xa0I absolutely love it. \xa0That said I was CitiBiking around and ended up smack-dab in front of Mooncake Hell\'s Kitchen...obviously I headed in.The broth used in the dumpling soups (my fave menu item) is not the same as SoHo. \xa0I mentioned this to the waitress who works in both locations and agreed that SoHo "makes their broth differently". \xa0Broth is the absolute foundation of any soup... how is it that different locations would have different recipes for the broth? \xa0It tasted like water....super disappointing.:(']
4.Ippudo Westside,[u"WOW!!! Ippudo is the best ramen I have ever tried outside of Japan. \xa0The quest for great ramen has been successful and \xa0the search is finally over. \xa0The flavor and saltiness of the soup base is on point. \xa0There is nothing negative to say about this place. \xa0The food service and decor of the restaurant is just amazing. \xa0When we crave for ramen this is our go to ramen place and if you're hungry you can just order an extra order of noodles for just $2 so you can enjoy your ramen just a little more. \xa0The wait can be long but it definitely is worth the wait. \xa0The best times to go are either when it opens or in the middle of the day when it's not a traditional meal time. \xa0I'll be trying this place again soon. \xa0In fact I'll be going here tonight! \xa0You definitely need to visit and eat their amazing ramen." u"This one is less crowded so your wait time isn't as insane but you'll still have to wait a while. Don't bother going to either Ippudo's around dinner time on the weekend you'll waste hours in line it's just insane.Food wise though... So gooooood. Everything on the menu is delicious. I still think the east village one has more variety and is slightly better but this one is still super delicious. Get dat akamaru modern son!" u'One star for service from the host Marcus on Aug 11 at 7:15pm.I initially came in at 5:30 to get seats but Marcus said my entire party had to be present before he could do so. So at 6:15 when my entire party arrived he took my name down and told me it\'d be a 30 min-1 hr wait. An hour later after seeing many parties who arrived after us get seated I asked Marcus how much longer the wait was.He then asked if my entire party was here and I told him we\'d been here since 6:15. He then told me my name had been marked as "incomplete" the entire time and therefore I wasn\'t actually on the waiting list.I told him we\'d been waiting here for an hour but he kept saying it was my fault for not coming to him when everyone arrived even though he clearly instructed me only to put my name down when everyone arrived. In fact he didn\'t even ask me if my party was here the second time around.He then told me the wait was another 45 min-1 hr. I tried to explain that we already waited an hour but he began raising his voice and arguing with me. He repeatedly told me that I should be grateful I didn\'t have to wait an hour and a half like the people who had just walked in (@ 7:15). He continued to blame me for being marked incomplete and eventually WALKED OFF while I spoke to him even muttering (loudly enough for me to hear) "I can\'t deal with this." Like what?Two hours later (@ 8:15) as we were being seated and eating (the ramen came out in 2 minutes & was all great) I saw Marcus pointing at me and snickering to other workers.Our own server Juan was very polite and attentive. He even brought over the manager for us and the manager seemed to be quite familiar with Marcus\' behavior. I don\'t understand how that is tolerated by the management.The food may be good & fast (takes 2 minutes for ramen to come out) but I thought this experience of terrible service needed to be posted. I think Marcus\' behavior as a host was beyond unprofessional and disrespectful.' u"Ippudo Ramen has a clean chic and well-themed facility with an almost party-like atmosphere emphasized by the dim lighting and the sound of people talking in raised voices over upbeat music. On a Tuesday night around 7:30 PM we were seated at a table of four almost immediately; apparently this is because someone else failed to show up for their reservation but it was nice not having to wait.Because I prefer wavy noodles over straight noodles I decided to order the Karakacchan Ramen which wasn't listed on the standard menu but instead was located on a separate insert. The only other ramen experience I've had to compare my experience at Ippudo to is Totto Ramen and in terms of setting and environment Ippudo wins by a decent margin because of the cleanliness and decoration. In terms of ramen though Totto has a slight edge for me. Ippudo's broth is flavorful but light compared to the savory and heavy broth that Totto makes. The Karakacchan also wasn't as spicy and didn't have as many toppings as the ramen I had at Totto which took away some of the flavor I expected. I saw that the options on the standard menu do come with more toppings however so I might make a different selection next time I'm at Ippudo. Price wise Totto is about $3 cheaper.Ultimately though Ippudo's ramen was delicious and the experience was good overall. Service was fast and friendly enough and I'd definitely consider coming here again for some good ramen if I've already had the Totto experience next time I'm in New York." u"I came to Ippudo Westside with my bestie for lunch. She's been here before but didn't mind coming again with me.We met on a Monday afternoon around 12:30PM and already it was crowded! Luckily we didn't have to wait for a table at all and was seated immediately when my friend arrived.I really love that this location is a lot more spacious warm and bright. It's very stylish and chic. Staff is very welcoming warm and friendly. Service is on point.I heard that the Hirata Buns ($9.00 for chicken or pork) were a must-get so my friend and I ordered these for appetizer. The Hirata buns were served with lettuce mayo and Ippudo's spicy sauce. The bun was moist delicious and you definitely feel that spice but luckily you taste and feel a little sweetness too.My friend ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic. The bowl looked very bright and inviting with different ingredients like pork loin chashu bamboo shoots sesame kikurage mushrooms scallions pickled gingers and soft-boiled eggs bathed in Ippudo's original pork broth. I ordered the Akamaru Modern. My bowl looked even more brighter warmer and inviting merely because my ramen was served in a red bowl. This was truly a winning bowl filled with a bolder version of the original pork broth pork chashu cabbage sesame kikurage mushrooms scallions Ippudo's secret Umami Dama paste and fragrant garlic oil. The pork chashu was delicious and juicy and everything else was amazing. The ramen was on point really soaked the flavors and garlic oil from the broth and cooked al-dente - just the way I like it.Overall I really liked our experience and lunch at Ippudo Westside. I can definitely see myself coming back despite the time it takes to travel to Midtown.Service and food was impeccable. \xa0I definitely feel like it's a better experience during lunch but not sure what it's like here during dinner." u"If I come to NYC to visit I must have the best ramen in town. I searched on yelp for my friends and I to visit a second ramen spot for breakfast during our 3rd day of our trip and this came up with one of the highest ratings and reviews. We walked in expecting a 40 minute plus wait as the waiting area is cramped they called for us in less than 20 and we were seated. The dining area was bigger than anticipated. My friends and I got the following:-4 Pork Buns: You can't go to a ramen spot and not try pork buns. These were delicious and the chashu was bursting in savory flavors. -Shiromaru Hakata Classic: Original tonkotsu broth with pork mushrooms ginger and scallion. Love the broth it was perfect flavorings combinedOverall awesome ramen spot on this side of town. I'm sure they're always busy. I wished we had more ramen spots like this in the south but it'll take time." u"Food: 4.5/5.0Service: 3.0/5.0Value: 3.0/5.0Decor: 3.5/5.0Overall: 4.0/5.0 Great ramen per usual. \xa0Solid broth very well cooked thin noodles. \xa0I had the Akamaru and it's obviously not the same but reminds me a little of Ich*ran. \xa0It's popular for a reason after all. \xa0No line on a weekday afternoon which is a massive plus." u"I feel like I just won a prize. That or the Ippudo lottery. You decide. I came in on the earlier side of the lunch rush and as I sat was offered a special menu for a the Gyudon set lunch: a Wagyu beef rice bowl lunch - offered with a salad a side of tonkotsu broth with finely slices scallions fresh red ginger and freshly grated wasabi as a garnish. They only serve it on Tuesdays and only make 10 a day. The waiter let me know there was only one more for the day (by 11:15 am!). So I opted for the rice bowl instead of ramen. Holy onigiri was this the right choice. The buttery beef was so tender it evaporated on my tongue. Kind of like a donburi but without the egg. More sukiyaki style. Seasoned perfectly. The smoky tonkotsu broth was milky in texture and just the right temperature. The salad was fresh and tangy with a hint of mustard seed. And the freshly grated wasabi was the ultimate flavor enhancer at the table. I let the waiter know he helped me make a very good choice and that I'd return the favor ($$ ). I live in the Bay Area and we have a swath of ramen restaurants but something about this meal was so good it has me furiously googling when the Ippudo in Berkeley opens - and how to get on the soft opening list." u'**GOOD RAMEN IN MIDTOWN**I\'ve had Ippudo on the NYC radar for quite awhile now soit was \'bout time.This is their second location in Midtown.AMIBANCE=========Busy so grab a sake drinkat their sake bar in the front area while you wait.Waited an hour which wasn\'t so bad.They text you when your table is ready.Sat at the communal table.Noisy eclectic crowds.FOOD=====HIRATA BUNS - Pork or Chicken $9 Vegetable $8Steamed buns (2pc) filled with our choice of pork served withtheir original spicy buns sauce and mayo.

Do yourself a favor and order more chasu.RATING: 4/5SERVICE=======Efficient but not necessarily fast.It took a long time for our pork buns to come out (30 min)and our ramen was another 20 min.They messed up on our order of the karaage but gave uscomplimentary green tea dessert.RATING: 3.5/5OVERALL========Nice dinner experience and will definitely return.RECOMMEND if you\'re craving pork buns and ramen in Midtown.' u'I have read a lot of good reviews about this place so we decided to try it. We arrived at Ippudo around 2:30 in the afternoon. There was no line up when we got there so we didn\'t have to wait and we got seats right away. For starters we ordered the hirata pork buns($9) and hirata chicken wings($7). The pork buns were smaller than the pork buns that I\'m used to. The pork was tender and it has a little bit of a spicy taste to it they were pretty good. I also loved the chicken wings they were so juicy !!!Since it was still the lunch menu I ordered the Karaka-Men($14) which is pork broth with an added spicy kick. I added a nitamago($2) (soft boiled seasoned egg) as a topping. I also ordered a chicken karaage rice bowl since it\'s only additional $4 for the "lunch set". The broth was a perfect blend of hot spices perfect pork chashu sesame kikurage mushrooms cabbage scallions and garlic oil. The nitamago was the cherry on top it was perfectly poached and seasoned. One of the best ramen I have ever had.' u'LOVED it! \xa0I love ramen and when I visited NYC I pulled my husband around to 3 ramen places. \xa0This place was by far by favorite. \xa0The wait is pretty long especially if you are a bit party but totally worth it. \xa0We started off with the "Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri" which was the cucumber appetizer. \xa0It was refreshing and went well with the Brooklyn Kaedama Ale which is their exclusive beer. \xa0I got their "Shiromaru Hakata Classic" which is their pork broth ramen. \xa0I love the hakata-style broth because it is full of flavor without it being too heavy or oily. \xa0The noodles were a bit overcooked but it might have just been because we were such a big group and they tried to bring out the dishes together. \xa0The Kaedama (extra noodles) came really quick after ordering and it was perfectly cooked. \xa0My husband got the "Akamaru Modern" which was much more bold in flavor as described. \xa0It was a bit too much for me but once he finished the noodles he got a bowl of rice instead of a Kaedama and tossed it into the broth. \xa0The rich flavors seeped into the rice perfectly and it was delicious. \xa0I\'m used to much cheaper ramen in LA like Shinsengumi or Daikokuya but the ramen broth might be my new favorite!' u'Terrible service. We arrived at 11:30 am and the whole restaurant is empty!! We had two people in our party with luggages. The host decided to stuff us at a tiny table with no space for our luggage. Next the flavor is just off. If you have ever tried ippudo in Japan you will know this place is a complete water down.Overall terrible experience!' u"Ippudo is my first New York ramen experience. I wasn't a bit surprised by the snobbish staff but I can't hate on good ramen. After a Sunday matinee Broadway showing of Wicked we were getting hungry and realized we were right around the corner from Ippudo. There was a 35 minute wait for 2 so we put in our phone number and were on our way.INTERIOR:We were seated at the bar which held quite a few people. We were awkwardly facing a couple of other groups of 2 but at least we didn't have to share a tabletop. Servers bustled back and forth between the countertops with bowls of ramen pints of beer and platters of appetizers. SERVICE:Outside food isn't allowed. I had carried in a hot matcha latte that was still 3/4 full and they took it from me and put it in a back room. After dinner they returned it to me; it was still warm. Our server was taking care of quite a few other people so we tried to flag her down every chance we could. She was mostly pretty efficient but had her moments at times where she was no where to be found. It was nice when she noticed I was getting ready to leave that she rushed off without even a little eye contact and returned with my latte. She remembered!FOOD:I'm no ramen connoisseur but this ramen was pretty delicious. I ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic or tonkatsu ramen. The broth was salty but not overly so. It was simple or classic as it has been appropriately coined. I've definitely had ramen with more depth of flavor. I also wasn't a fan of how an egg isn't a standard offering in my ramen. I didn't need it but it would have been nice to have without an up-charge. My sister's ramen was slightly more colorful than my bland offering but I did enjoy the taste of my ramen better. Thank god I wasn't hungry that night because I'm pretty sure I would have still been looking for something more to eat after the meager bowl of noodle soup. It was definitely a once in a lifetime experience for me but at the same time I wasn't super impressed." u'Visited with my son. \xa0Amazing place. 45-60 wait. \xa0Great authentic Japanese environment with loud announcements of guests in Japanese. \xa0Pork broth with egg and bamboo with pork katsu was amazing. \xa0We also had chicken bun which surprisingly juicy and flavorful. \xa0Highly recommended' u"I can yelp this popular restaurant in only 10 words: Ramen at New York's popular Ippudo Westside ... whoaaa fuhgeddaboudit. And since I've got one word left go ahead and capitalize FUHGEDDABOUDIT.Sure I'm picky about my ramen after living in Japan for a few years but at Ippudo I was genuinely surprised by remarkable ramen stellar service Brooklyn brews and bar buns.  \xa0 KEEP \xa0 CALM \xa0 \xa0 and  \xa0RAMEN \xa0 \xa0 ON Ippudo is busy. Enjoy the wait. A sweetheart behind the small bar at the entrance convinced us to enjoy a couple pints of Brooklyn Brewery's refreshing custom-made Kaedama Ale. She was as right about the beer as she was sweet. We added orders of two of the most popular Ippudo food pics on Yelp: Pork Bar Buns and Shishito Peppers. Both appetizers were delicious. I'd get either again ... and hope I do.And then it was Ramen Time. Ichiraku Ramen for her. Shiromaru Hakata Ramen for me. Kaedama (extra noodles) for both of us. It was that good. We slurped the noodles as fast as we could and then slurped even more. Granted I was drunk from the ales and enchanted by the smiles but the ramen at Ippudo Westside fuhgeddaboudit." u"Still my favorite ramen (although I haven't explored other NYC options - I seem to always go for Ippudo when I visit).I can't remember all the appetizers I've had here. The buns are some of the best I've ever had. The karaage is solid. My go-to is the akamaru modern with added pulled chashu (shigureni) and sometimes an egg. The noodles here are perfect. Thin with a great texture. The broth is complex and delicious the chashu is fatty and the shigureni adds a delicious rich flavor to the bowl. I usually end up getting extra noodles. The restaurant in midtown consists of a bar at the front a large shared U shaped table and an area of tables on the side. The service is great and super quick you'll be eating before you know it. Everyone is polite (hosts servers bussers). The wait can be bad but I haven't ever waited over 30 minutes." u"Don't know what all the hype is about but then again I may not be the soundest judge of ramen places as my palate is not as expansive as lets say a ramen fanatic so it maybe that I'm just not that crazy about ramen to begin with in the first place......who knows.anyway came here and ordered two appetizers to being with the pork belly and the fried chicken tenders. Pork belly was okay sauce was sweet and savory while the meat was tender but in all honestly thats pretty standard when ordering pork belly buns my favorite dish of the night was probably the fried chicken tender the spicy mayo sauce was the perfect compliment to this dish the chicken was incredibly tender and the light flakey panco ( I'm assuming ) crust along with the pepper and herbs added to the crust made for a very tasty appetizer I was impressed.For the main dish I ordered the Karaka-men which was just okay in my opinion. It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked and the pork broth overpowered any other flavors and spices that they may have tried to include into the concoction I simply didn't taste anything other than the overpowering flavor of the pork broth.Not my cup of tea and for 14 bucks for a bowl of ramen and nearly a 45 minute wait not something I'd really go out of my way to try again" u'Yesterday was my first time at Ippudo and I\'m happy to say that I\'ve finally found the perfect ramen for my taste!I\'m not fond of ramen that\'s too fatty or salty but the broth here is perfectly balanced - flavorful but not so much as to make he soup hard to drink. The soft boiled egg and he chashu pork are delicious; the noodle is thin yet still has a bit "al dente" texture (which I like).The waiters/waitresses are all super friendly and they also have a nice sake collection to choose from.Ippudo I will be back for sure!' u"Awesome ramen and super friendly service. This place is great! \xa0My review was too short. \xa0Now it's not." u"Just as good as their original location!Ippudo is still my favorite Japanese ramen place and I'm so glad they opened up a second location in NY. My boyfriend and I shared their Akamaru Modern Ramen and it was good. The noodles were al dente and the soup flavorful. We got their soft boiled egg but it was alittle too cooked but still delicious. We also got their Pork Buns! One of my favorites as well! So good! The service was good even though they were super busy around lunch time. The waiter brought out an extra small bowl with a large spoon when we told them we were going to share the ramen. We felt very well taken care of! Thank you!"]
128.Cafe 22,[u"Cafe 22 has been on point recently. The variety of options and flavors is well above average for a corporate cafeteria.The hot food options are very tasty and more satisfying than the typical sandwich or salad. The hot buffet changes everyday and focuses on international cuisine. The hot entree stations have good options; today was made to order steak and chicken Milanese all with sides included. In addition to the hot sandwich salad standard grill and soup stations they make a pretty solid lunch option.Finally with high cost of living can't beat the inexpensive prices." u'Constantly spoiled/rotted food at salad bar - $7 for rotten smelled soft tomatoes' u"Pretty average food here. This caf\xe9 is open for EY Employees only. I would recommend getting the chicken salad sandwich and make sure that you pick a bread that doesn't look too stale. The lines are quite long but the prices are extremely cheap for the area. I got the chicken fingers and they were pretty gross. Very chewy and unsatisfying. I honestly threw them all out because I prefer to think that my chicken isn't completely fake when I'm eating it. The chicken salad was delicious though and you could tell it was made with real chicken. The employee that was checking me out was pretty rude however and I'm not sure exactly why. The smoothies in the morning I heard are very good and custom made. I wish I would have tried one when I was training in the NY office." u"Normally go here when I don't feel like leaving the office or have a meeting around lunch. Pretty cheap sandwiches and salads. For work cafeteria's this is one of the best I have tasted!" u'Are these other reviewers high? \xa0This place is terrible! \xa0Only crowded when the weather outside is bad but you are better fighting the crowds of tourists to eat.' u"This cafe serves EMPLOYEES OF EY ONLY it is NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC!!! This is the cafeteria for the company E&Y at 5 Times Square. I love everything about this cafe! The food is fresh the coffee is fresh the staff and servers are friendly. There's a global hot food section which I love! Monday - Friday each day is food inspired from a different country! Genius! And did I mention the prices! Amazing and very inexpensive compared to the average prices in Times Square." u'Great sushi excellent smoothies and salads.' u"Caf\xe9 22 is my go to lunch on a daily basis - it is a great place to grab something quick but also there are a few stations that are worth the wait. \xa0I agree with the previous reviewers - Tony's salads are great and if you tell him you know Brian he will normally give you extra toppings!! \xa0Also I usually wait in the a la carte sushi line about once a week - a maki roll and 6 pieces of sushi for $10?! \xa0Can't beat it in Times Square!! \xa0And now that they have added a second sushi chef the wait is usually only 10-15 minutes.The choices at the hot buffet are always plentiful and look good but beware sometimes the food can taste pretty bland. \xa0Overall I think they do a great job though keeping the menu diversified and pretty healthy." u"A Restaurant Associates cafeteria with five stars? You've got to be kidding. While I agree that Cafe 22 is a better than average cafeteria (and I've tried plenty) people need to be pickier about their five star reviews. Cafe 22 due to their deal with E&Y offers a very affordable meal in an otherwise terrible neighborhood for food. Be wary o overloading your container at the salad bar or global table - it can add up quickly if your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Crowding and seating can definitely be an issue especially in the winter months and rainy days when the hipster staffers decide waiting in line for Chopp'd isn't worth it. But the view of Times Square is pretty sweet if you can stand the high noise level. Cafe 22 is broken out into several sections: the Illy coffee bar out front the sushi bar/smoothie bar in the AM the global table the main grill (burgers) the main course (changes daily) the action station (which changes each week) shaker salads sandwiches salad bar soup bar. The salad and sandwich lines are usually ridiculous. The grill and sushi lines take forever (unless you're like my colleague who gets in line at 11:30 am). I tend to stick to the global table action station or main course due to the lines alone. The global table is the most hit or miss. With the majority of the staff coming from Latin America and the Caribbean the cuban or jamaican days are fantastic. NEVER ever get the indian food or thai food - its just really terribly not authentic. Even the fake chinese food is terrible. I do like the sandwiches and all the options they offer but I only get them if the line is short. The soups are iffy - sometimes they can be salty. For the vegans or vegetarians there are usually plenty of options. If I'm looking for a balanced lunch I always can find something in Cafe 22 that makes my tummy happy. I dislike Cafe 22 because Restaurant Associates forces you to cater if you use a room on 23 or 22 and the food offerings for these meetings isn't quite as good. The mini sandwiches tend to be dry and nobody eats those little danishes packed with sugar. They also have shameful mini bagels considering we're in the middle of NYC." u"As a warning I was told you have to work in the building to eat here. Since no one else mentioned it I thought I'd give folks a heads up before they head here." u"The assortment here is pretty good but the salads are the best! I've gotten to know a couple people there very well. They're great. Tell Tony that Brian sent you - he'll whip you up a shrimp salad that will rock your world." u'Tony makes a salad worth waiting for! \xa0Make sure you tell him Brian sent you he will make sure to add extra toppings for you!' u"Decent food great prices and extremely convenient. \xa0I'm sure I'll be back quite often. The chicken sandwich on a Kaiser roll is the best deal around. \xa0Make sure you add some chipotle sauce." u"This place is pretty awesome. The atmosphere is very friendly the view is just georgous (Times Squre) and you can see the 'ball'. I usually go to the ready station which surprises me every time. I love this place. I would've given 5 stars but today's chicken wings weren't the best I tried. So 4 it is."]
160.Sticky’s Finger Joint,[u"My love affair with Sticky's began when I visited their first location on 31st street ... Finding out they had opened a 3rd location I was excited since this location is easier for me to visit. In comparison to 31st this location is nicer  this one is bigger & has a more comfortable seating area. Fun decor  love the colorful mural. I've tried my share of the Chicken before this time around I decide to try the Thai fiesta & the Chicken poppers with the vampire aoli & mac sauces. The Thai fiesta fingers were very good  nice big pieces of chicken covered in a sweet Thai sauce this was great. Chicken poppers seem to be new to the menu regular fried pieces of chicken these are meant to be dipped the vampire aoli is very good nice garlic taste  the Mac sauce was interesting at first ? Not bad tho taste like Mac & cheese of course taste good on the chicken. New food additions to this menu sandwiches wraps & salads not bad looking forward to trying then in future visits. Nice location  service was good & prices are not bad depending on what you get." u"I heard good things about this place and the menu was really enticing but honestly I just couldn't eat it.Ordered the buffalo chicken strips and I think the reason why it was so inedible for me is that they just dumped too much sauce on it making it an absolute salt bomb. Like even though I could tell it's quality plump chicken and a crispy breading underneath the sauce just ruined it. And the bleu cheese crumbles on top didn't help either.Then I thought maybe I'll like it better if I'm drunk. So I stashed it in the fridge and tried it the following night after a Thirsty Thursday but nope. Nope nope. I tossed it." u"Good chicken fingers. \xa0They've got a lot of tasty sauces and good chicken and fries. \xa0Chicken and fries seem to be about the only thing they do so don't go in expecting great variety. \xa0Also they are extremely stingy with sauce - you get one small container of sauce and an extra small container is a dollar. \xa0Not great there Sticky's. \xa0But the food is tasty so I'll probably be back at some point." u"There are places that make you wait for hours for delivery ... and there are places like Sticky's where the delivery guy literally shows up like 15 minutes after you put in the order. \xa0Even I was kind of freaked out at how fast the food got to my place. \xa0That alone is worth a five star rating.But let's not forget the food. \xa0Heard about this new outpost near my digs and decided to satisfy my irrational desire for a good chicken sandwich by ordering a spicy chicken sandwich some cajun fries and a side of cabbage. \xa0The cabbage for the record is a total waste of money. \xa0Don't even bother. \xa0But the sandwich and the fries were seriously kick ass.The spicy chicken sandwich was at one point crispy .. but the crazy amount of slaw and hot sauce that was oozing on the sandwich turned it into some kind of Frankenstein's monster. \xa0Only it was a really good monster. \xa0The flavor was outstanding. \xa0If you like light food don't even think about ordering the spicy chicken. \xa0I have a pretty high tolerance for heat but this thing was pretty damn spicy. \xa0I honestly would have stopped eating it if not for the fact it was so tasty. \xa0The cajun fries were a perfect compliment to the awesomeness of the spicy chicken. \xa0It did get a bit salty after a while but honestly it was still worth it.Next time I might take a more conservative approach and order the classic but I still really enjoyed my meal and the ultra fast delivery definitely deserves some serious brownie points!!" u"Pretty good chicken! Very crispy. There are a lot of sauces to choose from.My bf went to get food there and just came back. I was craving chicken and fries as well. So I ordered the signature chicken poppers (that comes with small fries) and he got a regular one with the sauce on the side.Took a star away because I opened the box only to find chicken and no fries... thought maybe it would be at the bottom...nope..bit disappointed. And I don't want to walk all the way there just to get the fries." u"This third location of Sticky's is the largest and best yet with more seating and space including booths.There are also some new menu items exclusive to this location for now. They have wraps which you can fill with grilled chicken or fried chicken but most notably the new Hot Chicken / Szechuan Spicy Fried Chicken is so hot it will make you sweat. If you like spicy make sure you try this.All of the excellent original stuff is here too like the sandwiches the specialty fingers and the amazing fries in all varieties. Definitely get the Bacon Mac Fries and don't scoff at the S'mores Fries as they're actually an excellent combo. Anything really goes well though with the fries here which are perfectly crispy and salty." u"Oh ya I luck out walking down 9th Avenue looking for new food spot for me to check out and I 'm there when Stinky's Fingers opens up for the first day in there new restaurant. \xa0 at 4:00 PM and I got there 6:30 PM I waited on a line that went around the block until I could order after 45 minutes.I got the crunchy Chicken Finger Basket and Fries to go since all the tables were taken. \xa0They have about 8 tables with 20 seats. I nibble on my food on the way home. \xa0It was good tasting chicken not (sticky?) I didn't know at the time since I was new to Sticky's that they have a dozen sauces to add to your chicken and one is called Sticky another is called Vampire?Oh and I love the flavor of the coating on the chicken and the meat was not dry. The fries where also good it you look close at them you can see the flaky outer crust on the potato I don't know how they get it that way. I got the plan classic fries but you can get Cajun or something called pop pie fries. They forgot to give me ketchup or ran out Oh how I wish I could have sat down to enjoy it.Maybe No of course I will go again to try and get more chicken with some of the sauces like Vampire Aioli Green Tea Caesar or Wasabi. And some of the other items on the menu soon like Popers and the \xa0Salted Caramel Pretzel. Today's first day was just to crazy to think of options because they had $1 baskets of chicken fingers and poppers between 4 and 7pm but I got to the counter at 7:15 ;-(" u'R. is in the building.i have long avoided Sticky\'s for fear of ruining the key element of any birthday boy diet: chicken fingers. the other elements of a birthday boy diet are obviously...SPOILER ALERT...ice cream cake and soda. duh.the digs themselves. clean. shiny. colorful. there are seating options flush right as you enter. a couple of booths and smaller tables. on the left there is a table inset to the wall for those who prefer to stand aka standing room only. haha. straight ahead to the back is where you order. most options are pretty straight forward. the space itself feels big even though square footage puts it more at a medium-ish size. amazed at despite the junky eats...how clean the space was. PRO TIP: you can get the chicken fingers fried or grilled. get them fried. grilled chicken fingers are WEAAAAAK like your dad\'s game...which is why he ended up with your momzzzz. lolthe fingers? the chi\'k\'n be magnificent. crispy crunch outside. flavorful chicken meat on the inside. the vampire killer aioli sauce --thick creamy spiced right...perfection. you get one complimentary sauce with each fingers order...outside of ketchup...which they have a treasure chest of. you can ask to sample before choosing one. definitely want to try buttermilk baby ranch cray sauce \xa0and wasabi aioli next time. there about 20 different sauces!PRO TIP: three fingers is enough for 1 person. the LARGE = five fingers...great for two to share and you get two sauces!all chicken finger baskets come with fries. i opted for the bacon cheese fries. glorious to the eye. smelled great. i would say it\'s a tad on the salty side actually it\'s pretty salty. maybe it was the combo of eating the fingers and these fries...but the fries seemed over salted--and add the the saltiness from the cheese sauce and bacon...and you have a sodium bomb. they were still pretty edible but i couldn\'t finish them. if you order them ask to ease up on the seasoning and you should be fine. \xa0curious to try the pot pie fries next!the rest of the sides are different variations of the fries...or not real veggies like slaw or pickles. loloutside of chicken fingers you can get poppers chicken sandwiches made up of the chicken fingers or salads with chicken fingers. and you can get wraps as well. drinks: soda Boyle\'s soda & water...water or a can will run you almost two bucks. lame. they do have Black Cherry Boyle\'s soda...but that\'s even more than 2 bucks.PRO TIP: bring your own water or drank. the staff: cool quick hardworking. not very chatty. but they keep the place sparkling and moving like a well-oiled machine...so no complaints there.ANECDOTE: as i was eating a woman with a walker/cane--about 30+ years of age but looked more like 50+ bc she\'s been ravaged by obesity and the aging effects of fast food--stood waiting for a table but no one was getting up. since i have done no good deeds in 2016 i decided to give my table up ...so said lady could eat. hitting ::PAUSE BUTTON:: a table away was a dude who obviously worked for STICKEY\'S who was obnoxiously cackling into his iphone earbuds\' mic while he slapped away at a PC (probably an IBM thinkpad--who uses that weak PCtech). the guy was probably a manager/pr person/"consultant" etc. who doesn\'t do any work at the location but takes up a table to mindlessly ramble over the phone out loud. the woman who needed a table was in clear view of him. however this human form of STAPH infection continued to giggle aloud and probably play World of Warcraft and not give up the table. ::UNPAUSE:: it was fairly clear that i was cutting my meal short but i decided to do the "right thing" and get up & give up my table. as soon as i got up the woman hit turbo boost (farted probably ) and whooshed over faster than a electric wheelchair with nitro and sat down. she didn\'t even say THANK YOU \xa0or anything! what a goddamn TURD. serves me right for doing the right thing. point of the story. take your food from Sticky\'s and eat anywhere but there bc this is the type of customer you\'ll be sitting next to: 250 lbs of mushy turd/ette/s overstuffed into a 100 lbs. bag who has a Super Cuts haircut and bad dye job. or you\'ll be forced to listen to the inanity of one of their "suits" who\'s probably being \xa0CATFISHED by some dude in Riker\'s. i have pics not posting of both trainwreckages of humanity...not to protect the innocent...but to protect your eyes from gratuitous grossness X 2. regardless of the anecdote the food here is good. fries be salty. the digs be clean. staff are great.the cost: chikn $7-$8 + bacon cheese fries $5-$6 + Boyles sida (delicious) $3-$4 + tax equals lots of delicious at a high cost for fast casual food. drops mic bc chicken fingers take priority over emceeing!i out.zzz' u"Really liked it here! It decorations inside were super cute people there were really nice too!! The food was good loved the Thai sweet chili and the sticky's sauce! Can't wait to try other sauces!! (The sauce comes with the chicken basket but if you buy the sauce individually it's around a dollar I think! )" u'what is this new world that has been opened up before methe salted caramel pretzel signature is my new favorite' u"Dropped by for their grand opening promo: selling baskets of their classic Fingers OR Poppers for $1. 4:15pm line wasn't too ridiculous despite the blog press and the staff handled it well albeit with a number of hiccups with confusing who ordered what. The Buffalo Balsamic Maple sauce however was just buffalo and thus a huge disappointment* but the fries and chicken were solid. This outpost is their first to serve alcohol and the decor is pretty great street art-style murals.*We'll see how they react given their history of social media impropriety." u'My child wanted wings for his 12th birthday dinner. \xa0We could walk here from the hotel so we gave it a try. \xa0He enjoyed the wings! \xa0I tried one of the wrap sandwiches with grilled chicken. \xa0If you get this tell them only a bit of sauce. \xa0I was literally squeezing my sandwich and letting the sauce pour onto my plate. \xa0It was ridiculously covered and not in a good way. \xa0The people working the counter were nice and friendly. \xa0They do have a bathroom so you can wash your sticky fingers when done. \xa0The wall is painted in a cool artsy way (see photo).' u"Okay after a crazy day of running around there's nothing quite like some comfort food to wind down. \xa0The restaurant itself its is industrial with some cool art on the walls but clean and kind of simple. The food although yes it is fast and fried its pretty good. \xa0This is no dieters place your defiantly packing a high calorie meal here but man is it good. \xa0I love spicy food so I tried the Basket Buffalo Blue Crunchy it comes with fries. \xa0The flavor is really amazing I chose the smallest size but its a huge portion I couldn't finish all of it. \xa0This place is my new guilty pleasure." u"Best chicken fingers I've ever had. \xa0They use fresh chicken and you can really taste the difference. \xa0Their sauce is also pretty special and worth the extra dollar they charge for it." u"Sticky's newest location!! I am so glad they opened up in Hell's Kitchen. The other two locations were too far for me.. Much bigger than their other two locations with fun murals stretched out on their wall. Only at this location you will be able to try their wraps you can get with either grilled or fried chicken. Not a huge wrap fan but theirs was delicious and especially with the sauce they put in. You must also try their new Southern/Szechuan style chicken. So hot & spicy it was perfect for me. Great food and friendly staff!" u"We are visiting NYC and I found this place on Facebook via Insider page.. It's like 15 mins walk away from times square. Came here monday afternoon and this place is very neat and clean good ambiance and a lot of friendly staffs.. Especially the bearded guy with cap.. He's very nice and very accommodating! He even gave us a sample when I told him that it was our first time there. Hope the management give him incentives for his hardwork. ^_^ Probably it would be the last time (for now) to visit this place because we are from SF. :( But if you are in nearby area dont hesitate to try this place! Especially the thai fiesta! Bomb!" u"I had been watching for the opening of Sticky's Finger Joint and when I passed by the other day I realized it was already in full swing. I got a copy of the take out menu just to see what was available and to make an educated choice when I got to the counter. After perusing the menu I decided to get the poppers [no fries] and i was entitled to one sauce so i got the sassy BBQ. I was hungry but not that hungry and I didn't realize how much food i would be getting. It was delicious. The staff was accommodating and the food came quickly. It is a fairly small place but there is adequate seating and there is also a counter along one wall. i would recommend and return." u'I walked by when the first opened and saw a line outside the door so I had to give it a try. I order the chicken fingers and fries with a traditional BBQ sauce. The chicken tenders were a great size moist and juicy. I would go back' u'The chicken fingers are all white meat and pretty thick. Lots of sauces to choose from I tried the vampire aioli barbecue chipotle mayo sweet chili and sticky sauce which were all good. My preference is the vampire aioli but there are tons more to choose from.' u'The fried food is great. The prices are a little expensive for the fast food vibe but I have never had a bad experience.']
49.Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen,[u"The soup dumplings were delicious even though they are a little expensive but it's New York city!The soy milk tasted great as well." u"This is amazingly over rated. I had just enough time to grab a bowl of soup on a hot and steamy NYC evening in July. The restaurant is a tiny crowded single room with tables from wall to wall. I was lucky enough to get seated immediately. I was then joined by two strangers who sat with me. I got the signature noodle soup with chicken. It arrived 3.1 minutes after I ordered. \xa0It was a bit lacking on flavor. I've had better Ramen. \xa0Perhaps I was hoping for Japanese style - which this was not. My table mates seemed happy with their food - which looked a lot better than mine. It's amazing they turn out such good tasting food so quickly. It's amazing they can squeeze so many people into such a tiny space." u"As a hardcore soup dumpling fan I have to say this place exceeds my expectations. Although the dumpling skin isn't as thin as Din Thai Fung's these are massive dumplings. Massive soupy dumplings. I ordered take out and by the time that I got home the soup was already dripping out; however each dumpling still managed to hold a couple of slurps of soup. Quite impressive. I also ordered the duck ramen but that was fairly unmemorable. The duck was tender but the noodles were pretty bland.The take out wait time of the restaurant was pretty short. I put in the order and my food was ready in five minutes. However there was a pretty long line in front of the restaurant. Overall I would most definitely come again for the xiao long bao." u'Soup dumplings are the most amazing thing in the world. \xa0Except on the menu they\'re called steamed "buns". Reasonably priced. Fast delivery. \xa0Small inside the restaurant so it\'s better to take out but they do have a few tables in there.' u'This place is small so do everyone a favor and come in small groups. \xa0Totally do not recommend bring babies who can not ask for anything without using real words in here. You will slow the line down. Probably the best XLB in the area. \xa0All other foods are great too. \xa0Love their dumplings and chive pies. \xa0Great place to share little plates with your party. \xa0Cheap and great food...what more can you ask for but a bigger restaurant. \xa0But its NYC...' u"3.5 starsIf you're looking for Japanese style ramen this is not your place. This place serves up Chinese la mien which is different but just as wonderful as Japanese style ramen.I ordered the beef ramen for pick up- I had heard stories of people waiting for long periods of time for lunch (when I went to go pick up I saw some groups waiting outside in the rain!) Upon entering it was PACKED (the stories are true!!)The Beef Ramen was delicious- the broth was not too salty simple and tasty. The noodles were chewy and firm (because life is too short for soggy noodles!) Top it all off with bokchoy cilantro green onion and flavorful slices of beef. They were not stingy with the slices of beef!Will come back for the beef scallion pancakes (But only after payday because this place is a little pricier than you'd expect)" u"Food here is really subpar and a bit overpriced for the quality and flavor. It doesn't live up to the price tag on each dish. I would come back for the XLB but with that I would still have to think twice about because of the service.Our waitress had a bit of an attitude (it's the girl with the backwards hat on and glasses) it seems like she was annoyed to take our order. During the time I was there she was training another waitress on serving and while the new trainee was doing something wrong the mean girl with the hat was yelling at her in Mandarin infront of all the customers. Which was quite inappropriate." u"I ordered delivery and it came within 30 mins. Perfect for a night in!I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about but even with delivery my meal was still pretty awesome. Everything arrived at a decent temperature and my pancakes were still crispy! Eats. + Shrimp Veggie and Pork xiao long bao - aka soup dumplings. Some pieces came open but each one was still juicy. There was a good balance of shrimp pork and veggies in each one. They were better than I expected but probably because the reviews were so negative about them. I really don't think they're horrible but I also haven't tried many of the other popular places. 6 pieces for ($9.95). + Beef scallion pancake. It was good but not great! It was still crispy when I had it (and I had it delivered) so I'm happy! Pretty filling though. $6- Duck buns. I was really excited about these since I love Peking duck - but these were just OK. I was hoping for bao buns instead but one bun satisfied my craving. $6.95 per order (which includes 2).I'd definitely order again if I'm in the area - I went to Joe's Shanghai and thought the soup dumplings here were better!" u"This place is amazing! The food is excellent and cheap and the service is incredibly fast. You can actually watch the chef hand-pulling the noodles and it's pretty awesome to watch him.This isn't the Japanese-style ramen but more like Chinese lo-mein. We highly recommend the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes and any dishes made with their hand-pulled noodles. Value for your money and truly fresh delicious food!" u"That's not how we make noodles and buns......the noodle is little bit hard to chew the bun on the contrary is too soft...Actually I think it would be better if you exchange the way you deal with flours when making noodles and buns that's my (useless) advice.I know people change the way they cook just to cater to the preference of the local people so maybe my suggestion is not right but I myself just don't like the way it feel in my mouth.One more thing they automatically add 15 percent tips on your bill and when you need to sign another bill there's still a section for you to give tips...I myself didn't give anymore some." u"Wandering the wastelands of Hell's Kitchen I stumbled upon Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen. To someone unaccustomed to true Chinese cuisine Kung Fu very well might seem authentic. However me being a Chinese native my tastes are much more keen and Kung Fu sadly falls a bit short.First of all DON'T order the ramen here. Yes while its true that the Chinese invented noodles I have to hand it over to the Japanese who have perfected ramen. The ramen here looks EXACTLY like Cup Noodles the noodles even have the same flat shape and consistency you would find in a Cup Noodles. Why blow $12 on a mediocre bowl of noodles when you can get something almost the same for 99 cents at any grocery store? Also just by looking at how thin and clear the soup is I could tell that it was lacking in flavor.Your best bet would be to order the dumplings here. The soup dumplings here thankfully they get right...........the skin is the right thickness and the pork inside was perfectly tender and so juicy. The most comical order I made here were the Sticky Rice Shu Mai. First of all there is no such thing in true Chinese dim sum. Sticky rice and shu mai are two DIFFERENT kinds of dim sum and they are both served very differently. Sticky rice is always supposed to be wrapped in a banana or a lotus leaf. Shu mai are similar to dumplings except that the skin is much thinner and the proportion of meat or shrimp is so much higher. But no matter what at no point should the two be fused together!! But that's exactly what they did here. Tsk Tsk. I really strive not to be a complainer and that's why I've given this place 3 stars. The dumplings are very good comparable to the quality you would find in Chinatown and despite my scalding critique at the sticky rice shu mai Frankenstein they actually tasted quite good LOL." u'Knowing that we had a 7pm show of "Fun Home" I had to find an eating place that was relatively close to the theatre and could get us in and out fast. Thanks to Yelp Kung Fu our bellies were full and we made it to the theatre in plenty of time. After we were seated promptly we ordered knife cut noodles with pork xiao long bao and Shanghai Dumplings. The noodles and XLB came out fast within 10 minutes. I loved the chewy texture of the noodles but unfortunately they lacked flavor. (They just tasted like soy sauce.) The XLB were fantastic! So much flavor and juice! Last to come out (it took the advertised 20 minutes) were the Shanghai dumplings. I\'ve had this variety at a few San Diego restaurants but this one was the very best. They were perfectly steamed and pan fried. Like the XLB watch out for abundance of hot juice coming out!Unlike many establishments that I\'ve encountered in the Asian restaurant mecca of San Diego (Convoy/Kearny Mesa) the service here was fantastic! I never had to ask for water (as they came around to refill at least three times) and they were fast!' u'Asian food in midtown sucks! Asian food in Hell\'s Kitchen is good only when the cuisines are Thai or Japanese. I\'ve tried many times with many businesses and this has just become a fact. With this well known fact at heart I didn\'t think I\'d be a fan of Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen. (Oh what a name!) I am a fan though! When a delivery order of their soup dumplings didn\'t disappoint I knew I had to stop in. Let me first make this comment on their delivery. I ordered soup dumplings...xiao long bao...kung fu steamed dumplings. The skin isn\'t excessively thick yet somehow the dumplings held their soup even when delivered. That\'s really frickin\' impressive! I\'ve been in the shop a few times now and I\'ve tried a variety of items: soup ramen fried ramen buns dumplings scallion pancakes etc. I\'ve liked just about everything I\'ve tried but haven\'t loved anything enough to come out of my way to eat here. I work near here so I will happily come after work and that\'s it. Prices are much higher than what I\'m accustomed to paying for this type of food but we are in midtown (not Chinatown Flushing or Elmhurst) so it makes sense. Cards are accepted. A 15% "service charge" is automatically charged to your bill as gratuity regardless of payment method but they still leave a note of suggested gratuity ON TOP of the total bill that already included their auto-gratuity. That\'s a bit shady. I do expect gratuity to be automatically added when I come with a group but coming in as a pair I would at least expect some sort of notice that this would be standard practice on every bill...a sign on the wall a note on the menu. I don\'t see anything. Shady. Service has been good for the most part so at least the tips are well-deserved.' u"After hearing from a friend that the chef here makes his own noodles (which you could see from the dining room) I knew I had to try it (add on the fact that they have soup dumplings and there was no question).My friend and I arrived around 6:45 on a Wednesday evening and were seated immediately.We decided to split everything and ordered: Pork soup dumplings scallion pancake with beef vegetable dumplings house special ramen stir fryService was efficient and food came out as it was ready. I was surprised that the noodles in the ramen weren't that memorable at all. I guess making the noodles by hand didn't really make a difference to me. The scallion pancakes were fantastic (if not too many scallions). The beef was really tender inside the crispy pancake.The pork soup dumplings were SOOOO good. Paired with some vinegar and I could have eaten 12 on my own. The vegetable dumplings were pretty good if not a tad bland. I found I needed a bit of vinegar and/or soy for these.Overall a really solid place in hell's kitchen. I'd definitely be back for scallion pancakes and soup dumplings!!Note: $30 minimum on credit cards" u"Wound up here after taking one look into Ippudo and seeing how many people were waiting. #nope. A short distance away the place was pretty full which is always a good sign. And no frills! Ordered the house specialty ramen pan fried pork dumplings and scallion pancakes. I was a little disappointed in the ramen - it looked wonderful but lacked in flavor. Some sriracha helped but I was sad I needed it. The meat was also very very fatty. My husband had the ramen with duck and almost every piece was fat or bone/gristle. I do have to say that the hand-pulled noodles in the ramen were fantastic - cooked al dente and not too gummy or thick.Luckily the rest of the meal made up for the ramen. The scallion pancakes were perfect and not at all greasy and we asked for some hot tea and got a great tea that wasn't too florally and was piping hot. The star of the show was clearly the namesake of the restaurant - the buns! We opted for the pan fried version and they were amazing. Cooked perfectly with a crisp pan fried bottom... Mmmm. So if you're looking for great buns (haha) this is your place. Ramen - I'd look elsewhere." u'Upon entering. I was mystified as to why a Chinese restaurant would include "Ramen" in its title. Then I saw the name written in Chinese and I\'m like oh this restaurant was probably named by Google Translate. Lol.As it is the eponymous "ramen" was far from the highlight of my visit. We had ordered the stir-fried variety with pork. On the whole the dish seemed very oily.The "steamed buns" however came off far better. The shengjian bao tasted nearly as good as those I\'ve had in China. And just like any authentic "bao" and just like what she said be very careful of the squirting. Their xiaolong bao worked just as excellently with a flavor unadorned by spices but which relies on the meat to carry the flavor.As the cherry on top the restaurant seems to continuously play a documentary on the founding chef\'s origins in China. It was pretty entertaining.Summary: Kung fu level squirting.' u"This is the best Chinese restaurant within a 5 minute walking distance of Broadway shows. I come here every time before seeing a show and have never been disappointed.Highly recommend the beef noodle soup and the xiao long bao. Prices are slightly on the high side but the food is authentic and delicious. The pigs ears appetizer is not that great. Also their takeout is super fast. Our food for a group of 3 was ready within 5 minutes and this included xiao long bao.Really recommend this place if you're in the area!" u'Amazing food and amazing atmosphere the food is always at the best quality. There is a lot of pride put into every dish.' u"I ordered the shredded beef. Keep in mind it's a pool of grease and rice is too expensive apparently for them to include it in the order." u'Be careful to tell them if you want to eat things one at a time. Otherwise like me everything will arrive quickly and your soup dumplings will get cold. When I was surprised waitress said " In China all food arrives when ready." I wanted to say that I\'m in NYC and I\'m not Chinese.More importantly they add a 15% gratuity automatically. I\'m sure some don\'t realize and over/double tip!!Not a good practice/ probably takes advantage of tourists! Food was good but nothing special.']
27.City Kitchen,[u"I love places like this in New York - everything that is tasty all in one place. Sure some of them are obviously not as good as other stands but when you have so much to choose from you can afford one or two failures. If you're in Midtown and looking for a place to eat and can't decide where stopping by here is a great option. Only bad part is their hours - should be open later!" u"I was quite surprised that Times Square even had a food court. This place looks very modern and cozy. The display of the interior design makes it very inviting to eat here. There's a whole range of cuisine all located in one small convenient location. However the prices definitely reflect the Times Square prices. For very small portions the prices are really expensive. I ate a roll of sushi with 8 small pieces and it was $12. I also tried one of their tacos and it was $5 for a small one. Dough was also one of their vendors and for one big doughnut it was around $4. As for the quality of food it was nothing special. I don't know what else to say about it. I'd say try this place out if you are ever in Times Square. Not many tourists know about this place so City Kitchen doesn't always get as crowded as other restaurants." u"We stumbled upon this food court after trying to go to Shake Shack across the street and finding a huge line there. This food court was clean and generally better than your average fast food food court since the vendors are associated with actual restaurants. Yes the prices are expensive - a small burger at Whitman's is $8 and a small bowl of ramen at Kuro-Obi is $12 - but the location is right off of Times Square where you can expect everything to be more expensive. I still think it's a cool concept that should be more common in cities. \xa0 As for the food we tried Whitman's Luke's Lobster and Kuro-Obi and all enjoyed what we got. It took a while to get the food after ordering but that's because they were making it fresh. Would recommend if you're in the area and want a casual meal with different options." u"Yo what happen to my City Kitchen review you can't say I been here over 20 times and never did a review no way I watching you YELP!!! \xa0Well I guess I have to do a do over. \xa0The City Kitchen open up like 18 months ago just when I started Yelping and what I like about the place most is I can go here in the mornings and afternoons when I commute to and from the PABT and get something like Dough dougnuts Luke's Lobster Rolls and Kuro Obi Ramen all at the same time. just like I just like I just did for takeout.Wow my BFF is eating good and putting on some baby fat but nothing that a good body massage can't rub away. :-)'Now the City Kitchen is on the 2nd floor of the Row Hotel and has it's own entrances in addition to one ones from inside the hotel. \xa0They have the better name vendors like Azuki Box Luke's Lobster Sigmund's Pretzels Dough \xa0Kuro Obi Whitmans Gabriela's Taqueria sushi from Azuki and Woolys. This should be a good option for both local pencil pushers cube dwellers Hell's Kitchen residents and lazy tourists who don't want to try too hard to make a meal happen and or don't want to venture out from the hotel into Times Squares and get abducted my Elmo.Now the place is not that big but you have places to sit at tables and along the long window counter where you can see the crazies pedestrians and lost tourist on 8th Avenue and on the hotel side which has a few more vendors and a bar. Expect the place to be real loud if it's lunch or dinner time. Also remember to line up on the left side of the vendors to order and pick up on the right side. This is always a bit of confusion going on with lining up on the wrongs spots." u"a nice food court surprisingly not crowded on a Saturday afternoon given the fact it's located close to time square! Quality food and nice ambiance (clean bright and modern). Nothing is more soul-and-stomach filling than a bowl of good ramen after 45miles cycling! I ordered the Kuro-Obi (creamy chicken soup ramen) with umami egg. The light yellow marinated running egg yolk is absolutely delicious!!! The ramen soup is super rich (I like it better than some of the ippudo ones.) and the ramen is chewy. There also sushi Mediterranean food lobster rolls and Mexican food available as well. Worth a visit if you want a quick bite." u"Finally a food hall in times square that tourists don't know about (yet). Yes go to Shake Shack go to Bubba Gump. Stay away. This collection of ramen and doughnuts and sushi and lobster rolls located on the 2nd floor of a random building is all mine. Sure there are some stools for people to sit. Those are mine too." u"City Kitchen is a very cool concept. It gives tourists and local New Yorker's alike a chance to sample a variety of foods from various restaurants that are located around the city. We saw a donut shop seafood sushi Mexican and american fare available here. What's nice about this food court is that it gives large groups the opportunity to sample a variety of different cuisines under one roof. This is golden for a few reasons. Firstly if you have picky eaters in your party they are are likely able to accommodate \xa0a variety of tastes. Secondly the location is golden not far from the main attractions. Location is everything! Additionally the space is very modern and welcoming. Lastly the prices are reasonably by Times Sq. standards.I tried Luke's (the lobster roll place). I tried the shrimp roll per the recommendation of the staff member. They offer the option to add chips and a drink. The shrimp roll was good but very small. I would recommend in order to get your money's worth trying someplace else unless you're looking for a small snack. The Mr. had a cheesesteak from Whitman's and had no complaints regarding his meal.Space is limited so getting a seat within the City Kitchen area can be a little tricky. Instead we walked into the adjoining hotel which is accessible from the main dining room of City Kitchen. There are additional seats available there as well as a huge TV." u'When in an unfamiliar city go where the locals go. \xa0 \xa0 The wife and I were on our way to a 2pm theater when we stumbled upon this place in Times Square New York City. \xa0All the locals seemed to go upstairs in this building called City Kitchen and so we followed. \xa0 Turned out to be a food kitchen with half a dozen very upscale fast food restaurants. \xa0 We checked out Luke\'s Lobster and it\'s basic menu: bottled drink with chips and pickle with shrimp $12 crab $16 lobster $19. \xa0Add a soup to the combo for $4 more. \xa0Line up at the counter place your order pay find a seat wait for your number and pick up your order. \xa0Common seating on long benches among the half dozen restaurants in the food court.Place was packed and noisy with very few open tables available and those tables covered with food and drink debris from the previous occupant -one star deducted for poor service keeping open tables clean. \xa0Lots of people seemed to be nursing a drink enjoying the view down below oblivious to those people with full meals looking for an open table in short supply.We managed to get a table but had to sweep all the food debris onto the floor and put other people\'s garbage away -habits of locals! \xa0 Welcome to New York City! \xa0Not the best of ambiance for a hot date but after 13 years of marriage my wife is very accommodating. We get our order a crab combo with New England clam chowder chips pickle and a bottle of blueberry soda -my wife\'s favorite. \xa0The New England clam chowder is to die for -among the very best I\'ve ever tasted and the first time I\'ve had chowder on the East Coast -yes somethings they do better than in California! \xa0The chips I could do without -turned out to have vinegar in the chips -never heard of such a thing. \xa0Wife says it is the British influence. \xa0One thing they do better in California. \xa0The crab on a bun is also excellent not too salty with crab from the body not the more desirable leg area and not saturated with mayo as we see in California. \xa0The bun is about the size of a 6" hot dog bun so the serving size is on the small size and pricey. $21.78 out the door for the crab combo. \xa0And we shared this lunch. Excellent meal but pricey for what you get and I\'ve tasted better crab sandwiches but not too often. \xa0Next time we\'ll have to try the lobster roll for this chain restaurant with a dozen locations in the big Apple. \xa0Stopped by a street vendor and picked up some gummy bears to ward off hunger pains the rest of the afternoon.' u"This is a high end food court in Times Square. Pretty nice with some cool vendors such as Luke's Lobster Kuro Obi and Dough. Seating is nice with tables for 4 and counters along the side but during busy times not enough. My major gripe is that almost all the food items are quite expensive but I understand it's due to several factors: The restaurants themselves being pricey and the fact that it is in Times Square. I have tried food from Luke's Lobster Whitman's Gabriela's Taqueria and Dough. Out of all of them I would suggest Luke's and Whitman's. Luke's Lobster - I had a sample of the shrimp roll which was extremely flavorful and delicious. Whitman's - I ordered the peanut butter and bacon burger and enjoyed it very much! I know it seems like a weird combo but it worked well together. The beef burger was yummy and came with crispy bacon and tasty peanut butter. I really liked the flavors and also had a side of french fries which were wonderful! And there was a lot of it. It was perfectly crunchy with great potato taste! Gabriela's Taqueria - The chicken quesadilla was just okay for me. There wasn't enough cheese for me but a decent amount of shredded chicken though it wasn't very seasoned. Also I wasn't a fan of the the sauce that they used. Dough - Most people I know LOVE and wax poetic about how good Dough donuts are... I'm not most people. I have tried their donuts on several occasions and have never felt that they were that tasty. I tried their special flavor made for City Kitchen's 1 year anniversary: Salted Caramel Chocolate and it was mediocre. The chocolate was good of course because how could chocolate NOT be? The caramel was supposed to be underneath but there was very little caramel taste. I'm thinking their filled donuts would be yummier but I'm not about to spend $3.50 to find out. A note about City Kitchen's 1 year birthday celebration... Management didn't know how to handle the crowd and it was a complete zoo in the beginning filled with rude people pushing and shoving their way to get the free sample! Good thing City Kitchen finally came to their senses by ordering everyone out and starting a line outside only allowing a certain number of people in at a time which they should have had the foresight to do from the start because I could have gotten seriously injured. Also I was really looking forward to trying Wooly's (shaved ice) but they aren't at the location anymore. This place was okay to go to a couple of times for a quick bite with friends but in the nearby area (Hell's Kitchen) there are so many better restaurant options with more amazing food and choices." u'In a hurry? Casual dining? Try City Kitchen\'s food court out.My friend informed me about this place that opened around March 2015 raving how good this place was.You enter the City Kitchen doors and go up stairs to open a metal door to see the bustling place with hungry touristy diners gathered for hyped food concepts in New York. Large windows with sunlight lighting this clean place. Honestly I was stuck to what to try due to the 6 different vendors that appealed to me. Dough was out of the question for I came hungry! Vendors:Azuki - Sushi JapaneseBox - Mediterranean TakeawayDough - Doughnuts and CoffeeGabriela\'s Taqueria - MexicanLuke\'s - Lobster Crab or Shrimp RollsKuro-Obi - RamenWhitman\'s New York - Burgers CheesesteakKuro-Obi at City Kitchen:-Kuro-Obi "Black Belt" (3/5 Creamy chicken soup ramen with Zuzutto noddles garlic oil and Umami miso paste): Portion was smaller than what I would have liked. Noodles were great but the paste mixed made it thicker and saltier than without the mix. Overpriced - paying about $12 for ramen broth two pieces of pork belly and scallions without additional ingredients. -Aka-Obi "Red Belt" (4/5 Creamy chicken soup ramen with Zuzutto noodles and spicy miso paste): Similar to what I said above but I preferred this one - much better to my liking and taste. This was not salty just the right combination.-Pork Buns (2/5 Pork belly chashu with lettuce and signature medium spiced buns sauce and mayonnaise): This was served messy mayonnaise was all over the buns. Overpriced for two pork buns $9. Pork belly chashu was fantastic though. I wouldn\'t order pork buns again here - go to Flushing for the $1 pork buns that are absolutely delicious and worth the cash.Whitman\'s New York at City Kitchen:-Cheesesteak (3/5): I\'m not a big cheesesteak person to begin with but this was alright. My friend ordered this so managed to get a few bites of this. Nice balance of meat and onions.Seating is limited but people are coming in and out. There are tables dispersed with seating against the windows. Other food courts to try out: Hudson Eats Food Gallery 32 Chelsea Market Gotham West Market and Urbanspace Vanderbilt!' u"Nice selection and variety. If I'm being completely honest I wish there was maybe a bit more options. Like 1 or 2 more stands. I know I'm being greedy. Everyone I came with found something they enjoyed and I saw a dish or two I will be trying next visit. Awesome concept a food court right in the theater district. Giving you a break from the usual." u"I believe this is part of the Row Hotel property but is open to anyone looking for quick service food.I stopped by City Kitchen on a few times on my recent nyc trip. Because it's attached to the hotel it made for an easy choice on a cold rainy night. There are a few food stalls ( like a food court ) where you can order many different things and sit down at either tables or along the window on barstools. The barstools are your best bet because of the view of the people and street outside.Best food options- Luke's Lobster- Dough ( for their coffee)- Ramen at Kuro Obi" u"My expectations were pretty high based n the reviews but this definitely fell short. \xa0The ambiance is great no question: comfy seating a great view of Times Square and a variety of seating options from benches to cafe tables to bars. \xa0The food is where it fell short. \xa0Whitman's kale salad was tiny and pretty bland with just kale a few raisins some croutons. and a few shavings of Parmesan - all for $7 which is a pretty steep price for a side salad in essence. \xa0The Shoyu ramen was very salty and also tiny at $12 with a very sparse amount of toppings; the pork was decent but the broth was overpowering with the salt level. \xa0The sushi was just okay: your basic rolls and with a $11-12 lunch combo option on weekdays. \xa0They do have a Luke's Lobster which was the highlight for me as it is a tried-and-true chain with a guaranteed food quality level. \xa0Overall it's a good stop to grab a quick pricey bite (for fast food at least) in Times Square. \xa0Definitely a step up from Dave & Buster's and Villa Fresh but go for the unique ambiance rather than food quality." u"There are not a lot of great choices to eat around Times Square but I was lured here by the \xa0Dough Donuts sign. I grabbed a Hibiscus donut ($3) which was good but nowhere near as fresh as their larger locations. I also grabbed a breakfast burrito \xa0from Gabrielle's. It was a decent size and fairly good though I was a little disappointed to see it was just eggs bacon and cheese. The cheese still being cold. The fried potatoes and avocado sauce it came with were pretty tasty. At $7.50 its not an amazing deal but it's not bad either." u'Walking around Times Square we had enough Pizza and Street Food. \xa0We accidentally came across the City Kitchen and we are very glad we did. \xa0The prices were a little high but the location and relaxing environment made it worth it. \xa0We tried the Box and the Taco Shop both were good. \xa0The donuts looked great but they were getting ready to shut down. \xa0I believe they close earlier than most places it was 10pm. \xa0I wish they had a few more options for kids the few options that they did have were sold out by 9pm. \xa0Great little place if you want to relax during your exploration.' u"City Kitchen is like a secret above-ground world. If you're vigilant enough you'll notice it amid the busy Midtown streets. Better yet just let Yelp lead you here. I was so excited as my friend led me through a flight of stairs until suddenly we were stopped in our tracks by a metal door. My heart beat with anticipation as she swung the door open. The whole place was so alive and bustling with activity. However the experience proved to be mediocre at best. There were very limited selections and much of the foods that were offered were not really appealing.Since my friend and I had taken the trouble of coming all this way on a very rainy occasion we decided to settle on tacos(Chicken and Veggie respectively) from Gabriela's. I stared down disappointedly at the meagre and tiny taco in the rectangular chinese takeout inspired brown box. Yes I am aware that this is Manhattan but I had just spent $5 on something that was barely the size of my palm! And it wasn't even tasty or fulfilling. I could hear my wallet crying somewhere in the back of my mind. There really needs to be more variety of vendors! I was looking forward to trying Wooly's but that was nowhere to be found. The only things that offset our disappointment were the doughnuts from Dough and the nice aerial view from the windows of the second floor upon which the City Kitchen operates." u'The lady checked if my 20 dollar is real right in front of me and found its a bit offensive:( the food is quick and tasty.' u"Stumbled upon City Kitchen when my family was visiting and staying at the Sheraton Times Square. \xa0My parents wanted lobster rolls while one of my brothers wanted ramen and the other didn't care what he ate. Luckily enough City Kitchen had Luke's Lobster and Kuro-Obi among the vendors! We were very hungry that day so we ended up each getting a lobster roll and a bowl of ramen...and split 4 Dough Donuts for dessert. My parents were amazed with how large the chunks of lobster were in our Lobster Rolls and we loved the flavor of the Kuro-Obi ramen. Can't get any of this in Hawai'i so everyone was pleasantly satisfied! City Kitchen is very convenient for a quick lunch or snack and is similar to Urbanspace Vanderbilt which I've been to by my office. Definitely coming back!" u'Two stars for the concept alone. \xa0I was looking forward to meeting a visiting friend here (August 10 around 5ish). \xa0As I walked in and started up the stairs I saw a sign saying restrooms were all the way downstairs. \xa0With the heat and humidity it was necessary to wash my hands before eating. \xa0When I got downstairs a little man in a black suit looked at me and said in a semi-valley girl accent that "Uhmmmm this isn\'t a public restroom!" \xa0I thought I had made a mistake and somehow this was some other restaurant\'s facilities. \xa0Nope! \xa0They really were being that inappropriate and rude; I guess assuming I couldn\'t be a patron? \xa0I promptly decided this wasn\'t the place I wanted to spend my money and said I wouldn\'t be eating here after all. \xa0The bathroom doorman seemed proud of himself. \xa0Disgusting.' u"Great good and a lot of awesomeOptions to choose from. \xa0It's fairly pricey but I guess that's to be expected in Nyc by time square"]
166.Adel’s Famous Halal Food,[u"$6 for mixed combo platter half spicy half yellow rice with white and spicy sauce. Didn't have a problem with prices like some other people here.Personally I think the quality of this food is better than the famous halal guys. The pieces of meat are good sizes and the flavors are on point. If you're in the area stop by!!1 downside is the hours. Can't swing by for lunch since the cart opens at 6pm (sometimes even later)." u"Let's get this out of the way. Its not Halal Guys.Is it worth trying? I certainly think so. \xa0I found the differences to be quite subtle and a nice change of pace. Everytime I come to NYC I'm pretty sure I eat Halal Guys twice a day (mostly because my mother-in-law forces me to and also because I like it).For me the chicken was a lot more tender and juicy and to be quite honest about the flavor of the chicken I couldn't tell you with any precision what it tastes like. Let's be honest here when we get halal cart food we spray it down with a fire hose of that white sauce and then maybe use an eye dropper to get that red sauce. For Adel's I found the white sauce to be good enough but not quite up to par with the standard and the same goes for the red sauce it just lacked that kick that makes you wish you bought a 2L bottle of ice cold soda. I did find the lettuce to be better here romaine instead of the standard iceberg. The choice of two different types of rice is interesting spicy or regular but isn't that what the red sauce is for?All in all if you're sick of the standard fare but not sick of shawarma and halal food walk over 40 feet for some Adel's." u"He uses romaine instead of iceberg. He has spicy or yellow rice.Adel is not the best in New York but he is by far the best in the theater district/ times square. If you want to do better than this you'll have to go to 45th and 2nd and that cart doesn't even work weekends at all." u'5 years later and I am still going to these guys. Much better than the famous Halal Guys. Adels has actual flavor in their chicken not boiled like the Halal Guys.' u"I'm pretty dedicated to the halal guys whenever I visit NYC but Yelp suggested this food cart since I was in the area. \xa0Super glad I tried it!Get the combo chicken and lamb plate on half yellow rice half spicy rice. \xa0You will not regret it. \xa0The meats are flavorful. The mix of the rices give amazing different tastes with each bite and the spicy rice is not that spicy at all. \xa0Just a mild kick. Less than even a cajun rice from Popeye's for example. \xa0Ask for the white sauce all over and get a side of the spicy sauce to drizzle how you like it. \xa0Unlike Halal Guys this spicy sauce is really good flavorful and not so much burn your mouth that you can't even taste anything anymore sauce. The lettuce was fresh and also came with fresh sliced cucumbers. \xa0Definitely a welcoming touch to such a staple food cart option in the city. \xa0There is also definitely less lines here than Halal Guys nearby but I will say that they can compete with the best in terms of flavor." u"I am a pretty big fan of halal but I haven't really tried too many different variations of the product. Recently I decided to branch out and try some of the other halal vendors (besides Halal Guys and Sammy's). I'm glad I did.Adel's is located right near Radio City Music Hall and there seems to be two vendors one on 49th and 6th and another on 50th and 6th.I tried the chicken and rice with half spicy half yellow rice. It has a bit of a different taste to it than the other halal vendors. The rice is a bit dry but tasty and the chicken is flavorful without being overpowering. I enjoyed the difference and I'm happy to add this cart to my halal rounds when I'm in the city.The only thing that bothered me about this vendor is that I have been charged either $6 or $7 for chicken and rice. I'm guessing that this is based on the vendor's mood or whether or not I need change as well as the more sinister reason of how much the vendor can get away with charging. I didn't see a pricing chart anywhere at all on the cart. \xa0As you can expect I'm not a big fan of this kind of price variation as I would assume most people aren't. I had spoken to the vendor that charged me $7 but I didn't get much of a response. From the reviews it seems like the real price is $6.Just as a note Adel's I would have rated your cart 5 stars instead of 4 stars if your vendors weren't sneaky about your pricing. The unfortunate and sad thing about this situation is that this practice is not uncommon in NYC which is why I didn't dock you two stars instead of one." u'Awesome food. These guys always had flavor in their food unlike the other carts. No long lines $6 a plate. Not rude at all. A must try for cart food lovers.' u'Update. Was in the City to see the tree.. 12/19/15. And had to get 2 to go.. finally enjoying part of the first and the 2nd later this week. Delicious. \xa0Yummm.' u"5 stars for value taste friendly and fast service location and quality. Must have: COMBO over rice. Get half yellow and half spicy rice. Get both white and hot sauce. You won't regret it!The meats (chicken lamb and gyro) are all tender juicy full of flavor and mannnnnn its to die for!!! You get all this plus a small side salad for $6.00!!!! SIX DOLLARS!!! I came back twice within an hour Cuz it was so good!!!! Enjoy!" u"This is known as Adel's food cart and its yelp page is hereyelp.com/biz/adels-famou\u2026Its got the best food on 6th Ave costs $6 \xa0opens 6:30 PM and is there all night.If you go before there is a completely generic food cart here during the day." u"Ok. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about these food trucks. But then I saw them everywhere! \xa0So I knew they had to be good. Right?My husband ordered a gyro (I personally don't like these) and said that it was very good. The white was key and the spicy red sauce was really spicy. On the following day he went back for a late night 'snack'. \xa0This time around he got the combination over spicy rice. \xa0Oh my goodness!!! \xa0It was spicy! \xa0But spicy good. \xa0They pour the sauces for you and boy do they pour on some sauce. The spicy sauce was well yes spicy and tasty. \xa0Of course the chicken and lamb were cooked good. \xa0Maybe they should let the buyer pout on their own sauce? \xa0Just a suggestion. :-)" u'Good lamb kebab in the center of NYC. Is IT worth 5 USD? In NYC for sure It is. I mean the size cause the quality is unquestionable. I willcome back here next time I Am in New York.' u"Was originally going to get pizza at a wine bar but instead chose to get something quick to take home at the last minute. I knew this location had great reviews so I finally decided to check it out. Got one combo plate with yellow rice and one with spicy rice. I think I prefer the one with yellow rice even though both are great but I can taste everything and still get a lil heat from the hot sauce. $6 each comes with a little lettuce and pita. This is definitely better than the popular halal Cart on 53rd... The meat tasted better it smells better! They did take some time to make two orders but that's actually a good thing. The other Halal Guys cook large batches ahead since they have such long lines so it just doesn't taste as fresh or as good. I'd definitely come back to Adel's... And also try their falafels. Even L who eats almost anything did not care for those other guys but really liked Adel's." u'Adel\'s could have had it all.What to get: ComboWhat else: Just because I said it don\'t mean that I meant it.I made sure I added lots of sauce so their gyro and chicken were "rolling in the deep" amounts of sauce. Adel\'s is "just another Halal Cart" on Manhattan Island but they have good combos. I recommend adding lots of extra sauce and enjoying it to the full. It\'s not as good as Sammy\'s Halal but it\'s still a 5-star rating for sure.A lot of people come here drunk so after ordering their food they fall to the sidewalk "chasing pavements" if you will.If we had something like this in Buffalo NY then people would see the true potential of food trucks. Alas.It was pouring with rain when I came here. But the hot sauce at Adel\'s was so hot that it "Set Fire To The Rain."I don\'t mind the rain though. I was like "let the skyfall" at least I have my combo from Adel\'s.It\'s nice and cheap too. Especially for Manhattan Island. It\'s comparably priced to the nearby Halal Guys but better. However nothing comes close to the taste of the Chicken Tikka at Biryani Cart or to the Combo at Sammy\'s Halal.Oh Sammy\'s Halal... how will I ever find "someone like you." I wish nothing but the best for you. Rumour has it Adel\'s is the one I\'m leaving you for. Just kidding. I\'d never leave you Sammy\'s Halal. Never.' u'Bought 2 lamb over rice and a chicken over rice guy charged me $9 each. I even asked twice and he said its correct.Clearly Adels is some shady scam artist; maybe he thought i was a tourist or something.The food itself is okay. Rice is softer and plumper than most places but the amount of meat is pitiful. The sauce is also lacking in volume and flavor.Tl;drThis vendor is cheap and will try to scam. 53rd and 6th is better in all cases.' u"Credit where credit is due Adel's is clearly doing it right. I'm a long-time devotee of Halal Guys but when my coworker on the night shift wouldn't stop raving about this truck I decided I'd give them a shot. So glad I did.My coworker and I showed up at 2am on a Tuesday night and there was an entire middle eastern family (mom dad kids some extended family) ordering food. You can't make this up. So we waited a while but not nearly as long as the typical Halal Guys line. Per Yelp recommendations I ordered the chicken and lamb over half yellow and half spicy rice. I was not disappointed. The gyro and spicy rice are clearly the winners. That rice definitely sets it apart from Halal Guys but the white sauce just couldn't compete with the yellow umbrella. It's really hard to say which truck is better because they are different. With Halal Guys I feel like I'm getting slightly *higher caliber* street meat but the seasoning on the chicken and the spicy rice are insanely good at Adel's. Adel's also gives you carrots in the rice and cucumbers in the salad - a nice touch. It'll depend on my mood I suppose!" u'This place UNQUESTIONABLY has the best Mediterranean food I have ever had anywhere. I went to this food truck two months ago and I am still DREAMING of the amazing taste from this place. The combo platter (chicken steak rice pita and halal sauce) I had was WHOLLY in the running as some of my favorite food all-time. I went on a school trip for a week in New York and I chose to go here twice.If you eat any Mediterranean in New York besides here you are making a mistake.' u"It's fine. \xa0I didn't think it was any different than Halal Guys. \xa0But I think I prefer Adel's to HG (spicy rice!)Bonus: It's not a tourist destination like HG has become so... No lines with idiots taking pictures of themselves standing in line." u'Stopped by here after a full day at the museums. \xa0I ordered the lamb over rice. \xa0I was given the option of spicy or regular rice I chose spicy:). Order comes in a rectangular tin with rice on bottom lamb with some saut\xe9ed onions on top and some lettuce on the side. Lamb was flavorful along with the white sauce. \xa0Rice was not spicy in my opinion. Overall a excellent dinner for the low price of $6!' u'100 percent better than 53rd! Food is always flavorful and you can actually use their hot sauce. Try the red peppers for an extra kick.']
196.Virgil’s Real Barbecue,[u'"Dammnnn! Those ribs and chicken meat did fall of the bone."Thats what you want to say each and every time that you walk out of a BBQ place. Virgil\'s did justice to the quality and the quantity of the food that was provided. I did not walk in for the meal but had it delivered thru an online service and I was very surprised at the fool leak proof packaging and the delivery. When my delivery arrived it was still hot and the package weighed a lot. Holding it immediately I realized this is going to be a lot of food. I had their BBQ ribs and chicken combo along with Mzc and Cheese and beans. Who doesn\'t like M&C right? But I was pleasantly surprised at the smoky flavor from the beans and it was a one up against M&C. I would definitely order again without hesitation and would recommend you do too. I have lived and traveled a lot in the south and I think I can now recognize good quality BBQ from the BBQ bs that is served elsewhere....Now enough...the reason you are reading this review is coz you want good BBQ. Your search ends here in this vicinity of NYC.' u'This is so sad because Virgil\'s use to be my favorite restaurant - I use to hang out after work at the bar with co-workers almost every Friday; and have eaten almost everything on that menu. I would take my out of town guests to Virgil\'s for the delicious BBQ. I have not been to Virgil\'s in almost five years and how the mighty have fallen.I visited Virgil\'s last Saturday afternoon as it was the 4th of July weekend and I\'m stuck in the City and wanted BBQ I was treated by my BF. Sorry Virgil\'s but you have gone down in quality and taste but managed to go up in prices.The ribs were "just okay" both my BF and I thought so - but the sides were a hot mess. Mac \'n Cheese tasted like it was yesterday\'s leftovers - it was somewhat like paste stuck to cardboard - I kid you not - and the collard greens actually had the un-edible thick stems/veins attached - which probably meant they save a few pennies because of the stems less greens are able to fit into the ramekin. BF got coleslaw which he said was tasteless. (He was hoping it was like at Dallas BBQ\'s -- which we don\'t patronize anymore but their coleslaw was the best thing on the menu.)Our wait person was nice enough to offer me a free dessert because I told him nicely that the sides were not good and he saw they were left on my plate. I ordered my all time favorite Pecan Pie (to go; but later that evening sadly even that was tasteless).Virgil\'s I would be so happy to give you my family recipe for macaroni and cheese collard greens and pecan pie since your chef(s) has just given up!I\'ve been to Kansas and have tasted the delectable BBQ served there! And this VIrgil\'s is a far cry from the good \'ole days or Kansas!' u"When we are in the mood for BBQ at the office we tend to sometimes order from Virgil's only problem is it can take quite sometime ... This past Friday we decided to take a walk & stopped by for lunch. Had reservations we came in & were seated upstairs  once seated we started with drinks  soda's & iced tea's not bad with refills. Appetizers we got the BBQ wings & the Trash spare ribs.Wings were very good  nice tasting sauce with a blue cheese dressing not bad. Ribs were covered in sauce  these were were good as well. I had the Chicken Po boy sandwich for lunch very good chicken after all the BBQ tasting the fried chicken was a good different taste  unfortunately yes it's fried chicken but it was very good juicy piece of meat not bad. The rest of the table had Ribs & Burgers everyone seemed satisfied with their order. As for the restaurant 2 floors not bad  pretty big upstairs with plenty of seating. Service was good & prices are decent." u'We came here on a whim. Staff was friendly and we were seated in like 2 minutes.  As a vegetarian i figured the menu would be limited so I got the vegetarian salad and the mac and cheese. It was delicious! The proportions were great I didn\'t even finish the entire thing until I went home. The mac and cheese was really good I reccommend it to everyone. For my grilled veggies I wished it was a little bit more seasoned and warmer-the veggies taste cold considering it was "grilled". No big deal though it was still pretty tasty. Also the watermelon lemonade is to die for! Will get that again the next time I come here. Our waiter could of actually visited us at least once to check up on us but whatever. The place was a bit busy the food came quick though like 20 minutes. A manager came by to be friendly and ask if I wanted a refill for my lemonade. I should have said yes haha.' u'Love love this place  went here with my boyfriend . The atmosphere was real nice  the food was awesome!!!' u'I\'m a pretty picky eater sometime and Barbecue is one of those things I\'m picky about. \xa0Virgil\'s has definitely maintained its reputable smokehouse quality! \xa0The Beef Brisket was great and the Macaroni & Cheese was awesome! \xa0Also had corn bread and potato salad which were good too! \xa0All in all this place is great! \xa0Good portion size to fill you up great service nice atmosphere and most importantly great food! \xa0They deserve a spot more out in the open instead of a side street.My tip here is to read before you poor! \xa0The red cap is "HOT" Barbecue sauce! \xa0And it is hot! \xa0Lol.' u"In a city that never sleeps and has people from all over the world a restaurant has to be on their game if they want to succeed. A place live Virgil's wouldn't be packed they way they are if they didn't know what they're doing. Especially considering that they serve superb southern BBQ in New York City. My friend and I came across Virgil's on our way out for a fun evening in downtown. Being from Norfolk we are always on the lookout for quality BBQ and decided to give this spot a shot. Virgil's did not disappoint. They were turning tables quickly and the service was excellent. I decided in the three meat combo with ribs brisket and pulled pork. All three could have come out of a classic southern BBQ joint instead of a restaurant in New York City. The ribs fell off the bone the brisket was smoky and tender and the pulled pork was juicy. \xa0I also enjoyed the house sauce. It was vinegar based and had a good spice. Our server was right on the mark and kept everything moving. I'd come back to Virgil's in a heartbeat if I'm back in NYC." u"I've visited New York City many times but it \xa0always feels like the first time. One thing that I adore of New York is the vibrant vibes of the city where tourist and locals collides. The city itself gives me chills and excitement but one thing that makes me more excited is finding a new place to eat. Its always a joy when find an expected place that blows your mind.I was in town for holiday with my partner and we are always up to searching for a delightful place. I love formal fine dining and gourmet type seating but I enjoyed more a family restaurant. I just love the idea of home cooked meal. Frankly speaking its almost impossible to find a sumptous barbeque in the main area of the city. Barbeque is probably one of my favourite food specially when its well properly done. My partner and I was looking for a barbeque restaurant. I read so much about Virgil's and its pretty much inviting. I'm no expert but I exactly know what's taste good. I was excited and in fact we invited one of our friend to join with us for dinner. I've set my mind not to expect anything but to enjoy the night. Coming in to the restaurant we we're greeted with one of the staff. I thought it was a good start. Luckily we don't have to wait for the table so we directly seated. The entire restaurant looks amazing. I super like the family seating; its a two storey restaurant but everything organized. The picture in the wall are creatively well done. The small bar located at right side entrance of the restaurant was definitely a great feature of the entire place.Let's talk about the food I thought the barbeque itself was incredibly delicious. The ribs were perfectly cooked it pulled off the bones. The pulled pork was tender and juicy. Overall the barbeque was totally a Rockstar.I hate to say as much as I enjoyed the food I was extremely disappointed with the customer service. I think the only person who greeted us was front desk. The server was horrible. I will say it again..HORRIBLE!!!THIS REVIEW IS GOES TO BARBEQUE ALONE*" u"Came here on a day in the city. The atmosphere is very lively. \xa0The ambiance was bursting with energy! The restaurant was full yet not over crowded. Since this is a bbq restaurant I wanted to try bbq. I ordered bbq ribs collard greens and potato salad. After ordering the ribs I was told they were served dry rub. I was disappointed. I believe that restaurants that serve bbq dry rub should give customers the option of dry rub or sauce cooked on meat. I prefer my bbq cooked on and onto my meat. The collard greens were flavorful! The potato salad was good. The cornbread muffins were served perfect and hot. Although I don't always do dessert I tried the dessert here and wasn't disappointed. The apple berry cobbler was great. The cobbler was sweet yet not overpowering. \xa0The crisp crumble on top was perfect. The experience here was great." u'A note to my friend who told me Virgil\'s was a "must do" in NYC: I am forever in your debt. My fully belly BBQ covered fingers and satisfied being thank you.My guilty pleasure: BBQ and french fries. I was told the "Trainwreck fries" were top notch. And everything about them - from the crunchy fries themselves to the crispy bacon and hot-smokin\' jalapenos and the melted cheese to the ranch dressing made for the perfect concoction. Note: this dish is not for the faint of heart all diet considerations must not be discarded to fully appreciate this dish.I followed this dish with the pulled pork - topped with house made BBQ and a sesame bun. \xa0And no indoor (or backyard) BBQ is complete without fresh tea (sweet or unsweet).' u"My boyfriend and I wanted to get dinner after a Broadway play as we're not often in Tome Square (too touristy and CROWDED). Went to Carmine's but they were booked up and suggested we come here Bc there weren't waits for parties of 2.Well we did wait but only for 5 min. They put us upstairs and we both got the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich as well as they corn bread. Corn bread was OK- just didn't taste as good as other BBQ places we've been to like Blue Smoke. The sand which.... TERRIBLE. Flavorless and I actually only had a few bites Bc it just wasn't worth the calories. Imagine taking normal BBQ sauce and watering it down.... That's what it tastes like. My boyfriend completely agreed with me.It's hard to get this wrong guys c'mom." u"The food here is sooo good!!! My fianc\xe9 and I shared the Pick Three. The portions are HUGE! There's no way I could have finished an entree by myself. The mac and cheese was so delicious!!!I would have given Virgil's 5 stars but two things didn't go well. 1. If you are showing up in the last 1-2 hours before closing do not go. We showed up about an hour before closing and we could tell that our food wasn't fresh. Our food came out extremely fast and the mac and cheese was lukewarm. The food was still really good but if you want the best experience pick a better time. 2. The service was less than mediocre. Our server only spoke to us once between taking our order and giving us our check (which we had to ask for). Our cups ran empty most of the time and other servers were filling them up. He was nice just not attentive. Other than those two things the place was great! I wouldn't mind going back for a big plate of mac and cheese! Mmmmm!!!" u'Loving the food and the Manager was great. \xa0He gave us appetizers to compensate for the hour and a half wait on a reservation.Excellent first time. \xa0I will review later after entr\xe9e' u"This place is just right across the hotel where we are staying so its very convenient. The price is slightly expensive for a sit down casual restaurant but then again its right where timesquare is and its NYC so expect price range to be higher. I enjoyed and definitely recommend their bbq chicken wings. I got their house salad which was a basic salad entr\xe9e from their menu while hubby ordered their pulled pork that came with two sides cheesy macaroni and black beans. He didnt like the smoked flavored pulled pork because It's just not his taste preference. It could be right for somebody else though he enjoyed the cheesy macaroni. Staff was very friendly a full bar great location. Overall I recommend this place for tourists who are near timesquare and looking for bbq food." u"I went Virgil's right before a Broadway play. At the time i went around lunch it had a good amount of people. As soon as the hostess saw us were quickly seated and our server quickly took our order. In addition to food we did place several drink orders that in my opinion took a little too long to come out. When our food came out everything looked great. \xa0The BBQ and the other dishes were very good. Being that is is the theater district i was expecting the food to be ok and the prices to be high. Virgil's Real Barbecue surprised me with good food and very generous portion sizes with reasonable prices. One great thing about Virgil's is that they give you a towel as a napkin which I think is a brilliant idea for a BBQ restaurant. I would definitely recommend Virgil's Real Barbecue to anyone in the area. I would rate Virgil's Real Barbecue as follows: Food(BBQ only) is 4 stars Atmosphere is 4 stars Price is 5 stars and the Service is 3 stars The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment." u"We made a reservation for 4 people on a Saturday afternoon for that same evening. They were quick to seat us downstairs. A couple friends were quick to ask them to seat us upstairs which is more intimate and enjoyable and removed from the bustle downstairs of Midtown/ HK.The food is fairly priced. The quality is overall good but it depends on what you order. The BBQ Nachos were a crowd pleaser and I highly recommend that you order them for a group appetizer. I had the pulled pork plate which was kind of dry.The service was average. I don't have much else to say about Virgil's but it was alright." u"My favorite spot for BBQ. I had a friend visiting from out if state. We went to Virgil's for lunch before a matinee. I made a reservation for noon the week before. It appeared the reservation was not necessary as there were plenty of seats when we arrived. Little did I know how quickly the place would fill up with patrons seeking food before the matinee's!Our server Roberto was so gracious. He was accurate with the orders timely with checking on us without being a pest. When the meal was finished the desert came just in time payment handled and time to spare before the show. As for the meal I thought I died and went to heaven. I had the smoked turkey club sandwich with Virgil's delicious fries. The fries are a huge portion. For desert my favorite peanut butter pie! My friend had the Texas \xa0Brisket Sandwich with the two sides and the pecan pie for desert. She loved it all. She raved about the potato salad and brisket. She ate the whole thing plus devoured the piece of pie with coffee!If you like comfort food barbecue done to perfection you need to go to Virgil's. Plenty of seating bars on both floors with TV's and friendly top quality service! You're right in the heart of Times Square close to theaters historic spots and bright lights." u"We were searching for somewhere to eat after a show and found this great BBQ place. \xa0We had the train wreck fries that everyone talks about which was super delicious. \xa0The ribs fell off the bone and the chicken was juicy! \xa0Great service. \xa0 My only comment is that there is too much food. \xa0Portion size is like XL but for the price it's reasonable." u"If you're a fan of BBQ and southern style cooking be sure to try this spot. Located just off Times Square though the prices are reasonable for the area. Service is great and food delicious- meals are generally simple based on shredded pork/ beef/ chicken etc with usual sides. Great beer selection to wash it all down as well. Inside the restaurant is comfortable and spacious." u"Hands down best wings I've ever had! \xa0I was in the city during a business trip and the hotel we were staying at was right across the street. \xa0I literally saw the blinking sign outside my window all night. \xa0My coworkers had been before and said the food was great but I was a little skeptical of any BBQ joint we would find in New York City. We ended up going in for lunch and I haven't been able to stop talking about it since. \xa0We went in for a late lunch and the place was pretty empty so we were seated quickly. \xa0The first thing we did was order the wings. \xa0They arrived at the table in a giant heap of smoked BBQ heaven. \xa0The wings themselves were huge but they were so juicy and delicious that I ate more than I would like to admit. \xa0I could have just had the wings as my full meal but I ended up getting the Carolina Pulled Pork as well. \xa0Amazing. \xa0The pork was moist and had just the right amount of BBQ sauce where it was flavorful but not drowning in it. \xa0For the sides I got the coleslaw and baked beans and the coleslaw was one of the best I've had. \xa0Despite how great everything was I couldn't finish everything in one sitting so I took some wings and the rest of the pulled pork home all the way back to Jersey. \xa0The car still smells like BBQ but it was totally worth it."]
158.Bar Americain,[u"This place was great but did not blow me away. Both the service and the food were very good.Recommended cocktails:- Kentucky mule- Old fashioned- Cocktail with gin St Germaine and grapefruitRecommended appetizers: - The grilled pizza was amazing it's a must-get- The deviled eggs were very good- The hot potato chips with cheese were also good and apparently their specialtyRecommended entrees:- Hanger steak - Mussels in chile broth - Shrimp & grits- Saturday special of Philadelphia style strip steakDesserts:- Passion fruit crepes were a hit- Cherry pie was very good- Coffee souffle was mediocre - skip this one" u'Bar Americain is typical of what I\'ve come to expect from a Bobby Flay restaurant. \xa0Decent atmosphere and decor good service and good but not great food. \xa0I\'ve dined at Mesa Grill in NYC when it was opened Mesa Grill in Vegas Bolo Bar Americain a couple times and even one of his Burger Palace locations. Nothing I\'ve ever eaten was terrible but nothing was ever mind blowing. \xa0My wife likes his tuna tartar that\'s been her "go to" starter when we\'ve dined here. \xa0I prefer the seafood cocktail tasting. \xa0We\'ve eaten the ribeye steak filet striped bass cioppino shrimp & grits and for desert the profiteroles and crepes. \xa0All the meals were done well. \xa0Just nothing to write home about. \xa0The first time at a Flay restaurant I like many other Yelpers expected more after my second or third time at a Flay establishment I realized this is as good as its going to get.' u"So good! Great spot for doing the whole dinner and a show thing. The hot chips with bleu cheese are awesome and so is the cauliflower goat cheese gratin. I got the pork chop as an entree and it was a little overcooked so I think I'd order it medium rare if I were to go back. But the flavor! The flavor was amazing! So so so tasty. It came with a quail egg which was pretty neat and it was perfectly browned. We got cherry pie for dessert and it was a little dry in the filling but the pastry was delicious and the ice cream tasted like straight up bourbon. Nice classy place. Plus I saw Kaley Cuoco there so celeb bonus." u'Very good food great atmosphere. We had...Tuna tartare - \xa0amazing!Escargot - goodEntreesSnapper - good but a little dryMussels - excellent!Pork chops with smashed potatoes - very good' u"Another overrated celebrity restaurant with slow service. My mom and I stopped in on an early Sunday evening after seeing a Broadway show and the place was pretty empty. We snacked a lot earlier in the day so planned on sharing a meal. There's so many good places to eat in the city I prefer to eat lots of small meals so I can experience it all. I would hope others understand that \xa0however I felt like we were judged for not ordering two entrees. Oh well! We ordered the hot potato chips and blue cheese dip. The chips were good but the cheese didn't really have a lot of flavor. We shared the lamb loin with quinoa and roasted veggies. It was a smaller plate but still more than enough for us after the appetizer. The lamb was a little over cooked IMO but the mint quinoa was amazing! The main problem was extremely slow and inattentive servers. We both had to ask twice for iced tea refills as well as the check. I would understand if they were busy but our server spent a lot of time chit chatting with another coworker. I hate when you go somewhere nice and aren't treated like it's a nice establishment." u'Excellent; really enjoyed this place. \xa0I had the "Snapper Florida Style" which they don\'t actually describe beyond listing the name on the menu but I ordered it on our waiters recommendation. \xa0I\'m very glad I did because it is incredible. \xa0The fish is crusted with thinly sliced plantains and is served with avocado and a black bean sauce. \xa0The house potato chips we ordered were good but the blue cheese dip they\'re served with wasn\'t that special. \xa0We ended up dipping them in the horseradish sauce my wife got with her lobster which turned out to be really good. \xa0We had the cherry pie and strawberry coconut shortcake for dessert. The shortcake was good but the cherry pie was outstanding. \xa0We\'d definitely eat here again.' u"I booked this place while on vacation in NYC because it's owned by my favorite celebrity chef Bobby Flay. \xa0Though my meal and the service was great I have to admit the value is poor. I had duck confit and it was delicious and perfectly cooked. Our waiter was attentive and enthusiastic. However my husband had the lamb and said he had better. My daughter had shrimp and grits and her shrimp were well very shrimpy. The price point is VERY high so we expected more. The ambiance is nice and it's a great location but it's not a place I would recommend or want to visit again because you don't get much for what you pay. Sorry Bobby Flay - I still love ya though!" u'The spicy tuna tartare and blue cheese dip appetizers were both quite excellent but sadly my daily special sea bass was super duper dry. It was clearly overcooked and seemed to be a waste of a nice piece of fish. At least the service was quite good.' u"I chose to take my family here to celebrate A's graduation but we couldn't make brunch so had mid-day lunch instead. I didn't like my grilled pizza at all and wished I got the Kentucky Hot Brown instead which my niece got and tasted really good. The burger A got was good too but I would pass on the sweet potato chicken pot pie and blue corn fried eggs too as well as their famous hot chips. What gets to me the most though is the lack of service for such a nice restaurant which may have been due to the late lunch at 2:30 but it still rubs me the wrong way. The waiters were never to be found and my mother had to use her napkin to wipe up a spill that my sister accidentally caused in which she eventually just took a napkin from our neighboring table since no one was around. Though A said he would come back I wouldn't." u"This is a nice classy looking place with Bobby Flay's name attached to it. We got the buttermilk fried chicken and biscuit garlic pizza and bourbon crusted pecan Creme br\xfbl\xe9e. The chicken was cooked perfectly but was severely under seasoned. The pizza was...and I can't believe I'm saying this too cheesy. The cheese to crust ratio was so off. And the crust was not yummy. The wait staff was fine but not really friendly.The Creme br\xfbl\xe9e was the star of the night. It was so good I forgot to take a picture until I ate most of it." u'This is a review for the weekend brunch. \xa0Like many other foodies I\'m a huge fan of Bobby Flay. \xa0Needless to say I was disappointed at my recent Sunday brunch experience. \xa0When walking into the restaurant the hostess greeted us kindly and was quick to seat us to a table. \xa0Shortly after we were approached by our waiter who took our drink and food orders. \xa0The food took 15-20 minutes to arrive  but the restaurant was busy at the time so it was understandable.When the food finally did arrive the plates looked amazing. \xa0I was really excited to try the food! \xa0I ordered the "big island tacos"- the taste was ok but not worth $28 in my opinion. \xa0For a top notch price I expected the tacos to be "out of this world." My father ordered a burger for brunch. \xa0When I tried one of the fries that came on the side it was not hot or crispy like you\'d expect a fry to be. \xa0The inside texture of the fry was also slightly gritty.This experience definitely felt like a rip-off. \xa0If a restaurant is going to charge such prices then the standards should live up to them. \xa0Maybe I\'ll have better luck at Flay\'s other restaurant Gato. Note: The food pictures looks much better than it tasted.' u'All time favourite.' u"Wow... Definitely a great experience! I am huge on service and wow.... The service was great here! The waitress we had was so pleasant the other servers kept our drinks full and our courses coming. The Earl Grey tea was amazing! The steaks were to die for...I guess the only downside was Bobby Flay wasn't there :) aw well! Will be back!" u'Why go here when you have a choice of a million great world class restaurants and bars all in waking distance? Only came here for a work event but I did not like it at all.' u'Stopped in for a post-theatre dinner here so the restaurant was pretty empty by 10:30pm. We had a great waitress who was very attentive!We ordered some malbecs for drinks and as for food we had the spicy tuna tartare to begin with the mussels (yum and really big mussels) and the mushroom and sweet potato crepes which are divine (more of a sharing non filling dish) the cauliflower gratin and steamed spinach.Overall a delicious meal!' u"For a starter we ordered the trio of seafood cocktail. Lobster and avocado crab and coconut and shrimp with tomatillo. I do NOT like cilantro which was used copiously in each of those. But the few bites I got that weren't filled with cilantro were yum! We ordered the Florida style snapper which was plantain crusted and served over a black bean puree. I got the barbecued rabbit which came with a kale salad and a corn pudding tart. The corn pudding in the tart really did taste just like my grandma in Virginia used to make. (-: For dessert we ordered the German chocolate cake with coconut whip cream and the passion fruit crepes. The cake isn't really worth mentioning except that it was surprisingly dry. The crepes however were great! Three crepes with passion fruit reduction and bits of warm oranges. I stole the coconut whip cream from the chocolate cake and if we were to come here again I would make sure to get that whip cream with the crepes! They served Illy coffee which was pretty good but we had been holding out hope that we'd finish the meal with some La Colombe coffee." u'Came in around 6:30 on a Friday night right before catching a Broadway show. There was 2 seats open at the bar which worked out perfectly for us! Went in with the intention of getting a couple drinks and a few appetizers to share - so happen we choose Bar Americain! We split the shellfish "Tasting of All Three" (our favorites were Lobster Avocado & Crab Coconut) Deviled Eggs Hot Potato Chips (substituted the Blue Cheese Sauce for Spicy Mayo) and a side of Asparagus. We left nice and full before the show. Great spot if you want to get a meal in the area. Definitely a solid addition to the pre-show dinner scene that plagues Times Square.' u'My steak was cooked wonderfully and the service was exceptional! Definitely great atmosphere. Never felt rushed!' u'I am a huge Bobby Flay fan and am disappointed to say I am not a fan of this restaurant. \xa0We visited on a very slow Sunday evening. \xa0Despite the relatively small number of patrons they still felt the need to stack one table right next to another.The wait staff was friendly but very inattentive. Want more wine? You need to get up find the proper bucket and carry the bottle back to the table yourself. \xa0The food arrived - the clam chowder and onion soup were both excellent. \xa0Unfortunately the main course was a disappointment. \xa0The pork chop was black the skillet chicken under seasoned and the asparagus beyond charred and closer to burnt. \xa0This restaurant is too expensive and too "famous" to not be better. \xa0I have been to a number of restaurants owned by iron chefs; this was the worst experience I have had at any of them.' u"Lived up to expectations- excellent service and delicious entrees. I didn't have the fried chicken but several (some southern) friends did and raved. The atmosphere was both lively sophisticated without being stuffy. I had the duck confit and it was excellent. Definitely a must stop on a visit to the Times Square/Theater District area."]
186.Hello Deli,[u"After a job interview I headed across town and got myself on the standby line for that evening's taping of The Late Show. It was then that I headed around the corner to this place. Rupert his wife and some of the customers conversed with me about my experience and couldn't have been nicer.As for the food I had the Late Show Editor sandwich and highly recommend it. It's a BLT with chicken cutlet and cheese and it was a great sandwich. If you're looking for a good spot for a quick bite to eat and a friendly face to greet you and make you feel welcome you're looking at the right deli." u'I remember eating at this place on a high school art trip.. before I even paid attention to who David Letterman was. \xa0I was impressed with the politeness and welcoming vibe I got from the owners.Today I went in and Rupert himself was there! \xa0But he\'s so modest and not a ham at all it was actually refreshing to meet a "celebrity" and simply order a sandwich. \xa0There was a huge line for Colbert outside but none of them seemed interested in the Deli. \xa0Anyway the food: good! \xa0A sandwich will surely simultaneously satisfy your hunger and satisfy your obsessive desire to eat at a famous landmark. \xa0In sum the sandwiches are great and they come out quick. \xa0Best in the world? \xa0No.. but sometimes you just have to go to a place just because. \xa0Worth a trip? \xa0Well if you know of this place via Late Night outlets then yes it is worth a trip because the food is actually quality. \xa0Very minimalist place and it is unlikely you will be able to sit down inside so plan on taking it somewhere else.' u"Stopped in here for a snack before a taping of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert not expecting much and was greeted with the nicest man you've ever met. Told him we were in a time crunch and he immediately started making us a chicken salad sandwich on whole wheat. Also got an iced coffee that was super super good. We quickly scarfed down the sandwich which was stacked with chicken salad and tasted great with the accompanying pickles and were on our way.This is one of those places that is a super tiny family owned hole in the wall that I'm sure gets most of its business from tourists in the area but the fact that the man behind the counter was so ridiculously nice and helpful makes this a 5 star place in my book. If I lived in NYC I would come by all the time to give this man my business." u"We were told by the Late Show With Stephen Colbert \xa0 production staff to comeback at 3:45 pm after the receipt of our tickets for today's taping. We were looking for a place to stay get nourished and keep \xa0ourselves warm while killing time and we get stumbled to this place . It is happen to be the closest deli to the theater and a popular deli with good reviews from all of the show's former audience members. It is a tiny place full packed when we walked in so we had second thoughts of dining. \xa0Anyhow we lined up to get something to eat \xa0and while waiting to be accommodated noticed that they are selling some souvenir items for the show. It has a \xa0frame of notable artists photos with their signatures on each. No doubt these people \xa0made an appearance to the late night show and stopped by. I remember that Letterman featured this deli most of the time of his show. Met in person Rupert . Nice person and very friendly. We realized how congested the place that \xa0we ended up leaving before we get the chance to be taken care of. I'll continue my review next time I get the chance to try their sandwiches. For now the review is about the place alone." u'Great sandwiches and even better people. I definitely recommend the Letterman sandwich!She was the sweetest lady that I have met in New York and made it a great quick visit!' u"Fun little place to eat. Not a traditional New York deli but it did the trick. (Carnegie Deli was closed and this was the closest thing according to Yelp!)The staff helped us pick a sandwich and sides. We recognized Rupert (the owner) from Letterman. \xa0This was the place Letterman would come sometimes to do comedy bits. Rupert didn't look amused but he was accommodating when I asked to take his picture.Fun place and good food. The staff was great." u"My first experience at hello deli was amazing! Rupert is awesome and the food is amazing! Get the Colbert! You won't regret it!" u"We wanted to take out from Carnegie which is closed for renovation. I needed to find something quick in the neighborhood Hello Deli had the highest Yelp rating of delis close by. Very disappointed! This is not New York Deli Quality. The corned beef was not acceptable the sandwich was small the potato salad was BAD as in spoiled. If we hadn't taken the food to go everything would have been sent back. The only good thing was that it wasn't overly expensive. BAD" u'Thought this place was terrific. I had an Italian sandwich and ate there at a small table. I knew of this deli because of the Late Show. Rupert was nice and I was actually surprised to see him there. \xa0Not real fancy \xa0but fast and a great in/out spot for a sandwich.' u"I frequently visit NY for business and always make it a point to stop in to see Rupert Jee and grab lunch. The food is very good and reasonably priced for Manhattan. Rupert and May are such friendly people. Very down to earth and approachable. If you're a tourist and looking to spot a semi-celebrity stop in. Rupert would be glad to take snapshot with you. He's always there. You may even get lucky and see Dave Letterman's guest(s) enter The Ed Sullivan Theatre which is next to Hello Deli." u'I came from out of town for a conference at the Sheraton. My friend and I were looking for a quick deli to grab lunch between sessions. This was the perfect spot: just down the street from our hotel prompt and polite service and delicious food. I had the chicken salad club and she had the honey mustard turkey. Both were very good! We would definitely come again!' u'Super cute place to visit it was the highlight of my visit to NYC. No one else online seemed to mention is that Rupert and his wife are genuinely excited to have guests in their restaurant and genuinely excited to serve you fresh food. After standing in line for various other NYC attractions for hours that turned out to be let downs it was a pleasant surprise to walk right in sit down and be welcomed in for sandwiches and coffee. Mr. & Mrs. Jee were happy and good sports about posing for a photo for me. I went to see Rupert but his wife was the highlight she is so full of energy and a very nice person "RUPERT POSE FOR THE NICE PEOPLE!" Thanks for the memory hospitality and the great food!' u'We ordered The Colbert chicken hero and the turkey/ham Letterman plus some sides while waiting in line for The Late show. The food was well prepared fresh and quite good. This is not one of the more famous deli\'s in town but IT IS a New York deli so all of the nay-sayers commenting on "authenticity" are all off base. Prices are actually fair and reasonable. Besides the good food the other best thing was meeting the owners Rupert Jee and his wife. The nicest folks \xa0in NY considering the volume of people that come in. I accidentally tore my 20 dollar bill in half and Rupert whipped out some clear masking tape and patiently put it together for me. My wife purchased half a dozen Colbert Late Show mugs and Mrs. Jee told her to come by and pick them up later so my wife did not have to lug the mugs around the studio. Amazingly patient and nice folks considering the amount of attention and gawkers. Would recommend the Hello Deli even without the show.' u"Had the Farmer's Club on wheat they included a small bag of chips.Very friendly staff.Sandwich was very good but let down by the wheat bread...just too dry." u"I didn't eat there so I can't speak to the food. But I've been a longtime fan of Letterman and I always remember seeing Rupert at his deli next door looking tired and nervous. I was so excited to see him there working the register! He had no problem taking a quick picture with us as we bought a bottle of water and a shot glass with his face on it. Other people poked in their heads to take a picture and he seemed fine with it all. I'm sure he's making plenty of money thanks to Dave! This is also the closest thing to a gift shop that the Late Show has. When you enter there's a small display with shirts and other memorabilia for sale. Rupert's even in the lobby after the show selling the stuff so that must be his gig along with the sandwiches. I threw a camera in his face and he obliged with a picture. Easiest semi-celebrity sighting in town!" u'I was in the area recently for a Letterman taping with Jerry Seinfeld and I had some time before to check out Hello Deli. I ate the veggie wrap and it was very good. I loved the friendly service. Plus being the tiny lady I am I fit right in that place. So cute will be back.' u'Great pastrami at an awesome price! I also loved the salad bar area and that they had lots of kinder candy. Overall really cute place with good sitting area on the second floor.' u"Sandwich tasted good but was on the smaller side and needed more meat for the price. Most likely won't be back--as there are better sandwich shops in the area for a better value." u"Wow -- this is the most friendly hole-in-the-wall deli I've ever been to. I'd definitely go again and again." u'Great New Yorker sandwhich. Pastrami cornbeef and swiss grilled on rye! Delicious withiut the bug deli prices..']
72.Urban Deli,[u'This place is a little gem in NYC. Super cute place and not super expensive either. Like 6-8 for a delicious sandwich. They put the deli in delicious.' u'Stumbled on this shop on my walk home from work on a Monday evening. I was headed for City Sandwich but decided to give this a go based on the Yelp reviews and I\'m glad I did!They serve an assortment of sandwiches and wraps as well as a few hot food options and a salad bar. It took me a while to decide what to get as a bunch of the sandwiches/wraps sounded good - I finally went for "A Bird" a warm wrap. I wasn\'t sure what the cheese and the staff patiently explained/showed me before I made my choice.I thought my wrap was quite yummy - the turkey (abundant quantity) coleslaw and Muenster cheese went well together. The quality/quantity was worth the price I paid ($7.75).The only small thing I would note is the turkey was microwaved to make the wrap "warm". I would give it an overall rating of 4.5 and would go back again.' u'Turkey sandwich with lettuce tomato pickle and mustard = $12. That is ridiculous. Sign says $6.50 then they proceed to say "you want everything on it?" "What is that?" "Lettuce tomato and stuff" "oh sure" apparently that adds $5. Also who charges extra for mayo or mustard??The $6 sandwiches are only meat on bread. Just FYI.' u'Omg! \xa0Super high quality super friendly and super convenient and super inexpensive! \xa0I had the Manhatten speciality sandwich and my husband had a hot pastrami with everything plus chips and a snapple...under 2p bucks. \xa0Plus the sandwiches are huge!' u"I go here almost every other day they're fast and all there food is fresh and well made. And very well priced for what you're getting! I love their turkey pesto panini!" u'An fantastic deli. \xa0New York size piles of meat for a suburban price. \xa0A potpourri of choices and accompanying sauces. \xa0Medium size selection of drinks. \xa0Very clean. \xa0They change their gloves often. \xa0Good seating with a view.' u'Awesome deli with great prices the best "bang for your buck" Friendly guys running it very patient with our big group of people.' u'Read the reviews from Yelp and decided to go here. The service was awesome friendly and quick. Price was really good and the food was so good!!!! I will be back for sure' u"Stumbled upon this gem when I happened to be craving something healthy. No one was inside but I took a chance anyway. I got the grilled chicken and veggie wrap which was just as refreshing of a meal as I wanted. The portion though not huge was filling enough for my lunch. The ingredients were so juicy and well cooked and the wrap only cost about $6 -- what a pleasant surprise! I also enjoyed their drink assortment (some healthy some soda); I believe I got a really tasty pomegranate bai5 juice. The cashier was nice and patient but not very talkative. The establishment was impressively clean! Will definitely stop by if I'm in the area again." u'My husband and I were out of town and wandering in the area looking for food. So glad we found this gem. Great sandwiches and really nice staff. Love these guys!!' u"Great little spot. Fast service. Just opened a week ago. Same owners as the Urban Market around the corner.I had a Reuben (even though it wasn't on the menu) and a large salad. All for less than $13.00. A bit on the pricey side I would say but reasonable for NYC I guess." u'Food is good but they do use a microwave to reheat for hot sandwiches. \xa0Service is friendly and the cold cuts seemed fresh. \xa0Good place for lunch but would not go out of my way.' u"My favorite little neighborhood jewel. Juan and the rest of the staff are great. I haven't met the owner yet. Heard he is Greek! \xa0 \xa0! Always fresh and very good. One of the only places around the hood that has Taylor ham! Clean clean clean is what I like and this jewel takes the prize!" u'Best deli in the area. Everything is really fresh. The owner is great and very accommodating.' u'This place is super clean and everything looks fresh. I had the herald on a roll -- roast beef cheddar cheese onions abd horseradish sauce.The sando was smaller than what I had imagined it to be but surprisingly quite filling. The roast beef (boars head) was extremely fresh and delicious and the abundance of hot sauces to choose from also made me happy beyond words.' u"I live around the corner and use Urban Market fairly often so I gave these guys a shot. I had the Steve's and it was great. Large fairly priced customized to order and delicious. Great sandwich spot. Will expand my order next time." u'Love the place. Clean. Quick. Affordable. And above all tasty. Their chopped salads great' u"Nick the manager is awesome! I come in here almost daily and have loved every meal I've had. Especially their breakfast sandwiches! Definitely recommended." u"Came here this morning for an egg sandwich and it was delicious. Only 4 stars though because I asked for over easy eggs and he made me fried eggs but still delicious. The egg sandwich with cheese on a roll ran me $3.27 not too shabby! No one was in there I'm not sure if 9:30 was past the rush but the owner was nice and wasn't too chatty (sometimes in the morning you just want a sandwich ya know?). Solid breakfast spot." u"Nick the manager is the bomb and this place is NEW clean and affordable. Great salads and wraps and eggs at competitive prices. Sitting area very comfy. I'm coming back! Immediately. Not many places with small town comfort like this left."]
120.Natsumi,[u"I was in a rush for lunch and stopped in to this place. I was told a 10mins wait for sushi to go--during lunch rush hour I was more than OK with this! \xa0The sushi was tasty (although I didn't get anything too crazy) and I would certainly recommend the cucumber rolls. It also came with everything you need for a decent takeout meal (soy sauce trays chopsticks etc.) and they didn't forget anything. Always a plus!In looking around the decor was very pleasant it wasn't loud and service seemed responsive. Would have definitely eaten there if I wasn't in a rush. Will return if I'm in the area again." u'I met a friend for dinner and knowing how much I love sushi she recommended Natsumi. The decor is really nice a bar on one side a hotel lobby in the middle and then the restaurant. We had:Tuna Tataki - delicious tuna with salty flavorful misoSweet Shrimp Sashimi - perfectTuna - deliciousSea Urchin - very tastyScallop - sweet and goodFluke - deliciousKymoto Oyster - very goodTamago - very goodThe staff was very friendly and accommodating. The sake was delicious and the waiter kept it coming. I would definitely come back!!' u"I found out about Natsumi through Living Social. There was a deal for $40 where you get 4 tapas (imagehacker.livingsocial\u2026) and one bottle of wine.Here's what we went with:Japanese fried chicken - this tasted like it was soaked with grease. I wouldn't recommend it.Salmon sashimi jalapeno (with yuzu wasabi soy vinaigrette) - this tasted fresh but it would have been nice if it was a larger portion. It wasn't the size of a regular piece of sashimi It was very thinly sliced almost like deli meat (okay maybe not THAT thin but you get the idea!)Maki rolls (crunchy spicy salmon spicy white tuna salmon avocado) - no complaints. It was good - just tasted like your standard sushi takeout rolls.I probably wouldn't come back here without a Living Social deal because the menu looked pretty expensive otherwise. But the deal was definitely worth it (especially since 2 maki rolls counted as one tapa!)" u"If you're in the area and you're looking for sushi look no further. Came in here before going to PHD with friends and it was a good experience.. The waiters were highly attentive and I'm pretty sure we had more than one bc they're constantly circulating which I didn't mind since we were slamming down drinks...lol our glasses were never empty .. Alcohol and water.. Plus in my book! We ordered the rock shrimp tempura the king crab dumplings and the sushi sashimi dinner set..Loved everything! The rock shrimp tempura was perfect! The shrimp were huge! I can see someone ordering this as their entree which isn't a bad idea.. The lightly fried tempura had just the right crunch.. Only thing was there wasn't as much spicy mayo as we would have liked but they did bring us extra per request so that made up for it.. I loved the king crab dumplings.. The way they look they almost reminded me of soup dumplings I really enjoyed them.. Very tasty and so light.. I can see myself eating about 35 of them in one sitting hahahaThe sushi and sashimi was so fresh.. As others have indicated in previous reviews they were very happy with the quality of the fish and so was I.. They were nice cuts and it also came with two rolls .. I wish I had ordered soy paper instead but whatever everything was up to my expectations anyway. This place is kinda off down a side street but still very close to everything that you need..call ahead for reservations.." u"What a great surprise! I didn't expect this place to be this great. There are tons of restaurants and places to eat and drink in one of the biggest tourist attractions in the world Times Square NYC. We picked this one because of the hotel peeps said it's a must try place. I'm so glad we did.The food was phenomenal the sushi & sashimi were very fresh and tasty. The food presentation was beautiful and attractive. The atmosphere was nice and cozy. it's a mixture of lounge & restaurant.Me and the crew were there for lunch and they were supper busy luckily only 15 mins wait for our group. The hostess was so lovely and friendly. The service here was outstanding.I had sashimi & sushi platter and Sea-bass with an unbelievable sauce that came with it so delicious with steam rice. \xa0They really worked well together. I really enjoyed my meal and the crew was very satisfied as well :)" u"4 star food plus 1 star for outstanding service! I really wasn't expecting much due to its location in the touristy Theater District but my experience here was wonderful.For food we ordered the tuna tartare martini green tea gnocchi and sushi platter all of which I highly recommend. Everything tasted fresh and it was more than enough for the two of us. The menu also had plenty of other interesting items worth trying. Of note things are a tad bit overpriced. The sake menu especially; we chose one of the cheapest options a 300mL bottle of junmai ginjo and it was almost $30.The waitstaff was friendly and helpful. At the end of the meal I only asked them to place a candle on a slice of cake to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday but they went above and beyond - they sang happy birthday and gave us the dessert on the house! An added bonus was how amazingly delicious that piece of chocolate ganache cake was.This place is definitely worth checking out if you're part of the theater crowd or even if you're not! I'll be keeping this place in mind whenever I'm in the city with a sushi craving." u'This is a really good Japanese and sushi place in the theatre district. My boo always came here with his coworkers on business trips and I have \xa0been here a couple of times. The kitchen is open late so we decided to come here after our show last night. We were able to get a table without any reservation at this hour.We ordered a number of rolls. But we started out with the rock shrimp tempura appetizer--it\'s tasty! The rock shrimp tempura is served on a bed of greens so it is also sort of a salad. This is a filling appetizer. We ordered the maki trio--you select three maki rolls from a designated list. We had the salmon avocado spicy tuna and crispy spicy salmon maki. All three were for $18.75 (not bad!). We also got the spicy soft shell maki and the "wolf hall" maki roll. Everything was really good and decently priced.Service was friendly and efficient. Our waters were always filled and the empty plates cleared. Food was prepared quickly as well!' u'After seeing the great views we were so excited to eat here. \xa0My wife and I left extremely disappointed with everything we ordered. \xa0It was very bland and everything we ordered was dry and stale.' u'We are so very thankful to Richard for extending an earnest apology for our experience in November and to Porche for making sure our experience last night was at the level all Natsumi clientele should expect.There was none of the usual obsequiousness businesses often give formerly dissatisfied clients. \xa0Just a simple honest apology thanks for giving their business another chance and a warm welcome to enjoy for a lovely evening.Our server was excellent and very knowledgeable about every ingredient used by the chefs as to guide my gluten-intolerant dining companion toward safe options. \xa0Service was very well paced properly attentive yet relaxed and so enjoyable. \xa0And it was the exact same service we watched every other table receive at our previous visit and throughout last evening. \xa0All staff worked together to create a perfect environment which left us free to relish every morsel of the chefs\' creations.The best compliment I can now give the cuisine is that everything I had last night (which were the same things I order for delivery) tasted exactly the same in house as when delivered; a very high compliment for any cuisine.All staff at Natsumi have truly set our minds at ease. \xa0We had one bad experience a few months back which boiled down to an evening of "off" customer service which every business is allowed. \xa0The Natsumi standard of service and excellence is quite high and they remain one of the best options for both dining and delivery service in the city.' u"After a seating disaster at Toloache we walked across the street to Natsumi and immediately had a much more pleasant experience. We had a warm greeting and were seated right away. Service food and cocktails were all very good here. Had the Ginger cosmo - just the perfect amount of ginger. We had the king crab dumplings miso cod spicy oyster roll spicy rock shrimp roll a variety of sashimi including the omelette snow crab and spicy tuna. All were very good. For dessert we had the Godiva chocolate martinis and the banana roll. Everything was excellent. Note - when you order the miso cod there are bonita flakes on it. They move around a little which can look a bit creepy at first it's only because of the heat from the cod. Don't be worried!Food tips: king crab dumplings spicy rock shrimp avocado roll crunchy spicy oyster roll omelette (tamaco) sashimi \xa0spicy snow crab sashimi spicy tuna sashimi banana spring roll (dessert)Drink tips: ginger cosmo Godiva chocolate martini" u'I came for lunch. The sushi rolls were good but not great! The place is nice. Good spot for a casual meeting or a drink.' u"I'm pretty convinced this is more of a 7/10 or you know better than a 3 not quite a 4/5. I was more pleased with the decor than with some of the food. The restaurant had a modern lounge feel with a nice bar on one side.The fish tastes good. I prefer sashimi or nigiri but I think this is more of a roll place.We ordered: Carpaccio trio - tuna snapper salmon:Good carpaccio. Each one was about 2 bites.Salmon Sashimi Taco: I liked the two small salmon tacos. I was expecting them to be in fried wonton wrappers but these look more like miniature corn tortillas. Crunchy with good salmon.Grilled Filet Mignon with shitake peppercorn sauce broccoli sweet potato tempura green beans: The strips of beef tasted like peppery teriyaki beef. The vegetables were cooked well not soggy or undercooked.Crab roll tuna salmon snapper white tuna hamachi yellowtail nigiri:Pretty good nigiri rolls. The crab roll topped with panko was enjoyable as well.Chocolate Mousse Cake - semi-sweet chocolate mousse over chocolate sponge cake with chocolate shavings whipped cream: The cake was not bad. Tempura Cheesecake - cubed tempura NY cheesecake over berry coulisA fried cheesecake? I ordered it simply because I was curious about a fried dessert. However I did not enjoy it at all. Another rare moment when I could not finish my food. All I could taste was sour cream cheese with tempura batter. It was pretty awful and the least enjoyable part of the meal. The service was pretty good. We were seated quickly and every plate was served in a timely manner. I wanted to give it a 4 but I just didn't like the tempura cheesecake. Good try being creative though." u"I was around the area and craving dessert so I decided to swing in since I've heard great things. There are two sides to this venue- the restaurant and dining area and next door is the lounge and bar. I decided to hang at the bar since it was an early evening and it was a transient stay. I give the vibe and ambiance 5 star. I came when they just opened for business so there weren't many people. Our bartender was amazing. He was sociable and informative. Because of him I chose the rising sun-gria. WOW! I normally do not like red sangrias but this one was amazing. It was a blend of brandy peach schnapps lychee puree mixed with juices. I love any drinks with lychee so I knew it was going to be good. Be careful though because this \xa0cocktail is stronger than it tastes. On to dessert....I ordered the tempura cheesecake. For some reason i expected the outside to be warm and the inside to be cool. I guess I was thinking of the tempura fried ice cream but I was wrong. The outside of course was warm and crunchy but the inside was warm as well. The cheesecake just melts in your mouth. The berry puree added the perfect touch as well as the blueberries that were soaked in sake. That definitely added a kick to the dish. I will definitely be coming back for more and also to try their \xa0 dinner menu." u"I've been to Natsumi a few times. \xa0I really enjoy their Italian-Japanese items on the menu such as the ravioli. \xa0Both the Butterfly Green Tea Ravioli and Tofu Ravioli are fantastic.Most recently I tried the gomae (listed as Spinach Sesame on the menu) but it was a bit off and didn't taste as it should.Natsumi is a great restaurant to get many dishes and share with friends so you can try their many interesting and delicious items!" u"Service was okay they were attentive in the beginning but once we ordered they were harder to get a hold of. I had to wait like 5-10mins to flag someone down to get a second round.Appetizers I recommend: green tea ravioli and tuna tartar were delicious. I'd pass on the spring rolls they were pretty ordinary.I got the toro sushi platter - 4 stars (instead of 5) because the sushi pieces were really delicious and tender but the tuna roll that came with the dish was sub par. It was fishy tasting and unappealing as a result. For $40 I expected more out of the roll which diminished the integrity of the dish." u"Orders Chef's special selection and Sushi &sashimi set. Fish was fresh. The garnishing was on par. \xa0I would love to come back and try other stuff." u"Fantastic quality wonderful flavor amazing prices extraordinary dirty martinis super personable owner and staff- definitely didn't feel like we were in the middle of Times Square. Left a bit drunk and praising Natsumi!" u'Natsumi has a lounge like atmosphere to it with an eclectic menu but this time I went for the sushi and rolls to catch up with a friend on a week night. They asked us if we had a reservation but even without a reservation we were seated and sat there for a good amount of time. FOOD: We ordered the sushi deluxe. Large pieces of fish and a good portion to split among two. Tuna salmon yellowtail spicy tuna roll all standard sushi fare but still fresh and good portion size for the price ($25). For a sushi bar the menu is extensive and very good! SERVICE: Standard nothing lacking but nothing outstanding. A pricier option in Midtown but close to your Broadway shows and other attractions in Midtown. Natsumi is a solid spot for a sushi bar if you want to kick back take in a chill atmosphere over sushi with a few of your close friends.' u"So glad I made a reservation for lunch because this place is packed! Came in at 12:30 for a 12:45 and they were able to seat us right away. Even when we were done around 1:30 the place was still busy and had people waiting outside. The inside is dimly lit and has a nice modern decor but the tables are close together so it does feel a little cramped. My friend and I both got a lunch box which comes with seafood tempura dumplings miso soup/salad and tuna/california roll. (They also have other lunch specials with sushi.) I got the salmon teriyaki box and it was surprisingly big. The two dumplings were a good size the fish in the tuna roll tasted fresh and the salmon was delicious. I was only upset that the tempura was cold. Service was quick but they didn't rush us to leave." u"The food is something special at this place. The fish is super fresh and of good quality and definitely something you should be eating here.Ambience wise it's VERY crowded and LOUD. Like we're talking I had to basically shout to even be heard by the rest of my table. Granted this was during the lunch rush so maybe it's a little calmer during dinner time. The styling of the dining room is very clean and modern looking with dark wooden tables and cushion booths for some tables. The food here is definitely a 5/5 everything we had was wonderful. We had the kind crab dumplings the seafood spring rolls a sashimi platter and the doppio toro. I'm a big fan of the doppio toro roll you can't really go wrong though with salmon/yellow tail toro. Beware though if you're on a time crunch plan your meal accordingly because after about 40 minutes we had only gotten our appetizers. If you're not in any kind of time crunch though the food really is fantastic and worth checking out."]
51.Otto’s Tacos,[u"I came in here last weekend ravenous starving pains of hunger after consuming half a bottle of champagne. . . . I had already been to the other Otto's Tacos location downtown but years ago. My friend and I decided to just get a quick meal as opposed to somewhere where we had to wait for someone to serve us etc. etc. Tacos here aren't cheap but they aren't insanely pricey. It's worth trying I think because the ingredients are really quality and out of tacos I've tried in the city more leaning towards the bougie side they're up there in the roster for one of the best. I went with one carnitas with green salsa ($3) and one shrimp with serrano crema ($3.50). Both are equally pretty fantastic and they hold a substantial amount of meat. Also had a side of masa fries that come with a spicy mayo sauce ($3). The portion size was insanely small for the fries but they were also more filling than typical fries. Nice texture crunchy but also not something I'd go out of my way to order again. I'm intrigued by the Gorgon. I guess it's a slightly larger open faced taco thing with lots of stuff on it. However a little bit pricey - $8-9 (which I can get a chipotle burrito for. . . .) Beer in the fridges for $4-5 its only Lagunitas or Mexican beers. Also they sell Horchata and Mexican Coke. Ottos Tacos is fun though. I can't hate on a place that has a mural in homage to Luke Skywalker's home planet of Tatooine on the wall." u'Took the long walk over one day after seriously craving tacos and I didn\'t regret it. Even though I had my heart set on tacos just reading about the gorgon made my mouth water and it didn\'t disappoint! One Chicken Gorgon and guac and chips later I was well on my way into a food coma.And the best part was hearing the epic "Drop the Gorgon" after my order was taken. Such sweet sweet words.' u"Really easy place for some solid tacos. So far I've had the carnitas chicken and carne asade tacos and enjoyed them all very much. Love that they use corn tortillas and not flour (a personal taste preference but makes all the difference to me). I just moved to the area and know I'll be dropping by often." u"Today was my first time ordering from here. I tried the Carne Asada and Shrimp tacos guacamole and chips and Masa fries. Two tacos were more than filling as they were STUFFED. I liked the flavor of the shrimp better than the carne asada. The guacamole was good but not great as were the chips. I prefer Chipotle's as there is more flavor though the guacamole here was very creamy.The masa fries were good quite heavy and something new to try. The sauce it came with was quite awesome but a tad spicier than I can handle. Delivery was on time through Dasher which allows a live order tracker to be viewed online and text message alerts as well. Needless to say I'll be ordering from here again!" u"I think i came in with my expectations set too high hahah.. but everything was good.we came to grab a bite before watching a movie. we got 2 soft shells (carne aside and carnitas). i would say the carnitas was my fav. the carne asada was a little dry.we had the mazza fries as well which were different from anything I've \xa0ever tried before. I would be nice if they had a variety of sauces that came with it on the side. I got tired of eating it after a few...overall would come back for quick bites or lunch!" u'Looking for a snack my mom and decided to check out Otto\'s Tacos over the weekend. The Yelp listing sold us at a 4-star average and "grab and go."Originally thinking a meat taco we were totally swayed when seeing a sign for a Brussels sprout taco so we each ordered one. One taco is totally not enough if you are hungry but does the trick just a fast nosh. Within 5 minutes our tacos came out nice and hot. The Brussels were fried and juicy at the same time. Who needs meat? It came in a fresh and tasty soft tortilla. Otto\'s is definitely a great spot for a fresh inexpensive and speedy bite.' u"My go-to spot for tacos; it's both fast and yummy! The prices average at about $3-$4 per taco. I got the carne asada and the carnitas both filled with flavor! I think it's particularly this location that loads the tacos with meat! I've been to the location in the east village and it was nothing compared to this. 2 tacos left me extremely full. I also got a side of chips and guac and they give a generous portion of guac (unlike Chipotle!)The store isn't that big but I went at lunch time and there was still plenty of seats. There's also outdoor seating!" u"This is the largest space of the 3 locations in NYC. I came here for a Taco Tuesday kinda lunch. It was clean quick & delicious. No line. Staff was attentive friendly & offered suggestions/recommendations. I got a carne asada gorgon (deep fried soft taco) taco with a Mexican Coke & it was awesome. I plan to return & try 1 of everything.I had to wash my hands & the bathroom was out of order & the employee Ashley let me use the sink by the frier - super nice of her. It's acts of kindness like that that keep happy & loyal customers - thank u :) see you again soon." u"Grabbed a bite here on a late Friday afternoon. The staffs were SUPER nice and welcoming. The atmosphere was so casual and friendly.I had their fish taco and chicken taco. The fish taco was so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was so good. The chicken was alright. I'm not too big of a chicken taco fan. However both tacos were served on a corn tortilla (not in favor of it). Eating everything but the taco shell gave me me a chance to really taste the flavor of the meats and other components. They were fresh. They smelled very fragrant. Best of all the taste was there. It was well seasoned." u"Otto's was nothing short of my expectations. After their debut at the Yelp Holiday Hangover with their juicy and flavorful Carnitas Tacos I had to get my hands on the Carnitas GORGON. A large fried cripsy chalupa like taco with juicy shredded pork(Carnitas) topped with cilantro Onion guacamole and crema. A Masterpiece! Smack dab in the center of Hell's Kitchen is Otto's. I met with a friend of mine from college for lunch and for a delicious cost effective meal Otto's was it! I read all the positive reviews and had to sample the Horchata Gorgon and famous Masa Fries. We were greeted by 2 friendly workers who were knowledgeable and kind. For 2:30 p.m. on a Saturday it was empty. We sat towards the back and admired the table space until more patrons poured in.My friend ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Tacos. I ordered the famous Carnitas Gorgon and Masa Fries. The Masa Fries are cornmeal like in texture and crisp. Paired with that spicy sauce! CRACK! They were salted just right and delicious. Its very easy to accrue calories at Otto's with such a menu full of tastiness. My Carnitas Gorgon was heavenly! A mound of extra juicy shredded pork combined with fresh cilantro onion guacamole and crema. A parade of delicious on your palette. I could've ordered 4 more and never fit into a swimsuit this summer. You must use a knife and fork to eat a gorgon. Its PACKED with carnitas and will break the shell.SOOO addicting! \xa0I washed my meal down with a delicious 16 oz Horchata. A rice flavored dairy drink with fresh cinnamon. An orgasm in a bottle! Perfection! Otto's reminds me of Shake Shack for Tacos. The decor is very modern and simple. Alot of light fixtures with simple bulbs and orange and purple. Love the little mustache face as the logo. I love Otto's and will be back!" u"Location: Once there's guy called Otto he told me that his taco is fantastic and I tried. And after that I knew I could never have another taco that is more delicious.Otto's taco has three branches now. This one is in Hell's Kitchen. I am lucky enough to finally try their tacos. Inside the decoration is minimum. And seats are pretty limited. I have not been there during rush hour ... so I cannot comment on that. The whole process is fast. By the time I paid my money I was shouted out by their staff saying that my tacos and guac and chips are both ready. OMG the fast service made me worried that the taco would not be as good as i would expected. But no I was wrong.Taco: the taco I had is the only vegetarian. I would say the size is pretty big so I only ate one. I love it. It was juicy and the taco is not stuffy. Their Guac becomes my new fav. Flavorful and balanced. And with chips it's only 4 dollars. WHAT A DEAL!Overall: I would love to come back baby. 4 stars." u"Nice little taco place in Hell's Kitchen for a small lunch or quick snack. They have regular tacos with a choice of Carne Asada Carnitas Chicken Mushroom and shrimp. For Extra $0.45 you can get a dollop of Guac on top if your taco (Totally worth it!)I had 2 Carne Asada and 1 Carnitas with Guac on my first visit ( YUMM!).If your kind of hungry and wanting something heavier and bigger. They have a Gorgon which is a deep fried taco that is much bigger than a regular taco! It is also available in the same type of protein as the regular taco. ( I have yet to try it)They also have Masa Fries Chips & Salsa Chips & Guac Churro Rice & Beans cooked w/love (aka pork fat) available to order on the side ( Straight from their menu). We got the Chips and Guac which was a good portion. It curbed our hunger well. They have a few beers available on their beverage menu which is perfect cause beer and tacos are the way to go!If you cant have a beer they also offer store made horchata served in a cute little bottle or some Mexican soda. Not in mood to try something new? No fear they have regular soda and water. Overall great stop for lunch and a light snacking during the busy New York day." u"Been to their East Village location before so was hyped when they opened up a location near my apartment. Decent size with plenty of tables and simple menu.Got three tacos: mushroom ($3) mushroom with guac ($3.75) and chicken ($3)...with a side of masa fries ($3) and a horchata ($2.75). Gotta love the fresh tortilla they use and the well seasoned ingredients - no additional sauce necessary. Masa fries were a bit dry but the crack sauce that comes with it is quite addicting. Horchata was standard fare.Perfect spot for a quick taco and reasonable prices. A few more options on the menu would be nice though sticking with what you do well isn't the worst thing." u"3.5 starsThis is one of the new places in Hell's kitchen (clean sign and interior). \xa0Since it was a weekday lunch and hell's kitchen is not necessarily packed with offices so I was able to sit at a table easily. \xa0Before sitting i ordered three tacos carnitas carne asada and shrimp. \xa0Also ordered chip with guacamole and horchata. \xa0Each taco cost about 3-3.50 which I thought are on the expensive side but then it is manhattan. \xa0I will suck it up. \xa0To me carnitas was a bit too salty. \xa0Shrimp taco was ok but I didn't really have the feeling like I am having seafood taco. \xa0Steak taco was not bad either but I would have preferred a more chewiness and more marination. \xa0Chips were ok and guacamole was really well done being very creamy. \xa0Horchata seems to be made inhouse which was pretty good. \xa0Overall service was fine and the servers/cashiers were very attentive. \xa0Overall it is a rather pricey joint but not a bad option for a quick lunch." u"This place is great for a quick bite! I stumbled here when I was living in Hell's Kitchen and i'm glad I did! The beans are some of the best i've ever had! All of the tacos are great and filling!" u"Found this place from Instagram and fell in love with the pictures. When we went there the owners and chefs were being interviewed but I wasn't sure by which station or blog site. I had the chicken taco shrimp taco and carnitas taco all with guac. Their carnitas taco tasted the best out of those 3. While the owners and chef were being filmed they were talking about a short rib taco. We asked if that was available to order and they said it will be the following day. Wish I could've went back to try it. Overall quality tacos!" u"Loved the food and it was allGluten free which was an added bonus for my family who can't eat wheat!" u"I really like Otto's Tacos and the new location especially needs a good rating to offset all of the people that are for some reason or another very angry about something and unfairly leaving 1 star reviews.This 3rd location is being billed as their flagship as it is much bigger than the first two. Most importantly they also have scenery from Star Wars painted on the back wall which you will see in almost of the Instagram photos posted here.They have the same simple menu as at the other spots: 5 kinds of tacos covering all the options you might want (except fish which they will hopefully bring back like they had as a special at the other ones): Carne Asada Carnitas Chicken Mushroom and Shrimp all for about $3 (guac is extra). I am allergic to shellfish and didn't bother with mushroom since there were plenty of meat options and the other three were great. Everything was hot and the fresh made masa tortillas here used for the tacos are some of the best in the city.They also have a bunch of good sides: Chips & Salsa ($2) Chips & Guac ($3.75) Rice & Beans ($2.75) and most importantly the amazing Masa Fries ($3). These are definitely my favorite thing here. Sure they were a little overly salty this time but they were still addictive as ever and are an absolute must try.They also have Churros which are perfectly fine if you are into those ($2.75 for 3 with some dulce de leche sauce).Finally don't forget to try to get your hands on the Gorgon their off-menu deep fried puffy taco. It's a bit of a mystery when exactly it is available so just ask for it whenever you stop by as it is incredible.This is an excellent new option in an otherwise not so great stretch of 9th Ave. in Hell's Kitchen. Grab a couple tacos and Masa Fries for a satisfying $10 meal and go a few blocks south to Schmackary's for dessert and you will be happy." u'Ohhh how I crave these fluffy crunchy delicious little tacos. I literally forced my bf to drive into the city just to get some of them today. I was first introduced to Otto\'s Tacos on the Yelp hornblower cruise a few weekends ago. Omg I\'ve \xa0been salvating over them ever since!! They were literally the only food item that everyone who I know that went on that boat was raving about out of all the vendors which were a lot!Anyways so my boyfriend were In the city to see a play during the polar vortex last week and we walked 10 city blocks in the freezing \xa0cold just to get these buggers! He hadn\'t tried them before so he had no idea what to expect **he he I popped his otto cherry** and he was hooked since then. We decided to try the Gordon carnitas taco. This was basically 3 small tacos in one. The pork was once again the juicest most delicious pork I\'ve had ever. The little home made in your face tacos are so delicious and a combo of puffy and flakey so similar to a street taco in Mexico. \xa0Any way they are topped with a "crema" raw onions (I skip these) cilantro and gaucamole and a side of lime. They are so delicious it\'s actually ludicrous how good they are. My boyfriend and I thought we could have more but we were wrong all we needed was one of these bad boys to totally fill our bellies with joy. We also split a side of refried beans and rice. It was honestly more then enough to be full for hours after. And for $20 how could we go wrong!!!! I can\'t wait for him to pick some up for us on Friday when he will be working in the city.. omg... I think I will try another kind in addition to the carnitas. I was also eyeing up the churros which looked muyyy Bonita I may add but was simply too stuffed to even try to eat those bad boys. Ps the gauc is totally on point as well!!!' u"Otto. Thank you for expanding your business into the wheelhouse of my lunch zone. Your E Village location had already put you at the top of my NYC Taco list.How do I love thy foodstuffs? \xa0Let me ramble the ways. Freshly made tortillas in the house. Juicy pork beef chicken and others I haven't tried yet. Simple preparation like I had in Ensenada and other parts of Baja. \xa0Meat onions cilantro. \xa0All killer. No filler. \xa0Small tacos but not over-priced. \xa0Excellent guac.I'll be a regular here. It won't mean you'll lose my business at your other locations either. You're the taco bomb!"]
140.CoBa 53,[u"The small appetizer plates have such great flavors and it's so fun to try everything new because all of them are delicious. The Pho is not consistent sometimes it's good sometimes it's very tasteless. Minus one star. You also have to ask for sprouts and chili paste which I'm used to always being included on the side." u'My boyfriend and I dropped in here a couple months ago with a Groupon. Our first reaction when we opened our menus was definitely shock at the high prices but I guess that can be expected given the location. I\'m used to comparing any Vietnamese food to the kind I grew up eating in Houston home to one of the largest Vietnamese communities in America so I definitely came with a bit of apprehension but I\'m happy to say the food tasted just like home albeit with prices twice as high (although the Groupon helped temper that). We shared a Tom Cuon which perfectly filled the craving that I had been having recently for spring rolls. But I was surprised at how small the order was. I guess when they say "small plates" they really mean small! I ordered the Pho Bo and added beef balls while he got the Ga Kho Xa To (Curry Lemongrass Chicken Clay Pot). The broth on my pho was incredibly flavorful and my pho actually came with a pretty good sized serving of meat although I wish there had been more of the sliced sirloin and less of the brisket. I remember my boyfriend\'s Curry Lemongrass Chicken tasting good but being a tad dry for my taste. It was also an incredibly small portion. Meanwhile my pho was large enough to probably be a portion and half. It helped justify the high price but I would\'ve been happier off with a smaller portion I could finish off. The disparity was really strange and definitely left him feeling a little cheated.CoBa 53 might do better to offer a small and a large size of their pho allowing for a cheaper but more appropriate size/portion. The ambience is definitely a step up from the pho shops I\'m accustomed to but I guess that\'s where the higher prices come into play. The service wasn\'t very good though. When we went there was only one other couple eating and it still took forever for the server to come by every time we needed something (i.e. to order for water etc). Overall the food would probably garner 4 stars but taking into account the prices and the service CoBa loses one.' u"Here's a timeline of my experience yesterday:11:30 AM: When they supposedly open.11:35 AM: When my friend placed a pickup order online that was supposed to be ready in 10 to 15 minutes.11:50 AM: When I arrived to an empty restaurant with no patrons or employees. It was clear that the kitchen was just setting up for the day and our food wasn't ready. Employees were chatting and on their phones not working. I stood there trying to get someone's attention but was ignored multiple times.Noon: When my presence was finally acknowledged. I was told it would be 5 more minutes. No big deal.12:10 PM: I ask how much longer it will be. The employee shrugs and goes back to his phone without even bothering to check.12:15 PM: I ask again because I'm still the only person in the restaurant and it shouldn't be taking this long. The employees laughs in my face and goes back to his phone.12:20 PM: A takeout bag comes out of the kitchen and is placed on the bar. I am told it's not my food.12:25 PM: My friend says she received a notice that her food is ready. I ask again if the bag is my food and am totally ignored. Like literally I asked the question and he didn't respond even though he was right in front of me.12:30 PM: I reach behind the bar and look at the order confirmation. It's my food. I leave in a huff.I get that sometimes food takes longer to prepare than advertised but I have never been treated with such disdain. It was really incredible. I was laughed at and ignored multiple times. The worst part is that the food was fantastic once we finally got it home and I would love to go back. But I just can't order from this place ever ever again. I see now why it was so empty." u"Came here with a couple of friends for an early dinner on a Saturday. It had just opened for the day so the place was really empty. Ordered the tofu chien (lemongrass crusted tofu) muc chien don (chili-pepper calamari) five-spice quail and the pork belly banh mi. The tofu was alright nothing special. The calamari was also alright nothing special. The quail was dry and disappointing. The pork belly banh mi was average and tasted like any other banh mi. Our server was patient and friendly as we were waiting for the last person in our group to arrive. If you are looking for a casual Vietnamese restaurant CoBa 53 is not a bad option but don't expect anything great.Taste | 3Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 3Service | 4OVERALL | 3" u'The service was quick but the food was dainty yet expensive. A small bowl of pho and a banh mi for $12.50 .... I simply can make these dishes at home for much cheaper. Not coming back' u"I love this place!!! My favorite dish is the Bun Co Ba. They're desserts are delicious! I personally love the cassava cake. I also really enjoyed one of their appetizers that's coconut based. My only complaint is the their portions have gotten a little smaller but the prices are reasonable. I tell everyone about this place. Highly recommend." u'Great Vietnamese restaurant with modern decorations good cocktails friendly staff and great food.We came here for the Friday all you can eat hot pot specials. The place was packed and everyone seems to know everyone! A great friendly restaurant.' u"Yikes! Avoid this knock off Vietnamese joint in Hell's Kitchen. After waiting for over 1 hour to get my delivery (and I live only a few blocks away but was too busy to go pick it up myself) the food arrived cold. Had that been the only issue I'd probably just let it go...however the food cost $15.00 plus tax and tip and was VASTLY OVERPRICED. I got the Dinner Bun Ga Nuong (lemongrass chicken with rice vermicelli). The chicken was smaller than a little cutlet and the noodles were dry and flavorless. My limited knowledge of Vietnamese cuisine would have turned out more flavorful food. It was seriously smaller than a lunch portion (definitely under 8 oz of food) and was completely devoid of flavor. I had hopes for this place since there are basically no other options for Vietnamese in HK...but I should have gone with my gut and stuck to only getting good Vietnamese food from somewhere in the Chinatown area. Gosh it was so bad..." u'I am a fan because of the wonderful authentic Vietnamese food and even more smitten when you account for the general ambiance and decor. I always look forward to eating at CoBa because I can count on a great dining experience - wine great conversation with friends and excellent food. No hassle memorable times.My favorites are the red snapper calamari and clay-pot salmon. Even though I now live in Chicago those dishes keep me going back whenever I visit NYC - which is soon for the Christmas holiday.' u'Delicious food. Decent prices. Amazing Pho. On of my favorite Vietnamese spots in town!' u'We heard CoBa was doing hot pot for dinner and promptly made reservations to try it out. I think it was around $35 for all-you-can-eat hot pot for 2 hours with an additional $10 if you want unlimited drinks from their hot pot drink menu (a slimmer version of their normal cocktail beer and wine list). Sweet deal!- THE FOOD:Vietnamese-style broth for hot pot was a great idea -- we chose their normal broth (very pho-y) and a tamarind-based broth for the second. Super flavorful compared to other hot pot bases.- THE SERVICE:1 star for the service -- not sure why the food was so slow coming out of the kitchen especially since we cook it ourselves?!* Made reservations for 8 and were seated at 8:50 without an apology. We were told we should have "told them we wanted hot pot".* We were seated with 3 cups of water for 5 people with no menus until we flagged down a server 10 minutes later* We never actually got a server -- nobody came to take our order or even gave us a smile. Instead we continued to flag down servers passing by for the whole course of our meal.* Drinks we ordered never came. Drinks we didn\'t order came often and the server would sulkily stomp away when we said we didn\'t order it.* "Unlimited hot pot" meant we would order from the server what we wanted and they would bring us a new plate of meat vegetables etc. when we were done with it. * They gave us a tiny plate of meat for 5 people -- we would eat it within 2 minutes and then spend the majority of our meal with an empty table trying to flag down servers for more food sauce water ANYTHING. At some point I suppose our basic needs were deemed too demanding for the wait staff as they took to ignoring us after a while. * And because we spent our time not eating and trying to get more food the owner kept trying to take our hot pot away \'because we were done\'. Overall we spent over $50 each to have a small plate of meat and veggies. Most of us went home and ate more food. I understand hot pot service is wildly different from a normal dining experience but I\'d hope they would have planned for that. Every other table were full of unhappy hot pot diners waiting for more food.' u'Pho + bahn mi lunch combo deal for $12!Really cute way of doing a soup and sandwich deal Asian style! The pho comes in a cup size. Not the best but good enough for me. However I was sadden to find a piece of hair in my broth...!!I got the bahn mi b\xf3 which is beef slices. Again not be best bahn mi but enjoyable. I really enjoyed the sauce they used for the sandwiches.My boyfriend for the traditional bahn mi which is cold slices of meat. Good good.The summer rolls were served with prawns. I liked how the prawns were hot and not the traditional cold shrimp most restaurants use. I wish they would serve more than two rolls though because the price was pretty high $7.50.Service could have been better and friendlier. Overall I would come back again for lunch. It is not crowded and rather peaceful. You get a view of the city and can people watch all day day long. The Straw hat decor in the restaurant was really cute too.' u'I really enjoy coming here. \xa0It is a great spot with great food. I enjoy it especially on a rainy day. \xa0Nothing like a big tasty bowl of steaming meat and noodles on a dreary day.' u'I had wanted to come here for a while and had gotten into the city early and walked to the restaurant-i got a series of small plates-spring rolls with a lime dipping sauce mango salad with shrimp spare ribs with crushed peanuts and shrimps in a rice situation with a peanut dipping sauce. All were delicious-I would recommend and return.' u"Tiniest portion of pho I have ever eaten in my life. Worst service. No water refill.. Waitress was on her phone the whole time. I asked to upgrade to a combo bc my pho was a portion for an infant's meal and it was the same size as the pho in the combo meal. Waitress gave me a hard time. Must admit.. Food was okay. Would not come back even if I work a couple of blocks away. Not worth it." u"Nice dinner spot. Great ambience and classy decor. l really enjoyed my ginger chicken clay pot dish - juicy chicken lots of veggies and the crunchy rice soaked up all the sauces and flavors. My friend enjoyed the pho (whatever the standard combo is called) with its delicious soup. We weren't big fans of the fried spring rolls appetizer - a bit too doughy and the ratio of meat to other stuff seemed off." u"After reading mixed reviews about Co Ba 53 and being some sort of a pho snob I was a bit apprehensive about trying the classic pho here. \xa0Originating from Atlanta where Vietnamese food and people are abundant I find myself constantly comparing Vietnamese food in the City to that in Atlanta.Co Ba is one of maybe two Vietnamese restaurant options in the Midtown area (Saigon 48 being the other). \xa0The decor is modern and the restaurant is quite clean despite the few flies buzzing around the place (annoying). \xa0My coworkers and I came today and there was literally one other party in the corner of the restaurant. \xa0The waiter mentioned that lunch is more busy in terms of delivery and dinner is busy for dine-in. \xa0I should also mention that there was only one waiter. \xa0Service was a bit slow we walked in and seated ourselves; probably waited almost 5 min for our menus and waters. \xa0Our food took at least 10-15 minutes to reach the table as well.**Menu online is out of date - prices are incorrect** 10/23/2014As for food my 3 colleages and I opted for the pho (small bowl) and banh mi (3/4 of a regular-sized banh mi) for $12 - we got the classics of both (1st choice on the menu for banh mi and noodles respectively). \xa0This is the best choice if you're craving both noodle soup as well as a sandwich and the price is actually very fair - getting each of the items alone (though full size) would cost a lot more.I read mixed reviews on the pho here and actually I found the broth to be quite decent. \xa0It's flavorful compared to other places - one of my coworkers actually said this was way better than at Saigon 48. \xa0The small bowl that comes with the combo is satisfying and comes with very hot soup and a decent amount of meat - add jalapeno into the soup broth if you want it spicy (I don't like putting Sriracha in my soup).The classic banh mi was a little more disappointing as there wasn't much filling inside. \xa0There needed to be more pate as we couldn't taste any of it. \xa0Still it is a decent Vietnamese sandwich just not as good as other places. \xa0The bread is supposedly Challah bread.Overall decent lunch for an okay price - ~$15 after tax and tip. \xa0If you want a Vietnamese fix for lunch and you work in Midtown hit up this spot." u"The taste is average. But what I want to point out \xa0is that when we checked out it already added a 20% tips and did not mark it out. I almost paid the tips twice which makes me really unhappy. And the waiter is always in a poker face. So I don't recommend this place." u"Great Vietnamese place for weekday lunch - the service was quick the food was good & reasonably priced. Went there on a Friday at 1pm for lunch and it wasn't crowded. The place wasn't big but but I liked the ambience - brick walls and the big windows which made the place really bright. I do have to say that they don't have a lot of vegetarian options but perhaps they can make it if you ask them.Recommendations: Grilled Shrimp Over Mango Julienne of Jicama" u'Good food. I Love their Tamarind Seafood Soup \xa0Eggplant dish and rice crepe. Dirty Windows and hanging lamps. They should be cleaned']
77.V{IV} Bar & Restaurant,[u"Food: great! Tried their house special Siamese fried rice and viv curry noodles. Love both. My sis basically inhaled the fried rice Service: For once I didn't get the typical fast paced trying-to-get-you-out-of-the-restaurant service. They're fast and friendly and won't try to run you out. \xa0Ambience: casually trendy at a pretty loud noise level" u"Not so crazy about the Decour but the food was outstanding. It seemed like there were trying to hard to do the AG cool vibe. It was just loud I could barely converse with the waitress.I had the red curry with beef it was probably the best red curry I've ever had." u"great place to grab a delicious affordable meal before a show/when in the area. \xa0The food I have had is all really great-I have had spring rolls and various tofu stir fry dishes. \xa0I have been with someone who got the chicken in some curry and he loved it. \xa0The decor is super swanky. \xa0I imagine people with love lives would like to go on a date here. \xa0I wouldn't know. \xa0What's a date?" u'It\'s my go-to spot for a quick dinner when I have a show to go to in the area. If I have a show at the New World Stages I am for sure going to V{iv}.I never had a problem with the service or the staff. I have tried a few dishes here. I really liked the Massaman curry. I would get that again but probably share it next time. I can\'t finish it. I even had a choice of chicken on the bone (thigh meat) or boneless breast meat. I answered "of course I want flavor please on the bone!" The portions are nice here for the price. There is a happy hour that lasts until 8pm. My friends were going crazy on the $5 Cosmos. I don\'t blame them! It\'s $5 during happy hour. Pad Thai and Pad Kee Mao (Drunken noodle) was okay. The Drunken noodle was better than Pad Thai. I liked the duck. Very crispy skin on the yummy duck. I want to try the Thai sausage fried rice next time...just notes to myself for next time. Is it authentic? No. Was it yummy and priced right YES!' u'Before going to see a musical on Broadway a few of yelpers and me decide to have what you can say was a late lunch or earlier dinner. V{IV} Bar & Restaurant is a nice and cozy Thai place that is located in the 9th AVE between 49 and 48 ST. \xa0Great service and delicious food. The staff was extremely attentive and quick we explain to them that we had a Broadway show to watch and they ensure that their server was faster without losing quality.A had the Pineapple Fried Rice(with beef and chicken) ... In a REAL PINEAPPLE!! Yes the rice was inside of pineapple making this a lovely experience. The portion was very big a lot of meat both chicken and beef and the curry rice had a good taste it was cooked to perfection. Both chicken and beef were juicy tender and very yummy. I really recommend the Pineapple Fried Rice with whatever you want to have it. Is really delicious. PS. I will recommend to you bringing cash there is a big discount when you pay with cash.' u'I LOVE VIV Thai (both this location and the one in Murray Hill). \xa0The food is consistently great the prices (particularly on drinks during happy hour) are super affordable the staff is friendly and efficient and the decor is very fun. \xa0Whenever we are in need of a quick Thai bite ViV is always top of mind! \xa0I highly recommend the pineapple fried rice the soups and the Khao Soi (a northern Thai dish which is hard to come by in NYC).' u"Good environment for a casual dinner after work. Darkish bar + Thai food seems to be trendy these days. Happy hours until 8pm so wine and beer was $5. Ordered Mataba for appetizer. It's like Chinese Lao Bing with curry sauce on the side. Their pineapple fried rice come with a half actual pineapple. Not bad." u"They forgot my delivery order! I called after an hour and the lady said they would start making it now and that it'll be ready in 40 minutes...no apologies...no free items. I cancelled the order instead." u"This area is full of overrated bland Thai food. Don't be put off by the marginally sleazy club-like decor. The Thai food here is actually really solid and there's some interesting authentic Northern Thai options on the menu. It's not quite as good as Pure up the street but it's also much less crowded.The Massaman curry was a nice spin on a dish that's usually 90% identical at most Thai places." u'Great Food-Great Prices-Great Service-a bit of a walk.... Walking to 9th Ave would be the only legitimate reason to skip this place. The Cashew King is superb!' u'I came here on a Sunday evening (6:00 ish) \xa0for my anniversary. The staff greets you right when you walk in the door and also inform you on anything that is going on at the time your arrive (happy hour and specials). Our waiters was awesome patient and fast! I ordered the pineapple fried rice with shrimp and I must say it was SO GOOD! I can honestly say that my boyfriend and I waited no longer then 20 minutes for our food and the food was nice and hot! I know some places that have the food served cold due to prepared but not this place. Also my food came served in a pineapple. . .awesome! The prices are good happy hour drinks are great the food was tasty. Overall we both were extremely satisfied.' u"I've ordered here a number of times for lunch. Their food is consistent and always hits the spot for me. Normally I call in a pick up order but now that yelp has an online order option it's made it even more convenient for me to order. Make sure you order from the right ViV location I almost ordered from their Murray Hill location. For the food itself you can't go wrong with the Kee Mao ViV curry noodle or Pineapple Fried Rice. Lunch ranges in price but it comes with an app which is usually two of whatever you select (e.g. egg rolls dumplings etc.). Serving size for the whole meal is more than enough to fill you up. Only downside here is the front of the house which is pretty chaotic when it's busy. The hostess is busy seating people getting pickup/delivery orders together picking up phones etc that sometimes she/he might miss seeing patrons waiting for a seat. I've seen people walk out b/c they're just standing there with no assistance. It would better to have two hostesses or limit the hostess responsibilities so she/he can focus on walk-ins during the busy lunch hour. In any case I will continue to pick up orders & avoid dining in during lunch hour." u"The staff and the ambiance are great but there isn't any wow factor in the food. The flavors are very light in regards to real authentic Thai food. I had the tamarind duck which was too chewy for my preference. However the drinks here are quite delicious and they were very generous with the alcohol." u'Awesome meal my husband and had the red snapper along with the pineapple rice the flavors was so good the fish very fresh well seasoned and the drinks on point.we love trying out new restaurants and will definitely visit again soon the staff very professional very friendly so i just had to give a five star' u'Man we really loved this place! Service was excellent and cwas delicious. I had the Duck Curry. Short rib appetizer was excellent' u"I've been here in person a few times and have ordered off Seamless a few times as well. I'm a much bigger fan of getting delivery from here - the food is always good and delivered in a timely manner.The few times I've been to the restaurant I've felt that it could be cleaner - one of my friends found a hair in her salad and I saw a smudge on my glass of water. Not super thrilled about that. Waitstaff is sufficiently friendly and the portions are large." u"Happy hour is all day on Mondays and Tuesdays. All other days it is until 8.You can get $5 martinis (pineapple peach lychee or apple) $5 beer or $5 wine. Stick to the wine (or beer). I tried a pineapple martini and there wasn't much alcohol in it. At least it wasn't overly sweet though.For my entree I had the sriracha noodles. It's pretty similar to pad see ew only they make it with sriracha sauce. It's not just any sriracha though. They use it as a base and mix it with other flavors. It's slightly less spicy than drunken man noodles which is perfect for me. It comes with chicken and shrimp and the chicken was not dry at all. It was a nice surprise since most noodle dishes that I order from Thai places tend to have rubbery chicken. But not V(IV)!Another thing I really liked about this place was that it looked like a trendy night club (minus the loud annoying EDM music and creepy guys eyeing you). Plus you can actually hear what your friends are saying and have a normal conversation without shouting!I'll definitely be back to try some of their other dishes (and for happy hour of course)!" u'This place is definitely one of my top Thai places to get my grub on!Service: excellent everyone is so nice and friendly here. Ambiance: romantic definitely dinner date worthy! The decor was very classy and the dim lighting provided a lounge like tone. The only thing that bothered me was that the spacing was tight but what NYC restaurant isn\'t?Sriracha noodles:- If you love your Srisacha you will love this dish! Yeah you can say "I could just add it myself" but for this dish it wouldn\'t be the same. They blend the sriracha in their own sauce base giving it the hint of spice and the flavor with its own unique taste. Pineapple fried rice: - An array of flavors both sweat and salty that gives this dish its pineapple taste. - They are generous with the meat and the rice is cooked to perfection. - The best part of the dish is that they serve it in a pineapple! GREAT Presentation!Overall: I would love to come again. Worth the price worth my time and worth every bite!' u'I love leaving a restaurant with my belly full and a Wet Pussy(Pun intended). VIV was everything I hoped for in a Thai cuisine dining experience. \xa0Smooth Ambiance. Good cocktails. Exceptional service and flavorful impeccable cuisine.I was thinking Room service but my instincts lead my feet to VIV. I recalled the Happy Hour prices being unmatched. I walked in the hosts led me to my dinner date. I inquired about happy hour and opted for the Lychee Margarita. My Margarita was STRONG at $5. I started to feel the effect suddenly. \xa0I studied the menu with a plethora of options. Decided on the appetizer "Masaba" A Thai version of Trinidadian Roti. Crisp. Flavorful and the red curry was rich in spice. If anyone knows me well they know i loooovvvee Curry. I ordered the highly acclaimed Avocado Massaman Curry. The flavors and texture were quite a pleasurable explosion on the palette. Smooth and creamy avocado rich red curry broth. Seasoned chicken. Peanuts and basil.  My friend had the Volcano Chicken. The quality of the food here is unmatched for the LOW prices. You\'re getting a quality meal for a steal.The presentation of our food was impeccable. \xa0The volcano was presented in real flames. Garnished to perfection. The staff was polite and friendly. One of the managersChampoon I believe was very kind. For moving our seat over to accommodate a larger group she gave us free shots of Wet Pussy. A grapefruit flavored liquor.My only con here is that the ambiance is not as breath taking as the retaurant a few blocks radius Room Service. The theme of the black light and large dragon should be consistently carried throughout the dining room and that disappointed. Otherwise I love the faux crocodile chairs leather seating and bar.' u'We ordered the $27 Red Snapper Lad Prik through Seamless (Grub Hub) and the description said "Hot and spicy. Deep fried whole Red Snapper topped with house style spicy & sweet chili sauce garnished with vegetables." When the fish came it was literally a deep fried fish wrapped in foil with the chili sauce on the side. No garnish. No vegetables. See photos. When we called the restaurant about the missing vegetables the lady who picked up would only offer a 15% discount and gave some ridiculous excuses saying delivery doesn\'t include vegetables. We argued that the website clearly states this and nowhere does it make any disclaimers for delivery then she offered to deliver some vegetables on the side and said it would take "5-10 minutes" (Do veggies not need to be cooked/heated then packaged and coordinated for delivery?). We felt the fish would be cold by that point and the dish wouldn\'t be what it should be. We had already waited an hour and were hungry. Then she changed her story and told us the vegetables were in the sauce. There were tiny red chili flakes in the sauce. Seriously? After these ridiculous explanations instead of admitting they made a mistake we asked for a refund for this part of our order and she said the best she could do was 15%. I called back because I felt 15% wasn\'t adequate because what we got wasn\'t even close to what was advertised. After a bunch of hostile back and forth including the lady rudely accusing us of trying to get a "free" fish she said she would refund the entire order. I told her I wasn\'t asking for that - only for this one dish to be refunded because it wasn\'t right. Then I asked for her name. She refused to tell me and hung up. I called back and told her I want the name of the person I spoke with or the manager because quite frankly I didn\'t trust her. She repeated she would refund the fish/order and then said she was the manager and refused to give me her name and hung up again! Later I called Seamless to tell them what happened because I certainly didn\'t trust her at that point. The Seamless rep called the restaurant and called me back to tell me he spoke to the same lady and she changed her story again and would only offer 15% and they can\'t enforce anything. They also sent me a $5 coupon to use on their site and recommended that I write a negative review. I called the lady back and told her she had agreed to a refund for the dish. She said she called the owner and he would only allow a 15% refund. And it would be out of her pocket if she refunded the entire dish. Really unprofessional and unscrupulous. Don\'t tell a customer you will do something and then basically lie. She did finally give me her name but I will not list it here. She also gave me a sob story about customers who call pretending their orders are wrong asking for refunds. That doesn\'t excuse the restaurant when they clearly made a mistake nor does it excuse her unprofessional behavior. She did offer a 15% discount for a future order although we have no intention of brining out business there ever again. We live in Hell\'s Kitchen (obviously from our delivery address) and get Thai food frequently. It\'s our first time trying this place out. It\'s a shame really but with so many other Thai restaurants around Pure Wondee Siam @Nine Pam\'s... we definitely won\'t try V{IV} again and don\'t recommend it to others. The food was nothing special and mediocre at best.']
208.Maria Pia,[u'Been to Maria Pia last Saturday night very bussy place we did not have resvtion but they take care is right way Food outstanding order fettuccini musles clams lobster Very very good desert banana tart best ever Good job Maria Pia' u"This is my new go to place for a great Italian meal. The service is well-coordinated and a nice quiet space-well except for the table of women celebrating their birthday but it wasn't a turn-off.The drinks are strong and they will make something up for you if you simply want something different.The food was excellent and filling as I had the seafood pasta-with lobster mussels and shrimp-all fresh!If you're looking for a small intimate space-this is it!" u"Recently returned for a delicious Italian dinner with family and friends. I had the lamb shank (without sauce and spinach instead of lentils due to a low carb high fat diet prescribed by a neurologist.) The waitstaff were very understanding about my dietary restrictions and seemed kind and patient. It was quite dark and a bit noisy but not to the extent where you can't hear anyone else talking." u'We have only been to NYC twice and we can to Maria Pia both times. Every item we have ordered has been superb. The service and location is also excellent- particularly if you are going to a show. We will come back again.' u'Good all round Italian place. We went here for dinner and the food was quite good. A friend ordered the spaghetti arrabiata which was cooked well and the sauce was flavorful. My fish special was a halibut filet which was perfectly cooked and the accompanying white wine sauce was delicious.Overall solid food and good service. Would come back here again.' u"This is a very good reasonably priced restaurant in NYC. \xa0You will find a nice ambiance eager to please servers and good quality food. \xa0They offer some specials which include appetizer entree and dessert. \xa0I have never been disappointed coming here. \xa0 They also have a very very good wine list!The reason for the 3 stars is only because there are so many great restaurants in NYC. \xa0This is more of your typical fare not fancy recipes or presentations. \xa0Don't hesitate to eat here." u'Nice service good food great dessert.' u'I have had nothing but great food and service there. Was just there the other day about my fourth time. \xa0It is like others have said \xa0my "go to" \xa0place when visiting NYC. Close to Times Square but far enough away!.... importantly.. where the local go!' u"Everything was pretty good except the mussels appetizers. I order mussels regularly when out to dinner and these were by far the worst I've ever had. The sauce was watery and the mussels were so tiny. We didn't even finish the appetizer because they were so lackluster." u"cozy charming and fantastic food. \xa0highly recommend the homemade pasta fungi. \xa0better than italy! \xa0 you will not be disappointed! and i'm a pasta foodie critic." u"I had a good but not ravable experience here. The food was good. It didn't wow me but I couldn't complain either. The service was great and the ambiance is nice - not loud and you can have a conversation.I can only give 3 stars because it really smells like old people inside and I couldn't get away from it. When I bit into my delicious bread- I smelled it. Sipping wine- smelled it. My marsala arrived- smelled it. I can't describe this In detail without being offensive so please check it out yourself!!!!!!!!" u'This is a great place. The service is great. The food is delicious. And it is quite reasonable for ambience and service and food combined. We were a loud and large group. They accommodated is quite well. I broke a glass and our waitress said " it\'s for good luck" and gave us free desserts !!' u"Did lunch here a few days ago with my co-workers. We have some people in our group with health restrictions and this place had some options that would fit all of our needs. The menu is ample and they do a pre-fixe lunch special for $15. Though we all decided to order off of the normal menu. I had Tortellini Dell Nonna while everyone else had Chicken Parm Chicken Marsala and Rigatoni Alla Butera. The filling of mine and the sauce was great but the pasta was a little tough for my liking.Service was pretty good. They refilled waters regularly and checked in every so often. The ambiance was great too. Overall a good place but slightly pricey for what you get and not the best Italian i've ever had." u"We ended up at Maria Pia's when we couldn't get in next door and were so glad we did. Everything was delicious including the branzino the osso buco the ravioli and the pasta with sausage. Burrata appetizers were delicious too. Servers were really nice. Just a perfect neighborhood restaurant. I'm sure we'll be back." u'Ok this is gross so prepare. My mother and I went here for dinner on Saturday night and we arrived a bot early and were seated at the table to wait for my brother and sis-in-law.The waiter greeted us and the bread was brought to our table. I put my hand in the bread basket and felt something cold and wet and kind of slimy.4 greasy shrimp tails were in my hand. Obviously the server or whomever had taken the bread off of another table where someone was eating their shrimp scampi and throwing the tails INTO the bread basket. ( so many wrongs happening here) This was terrible but what happened next just made it worse. We told our waiter and since we had to await my brother\'s arrival we sat there for almost 10 minutes and NO ONE CAME OVER TO SAY ANYTHING. I told my brother what was in the bread basket and he was like "We are leaving that is so gross." Then he mentioned that when he was in college and working at Olive Garden all staff was told NEVER to re-use bread baskets from other tables. The Olive Garden. This place with 25-30 dollar entrees has the nerve to do this and not even come over and say "Hey we are sorry that was a mistake on our part."Greasy shrimp tails in the bread basket. I cant. so gross.' u'I just moved to the city 2 months ago. All I can say is their food is phenomenal. One of my favorite Italian food in the city.' u'Thoroughly enjoyed lunch here with my son 16 prior to seeing Wicked down the block. There is a prix fixed menu at $16 each but what we wanted wasn\'t part of that. We started with calamari and zucchini frita which were lightly fried and tender. My son then had chicken Parmesan which was pounded thin and was light and flavorful. I had the homemade fettuccine con funghi (mushrooms) with garlic oil and herbs also light and delicious! I had a crisp glass of Gavi which was the perfect accompaniment. For dessert my son enjoyed a banana tart which he loved. For myself the chocolate souffl\xe9 with hazelnut gelato did the trick of course with cappuccino. When on West 51st street be sure to stop by for a nice Italian meal at Maria Pia\'s. You\'ll walk out singing "That\'s Amore!"' u"I have been to Maria Pia about 6 times and it never disappoints. \xa0The service is attentive without being pushy. \xa0I took my aunt and uncle here on a Friday for a 6:30 reservation. \xa0When the owner noticed we are sort of cramped in a corner he immediately came out and moved us to a much better table. \xa0The food is wonderful. \xa0I always get the butera which is out of this world and a very good sized Cesar salad. \xa0Dessert was the tartufo and the profiteroles.I had a very nice rose' with dinner and we were treated to a lemoncello following our meal. \xa0I am big fan and will definitely be back." u"Simply one of my favorite restaurants. \xa0The chefs creations are inventive and tasty. \xa0The special appetizer of fried zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta cheese and served on a bed of arugula and tomatoes. For the main course the pan seared cod fish is my favorite. It's served with polenta and grilled asparagus and finished with a shallot ginger sauce. Sooo good! Friendly staff and great wines too!" u"Maria Pia is a reasonably price mid-scale Italian restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. The food was decent but I didn't like the ambiance too much...dining here made me feel like I was in a basement. I had the Risotto Fruitti de Mare. Even though the risotto was tomato-based it had a bit of creamy taste. The risotto had shrimp mussels and clams but mostly arborio rice which was cooked quite nicely."]
92.Aureole,[u"I came to Aureole - The Liberty Room for Restaurant Week. \xa0And overall my experience was average. \xa0In my opinion the food was ok not bad but honestly a little disappointing for a michelin starred restaurant. We had the Tuna Tartare which was a little tasteless and the Cavatelli to start. \xa0The Cavatelli and the Lamb dish were actually superb and very flavorful. The Lamb didn't need a knife to cut - it was so soft and tender it I could easily split it apart with my fork.The Hake could have used some serious seasoning - but the snap pea wasabi sauce that came with it was delicious. The desserts were good. \xa0If you are a chocolate or coconut fan I would recommend the Chocolate dessert option (I forget what they called it) otherwise the Blueberry dessert is also a great lighter in flavor option. (The mixed berry sorbet was delicious) What truly impressed me here was the service. \xa0The waitstaff is truly amazing and accommodating. \xa0The waitstaff is what gave this review 4 stars instead of three. \xa0They turned my ho-hum food experience into a great overall dining experience. Also a good note is that the wine list at this restaurant is BEYOND huge. \xa0I would have assumed that they have every wine you could even think of - over 25 pages of wine options! (Albeit very expensive wine options) I most likely won't be coming back honestly I won't pay full price (outside of restaurant week) for the food unfortunately." u"I came here to try their Restaurant Week lunch menu and I can't say I was impressed food and service alike. For starters I got the Cavatelli Pasta and my friend got the Yellowfin Tuna. The pasta was big enough to be an entree. I shared it with a friend and we still couldn't finish it partly due to the fact that it was heavy too. On the contrary the Yellowfin Tuna was light and refreshing. For the entree I got the Poached Hake and my friend got the Slow Roasted Lamb. The Hake (fish) was SO DELICIOUS. I'm usually not a fan of horseradish but it compliments this dish so well! I don't think I would give it up for anything. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish. For desserts I got the Blueberry Mille-Feuille and my friend got the Chocolate Genoise. The Chocolate Genoise was SO SO GOOD I regret getting the Mille-Feuille. While most chocolate desserts are sweet to the point you'd think you'll get a heart attack the Genoise was PERFECTION. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT. The Mille-Feuille on the other hand was a disaster. Please don't get it unless you like eating tasteless puff pastry that easily falls apart... Not to mention the mixed berry sorbet tastes like cough medicine. ECK.Other than the Chocolate Genoise I have no reason to come back to this restaurant. Service was great until most of the staff went on break... We waited an hour for the dessert to come... Not to mention there was no one left to clear our table or fill our cups... It was kind of ridiculous. Management should really consider making changes to staff arrangements. Perhaps have one or two staff start later than others so there's still SOMEONE to take care of your customers?" u"Joining the army of new york foodies during restaurant week I ventured out to times square area to look for this Michelin one star restaurant on a friday night (oh boy the traffic and crowd were insane at times square!) Arriving at the restaurant around 8pm I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of asian customers at the restaurant. If it were not for the decor of the restaurant I'd have thought I went to a Chinese restaurant instead. I didn't wait for long before getting seated by the bar and being presented the same restaurant week menu as did people sitting at the table. The $42 prefix dinner includes two courses and one dessert for you to choose from three categories. I chose Yellowfin Tuna for my first course Farro Risotto for the second course and Chocolate Genoise as dessert. Before your food arrives feel free to ask your waiter/waitress to bring you some bread with butter if you're starving as I was. The presentation of all the dishes was spectacular each one looking better than the previous one. When it comes to tastes I liked the first course Yellowfin Tuna which tasted very fresh and flavorful. With \xa0thinly-sliced cucumbers laid around the pink tuna the dish definitely created a palatable color combination that seemed appetizing. I was slightly disappointed by the second dish Farro Risotto because I was expecting the fish to be much more fresh and tender. I would recommend that you order Slow Roasted Lamb if you have a high standard for fish quality as I do. My friend who ordered slow roasted lamb shared some of his lamb with me; the lamb was amazing: tender juicy and flavorful! I was not too impressed by the dessert; it was alright. All in all I enjoyed my meal here and liked the decor of Aurelo a lot!" u"This review is for restaurant week!! First course: Summer greens. Yellowfin tuna. Cavatili Pasta. The summer greens was surprisingly good. They have a good sauce that comes with it. Also a hefty portion. Tuna was delish. A smaller portion but good raw tuna ceviche type dish. The cavatili pasta has a strong pesto flavor.Second course: Purple Hake. Risotto. Slow cooked lamb. Hake is a fish on a bed of taro. More of a lighter palate. Risotto was interesting. Had a strong base of goat cheese and zucchini. The lamb is rich and savory. The couscous that came with it was yummy and rich in flavor too!Dessert: blueberry Mille-fueille. Chocolate genoise. The Mille-fueille wasn't what I was expecting. Thought it was going to be a thousand layer crepe cake but it was more of a thin flakey sandwich with Creme in the middle. I loved the genoise! It's mostly a chocolate dessert with coconut sorbet!" u'Great spot between time square and Bryant Park chic casual and upscale dining. They have prefix menu or you can go a la carte. Michelin Star Che Charlie Palmer resto you can try without breaking your bank. Food and service were both excellent however my fish did have a bone or two so becareful with fish. Slightly salty for my taste but that probably fine for others. Hake (fish) was excellent!!' u"I took my mom here for the prix fixe Mother's Day brunch and it was a huge hit! Unlike typical prix fixe menus there were tons of different options for every type of palate. I was a little miffed that we (and everyone else who had reservations for 11:45AM) had to wait around for 10-15 minute while they completed setting up the dining area so we ended up not being seated until around 12PM. I thought the point of making reservations was so that this wouldn't be a problem. Good thing we had no plans following brunch.For our appetizers we ordered the white asparagus soup and the whitefin tuna tartare. Both were excellent options. The soup was creamy and tasted almost like seafood chowder The tuna tartare was super fresh and nicely marinated in a light dressing of soysauce? and sesame oil. I particularly enjoyed the vegetable topping which was dusted with a light chili paste and tasted like fresh kimchi. For our main courses we ordered the steak with potatoes and the lobster benedict. I really enjoyed the lobster benedict. It was definitely way too much food for one person - which the server did warn me about before I ordered it - so I was glad that I shared it with my mom. In addition to the lobster (I think all together it was a full lobster bc I had two half tails and two claws) I also got a little cut of steak. The steak was a bit bland and was more a medium rare than a rare which I'd asked for but I rolled it around in my mom's steak sauce and it was fine. My mom found her steak which had a salt and pepper crust to be a little too salty. Otherwise her steak was cooked to a perfect medium.Things really went downhill for dessert though like straight off a cliff downhill. I ordered the red velvet cake and my mom had the raspberry chocolate cake. Mine was almost inedible. Considering the prestige of the restaurant I was surprised that the dessert was so unpalatable. It also tasted like they'd made it way in advance and just thawed it out for the day. My mom was equally unimpressed with her dessert.I thought service was a little dismissive but they were really busy on Mother's Day so I think that can be overlooked. After the meal all moms got a small bottle of sparkling red wine after the meal which was a nice touch!" u'**Restaurant Week Winter 2016 Dinner Review**My girlfriends and I chose to have dinner at Aureole - Liberty Room after scanning through the various menus and me finding out that the actual dining room had very solid reviews. \xa0We proceeded to have a lovely evening and loved the ambience decor and service Aureole provided us. \xa0Our water was always full and the waiter was always available. \xa0Excellent service all around!First course - spicy tuna tartare - this was delicious! \xa0I loved the extra little kick that the chili oil added to the tuna and the various textures that the garnishes and puffed rice gave to the dish. \xa0I would have liked this with some avocado as is sometimes the case with tuna tartare but this dish had excellent flavor and the fish was fairly fresh.Second course - short ribs - these short ribs made us all "mmm" audibly. \xa0It was so tender so flavorful juicy and just the right amount of fat (for me at least... others had more fat). \xa0The barley it came with was a bit bland but since the meat was so flavorful I was okay with that. \xa0Very nicely cooked piece of short rib... you didn\'t even need a knife. \xa0There was actually so much meat that none of us could finish it... one of those things where a little goes a long way and if you eat too much you could get sick of it.Third course - dessert! \xa0Dessert is always my favorite course and Aureole\'s did not disappoint. \xa0It didn\'t look like much but it was an the most amazing vanilla roasted pineapple ring with fresh mango sorbet that tasted like I was eating an actual mango. \xa0I would most definitely order this again and maybe try making it at home.Overall we found Aureole to be an excellent choice for Restaurant Week dinner. \xa0My 5 stars is solely for the restaurant week menu and price point - would come here again at the $38 price point.' u"Extremely disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had dinner Aureole last night and I experienced the absolute worst service of my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I work within the hospitality industry and i have my BT and MMH in hospitality management so I know a thing or two about the restaurant industry. \xa0I have been to other restaurants of this caliber before and each of the meals I had I will remember for the rest of my life for all the right reasons. The meal at I had at Aureole on the other handI will always remember for all the wrong reasons. The food it's self was ok at best. But the service was really where my experience soured. The section of the restaurant where we were seated in was the private dinning room which is completely segregated for the rest of the restaurant. We where placed there deliberately due to the fact that we decided to dine at Aureole for restaurant during week. After being seated we waited over an hour to order cocktails. To add insult to injury we where carded multiple times by the captain how first asked us if we where of age. He then proceeded to ask us for our ID's anyways. After ordering our drinks we waited an additional 45 minutes before our drinks arrived at the table. After the two hour mark the captain finally acknowledged our existence again and took out order. In addition to our meal my party decided to order a bottle of wine that is when we where carded again even though we already had drinks on the table and the captain saw our ID's. It took a additional 30 minutes for out fist course to arrive. It wasn't until the second course that our wine was brought to the table. The som was the only redeeming factor about the service. However the captain detracted for the wine service when I ordered the wine. I requested that the bottle be served with the first course but it was not fired until we where half way into the second course. To make matters even worse The captain also responded to my request and questions about the wine in a very condescending manner while blatantly ignoring my request. After our we finished our third course we waited an additional half an hour to have a plates cleared if that wasn't bad enough we where ignored for an additional 20 minutes before we receive the check. And at lest another additional 10 minutes to get our cards back. Although our meal should have lasted about 2 hours at most. But due the the inexcusable wait and lack of care by the captain our ordeal lasted over 3 and a half hours!!! If you as a restaurant are participating in restaurant week you should try to provided all of your guest with a truly memorable experience rather then banishing them to a corner of the restaurant and ignoring them just due to the fact they they went to your restaurant for the restaurant week tasting menu. If it is such a inconvenience for you to participate in restaurant week then simply do everyone a favor and do not ask to be added to that list. You will be saving a lot of people for a extremely disappointing and excessively long meal. In addition if this is how you treat all of your guests I don't think you will be on business for much longer. And I don't know who you bribed for your michelin star but I can tell you this Aureole you are definitely not worthy of such a prestigious reward. I would give this review negative stars however that is not a option but this was with out a doubt the worst service and most disappointing meal I have ever experienced!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" u"I thought this was fine but no more. I liked the Las Vegas incarnation better.I ate in the Liberty Room which is a la carte. My appetizer of pasta with ricotta veal ramp and wax beans was very good but the main course of poached halibut had an accompaniment that was too heavy on lemon and overpowered the delicate fish. Poached fish is also not the most attractive thing to set on a plate so the look of the dish as a little off too since it wasn't dressed up very attractively. The staff were very accommodating but the drinks and courses were pretty slow to come out. The room is also kind of loud with all the hard surfaces and the d\xe9cor is bland for my taste. Maybe they were going for contrast to the craziness of Times Square a block over but meh." u"Gluten-Free ReviewGluten-Free Patrons Look Elsewhere Let's get one thing straight the food here is 5 star and worthy of a King. However my review is solely based on the service accommodations and what I was told on the phone prior to booking for a gluten-free (allergy) patron such as myself.I wanted to take my family to a Michelin starred restaurant while on our trip to NYC and decided to look over the 30+ spots to hit up this one has been around a long time so I wanted to see what there game level was like. I called prior to making reservations and asked if they make accommodations to gluten-free people and she told me they had to ask the chef and call me back I never received a phone call back and finally called back 3 hours later. They told me yes they can make accommodations for gluten and I asked if it was leaving items off the entree or actually substitute certain items they told me they substitute certain features. As a YELP review before said they just left items off I was very adamant about this. The restaurant is beautiful on the inside and we were quickly seated once arrived we all 4 ordered the Tasting menu and had a few cocktails from the bar. It took about 5-7 minutes before any server acknowledged us at our table which we were kinda shocked about and told them of my allergy and they were aware. The service here was sub-par for this caliber of restaurant took time to get them to refill our water took about 10 minutes to make one cocktail drink every time I ordered one and was not as awesome as $18 should be. The reason for two stars: Entirely screwed me on the whole substitution thing with gluten-free instead of making gluten free waffles for the first course they left the waffle off informing me they do not have gluten-free bread (WTF?!). On every tasting menu item instead of placing something on there they just left the item off (even though I still paid full price for it). The final straw was they brought out the dessert with all wheat sprinkled over the dish and I was like are you serious this is suppose to be top of the top it took another 10 minutes for them to re make this dish and bring it back gluten-free after my family finished theirs. Thanks Aureole for ruining my $700 dinner night and making me regret my choice if you don't substitute for gluten-free people tell me and please work on your service with helping patrons with allergies. The food I did receive however was excellent." u'poached hake and slow roast lamb are great! very tender. CAVATELLI PASTA was delicious! Tuna tartare would be better if comes with more sauce. Dessert BLUEBERRY MILLE-FEUILLE and CHOCOLATE GENOISE are good!' u"Let me begin by saying: Get the tasting menu and let the everyone take care of you. All of the staff is extremely good at their jobs from the hostesses bartenders servers and based off the food obviously the entire kitchen staff. The tasting menu is obviously pretty up there in price but you definitely get your money's worth with the entire experience. Each course is presented to you by multiple servers and each ingredient is described from where it is sourced- to how it was used in the dish. If you opt to pay for the wine pairings the sommelier will present a different wine with each course. The tasting menu is a great way to sample a lot of things you wouldn't want to miss if you saw them on the menu at other restaurants: seared foie gras filet mignon tartare etc. Between the food beautiful dining areas and service (and hopefully the company you dine with) Aureole makes for a very memorable time." u"I would have given this place 5 stars but minus one since we were seated behind a pillar. The atmosphere here was wonderful and the food was amazing!! From the bread they gave out before the meal up until the end of the night everything was great! That bread really was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. The restaurant is right by Times Square and conveniently located away from the crowds. Overall it's an excellent choice especially if you're looking for something fancy." u"Came back again for RW Summer 2015 and RW Winter 2015/6. Unfortunately the menus weren't as great as RW Winter 2015. The execution was still good - but the concept of the dishes were not what we expected especially given how great RW Winter 2014 was! For RW Winter 2015/6 they opened up a new space behind the host stand that was a bit more intimate which was nice.PS. The scallion bread is still the Michael Jordan of all bread bowl breads.PPS. Aureole dessert is some seriously good shit." u"WHOoo! Came here for year end celebration with team. We definitely made the weight decision.Atmosphere:We have 7 people so we are reserved to dine in the main dinning room which is smaller than I though probably can only fit 40 people Maximum. And they only offer prix menu ($98 for three courses)  $125 for 5 courses or chef tasting menu for $148. If you want t order a la carte the you have to sit in lounge.Bread:Before I forgot my colleague want me to make sure give them credit for their excellent bread selections forgot the name of his favorite bread name but he said it was very good!Food:We decided to to the three courses because for the five courses you don't get to pick which dishes you like everything is settled already. For three courses menus you can pick one from appetizer one for main entree and then finished with a dessert. Seared Hudson valley foie gras: ( $10+ supplements)Foie gras was HUGE! I had been eating foie gras in so many restaurants and this one was definitely stand up among many of them consider of big portion ( fist size)  the texture still remain constant and tasted very smooth. I like the first bite of foie gras it was a blasted. However when it come to the end the taste kind of getting heavy and you know you have enough. Poached lobster:($10 supplements)I think lobster sauce helped this dished a lot lobster was very fresh I believed it was whole lobster. Lobster meat was well cooked not too dry the juicy and tenderness was right in the spot. Dessert:We order most of the dessert to share sorbet and gelato was very decent so many flavors. Strawberry(forgot the name\uff09\uff0c was very decent I think the presentation of dessert very impressed me and surprise me at some point. Because most of the restaurant dessert menu was very okay. In conclusion I think Aureole desired a Michelin starred restaurants. In terms of price 118( 20 dollar supplements) is little pricey for three course. If they didn't charge that extra bucks i will think this is good choice. Maybe 125 for five course is better deal for most of you." u"Beautiful setting tasteful decor and an overall great place to impress someone. A few fellow coworkers and I came by this place during Restaurant Week. I picked another place and my coworker picked this place: I got 3 votes and he got 4. I'm glad we ended up coming here. \xa0The bar area would be a great place for a date with its magnificent chandelier and flattering lighting but I digress... FOOD: -Tuna Tartare: This was generously portioned. The tuna was fresh and the presentation was gorgeous. 4/5. -Short Rib: This was really delicious. A cut (usually a tougher part of the cow) cooked so tender that I did not really need to cut into it. I substituted the barley that came with the preparation for brussel sprouts which was pretty good as well. 4.5/5. -Grilled Pineapple with sorbet: I must say I laughed at someone else's (negative review) stating that this restaurant comes from the cooking school of keep adding ingredients. A piece of pineapple a dot of sorbet and a tiny macaroon? Picking two out of the three and making it stronger would have been a better choice than what feels more like the kitchen sink (no pun intended). I would have personally liked more of the sorbet. 3/5. My coworker's peanut butter chocolate mousse looked more like a 4 or 5 star item though! SERVICE: Service was pretty good but could have been more attentive considering they weren't that swamped at 2PM. However the coat check was a nice touch. VERDICT: Beautiful space and pretty good food. Stick to the more traditional standbys (steak pasta seafood etc.) and beware of anything that sounds too try-hard to be trendy (e.g. pineapple with a hint of sorbet and a sprig of macaroon and a dusting of graham cracker AND ...). I'll come back to try their non-Restaurant Week offerings." u"Came here for dinner during restaurant week with a bunch of girlfriends.. and it did not disappoint! Presentation/quality of food and ambience is how I can see they got their Michelin Star. \xa0First course (pasta) - We couldn't get enough of this dish. \xa0Cooked perfectly al dente creamy tomato flavor and a hint of pesto - this was a standout Second course (braised short rib) - Excellent flavor and consistency however a bit dry for my liking. \xa0Creamy risotto was a great complement and made up for the dryness of the short rib. Third course (chocolate dessert) - wonderful presentation and perfect end to the meal. Would absolutely return here again!" u"This strikingly beautiful restaurant located in the heart of Manhattan is on a mission to create a truly memorable dining experience. Chef Marcus Gleadow-Ware brings his passion and love to his delightful dishes. With his culinary skills I could easily end up going to Aureole another time. Or five.From the moment we entered this romantic restaurant we felt like we were whisked away. The level of attention we had was beyond rare and genuine and that what puts Aureole in the highest echelon.Everything was handsome from the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare to the New York Strip Steak. And you don't want to miss the seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras.More to enjoy as you choose the wine pairing your refined palate will be singing.Back to Five Yelps." u"Aureole was definitely one of my favorite lunch experiences for restaurant week. The restaurant is gorgeous elegant and a modern design with warm lighting and beautiful glass wine display. Staff was friendly attentive and professional adding to the pleasant dining experience. Although from one course to the next I felt food did take a while to arrive but we weren't rushed and the timing was just right to enjoy relax and prepare yourself for the next plate of flavors. From the restaurant week menu:Appetizer:Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare (Jicama Bonito Cream Cucumber) - the bonito cream was too citrusy in flavor didn't really enhance the tuna itself. I liked the texture and freshness of the jicama and cucumber. Entree:Braised Short Rib (Pearl Barley Horseradish Watercress) - subtle and delicious sauce over the perfectly cooked and flavorful short rib. I had an excellent cut but my boyfriend's was 50% chunk of fat :( Nevertheless the flavor was so delicious and seeped well into the nice and fluffy barely. This dish is heavy for lunch and the portion size was so huge we took leftovers back home to gladly eat later.Dessert (got to taste both):Vanilla Roasted Pineapple (Coconut Macaron Mango Lime Sorbet) - after the braised short rib this one really hit the spot! Unfortunately this was my boyfriend's pick so I couldn't devour the whole thing myself. The mango lime sorbet was heavy on the mango which I really liked. The pineapple was light on the vanilla but so deliciously roasted to be warm and sweet. Peanut Butter Crunch (Chocolate Mousse Cream Gelato) - figured you couldn't go wrong with peanut butter anything but this one wasn't as satisfying after the short rib because the peanut butter thick and heavy in texture and flavor. I loved how well the crunch worked with the dark creamy and soft chocolate mousse though. Everything was beautifully plated and the flavors were all creative and different from what I've had. I loved the ambiance and enjoyed my dining experience here. Aureole definitely gives a good name to modern American fine dining." u"Service is always great here!The food on the other hand is good and very tasty...don't get me wrong it's good...but for a 1 Michelin-star restaurant I'm expecting something to wow me. I've been here twice but nothing has wow'ed me; or it could also mean I'm hard to impress??? Nooooooo I'm EASY totally EASY when it comes to food! Anything you order here will be good but for me it just doesn't strike that one Michelin-star note. Desert is another story....this must be were the Michelin-star comes into play! The deserts are creative and AMAZING!!!!! Could it be I have a sweet tooth?Location service and ambiance are awesome! The waiters are always on point and one thing I REALLY REALLY like is the attention they pay to you if you have a theater show to go to (this is why I give them the 4 stars instead of 3) in the evening! They make sure you are feed well in time for your show. Well done!"]
60.Orso,[u'If you have ever been to Italy you know what authentic pasta is supposed to be like. Well I have been to many "fancy" Italian places in the city including Scalinatella and Del Posto...so far no one has had authentic pasta except this place and Bruno Pizza.The service here was a little spotty my dad got a little pissed at the waiter which takes a lot. \xa0But the food was good.Good place for pre-theater. Make sure you make a reservation far in advance otherwise even though they have tables they will tell you they don\'t have one unless you\'re some important famous or rich person.' u'A solid choice for sure with prices that are not over the top but the kitchen was not as great as I had hoped. Pizza\'s were very thin crust pretty nice especially the funghi which was interesting and delicious. The scallops I had just wasn\'t the best mix of flavors it came out rather "cold" even though the searing on the scallops was very good and the portion was excellent and well presented. This is a solid choice. Especially since you can get large 1 litre carafe\'s of wine either primitivo or pinot grigio for $30. That\'s pretty good in a city that can cost you a lot more for alcohol on the table. The service and ambience are also good. Again not great or memorable but very nice for a date or a business group meal.' u'For those searching for a reliable theater district meal -- keep looking. \xa0Orso is an average restaurant boasting higher prices than the food or service supports. \xa0Mediocre food pairs appropriately with an uninspiring drink / wine list. The appetizers are swiming in cheese to mask the true flavors of the dishes the portions of which are probably 20% too small to justify their prices. \xa0Main dishes are likewise disappointing. The Black Spaghetti should be a home run but instead is coated in pungent film. The pasta crab and hot oil should blend together. \xa0Instead they seem to be fighting each other. \xa0The smell is unappetizing and evokes images of picnicking beside the Gowanus Canal. \xa0The skirt steak is wet with some type of coating that renders the steak useless and unrecognizable. Saving the restaurant from one star is the service which is professional and pleasant.' u"The ambiance of the place is nice the inside is charming and the dishes are pretty. I came here because I saw the reviews on yelp were up there. Around 5:15 the place was packed but I was the youngest person in there. The crowd is on the older side (maybe because I was there for an early dinner). The Caprese appetizer was my favorite part - the mozzarella cheese was extremely fresh. I got the fra diavolo pizza and it was just okay. I was expecting the sauce to have more spice it sort of tasted like regular pizza sauce. I liked the thin crust and it wasn't greasy at all. The wait staff was very nice and accommodating.If I were to go back I'd try the pasta. Overall there was nothing bad about my experience but there was nothing to make me want to run back here so quickly." u"Orso was recommended by a local friend but when we asked the concierge at our hotel he recommended against it. We should have listened to the concierge!My dining companion and I both ordered pasta dishes. We ordered half portions because normally that means the full portions are really large right? Who knows but our half portions were tiny. We were not offered parmesan so I had to flag down the waitress to get some. In the end my pasta was mediocre and I didn't even finish. Disappointing. Meanwhile the waitress was unpleasant and seemed exasperated even though we had minimal contact with her. Will not go back." u"For my experience last Sunday I always believed the Yelp and I just founded this restaurant. Food was not super surprised but it was ok... Big thing was I swiped my credit card and I paid tip for cash but the next day my credit card statement had extra charged $17.40 (tip) from Orso!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Extremely super super disappointed and I called the bank and they got fund back to me!!!!! In my opinion don't go there but if you want to go there please be careful!!!" u"After being raved about and recommended to come I was just a little underwhelmed. There are so many amazing options in the theater district and I know Orso is one of the top go-to spots for many and I'm glad I finally made my way. I came here on a quiet Tuesday night at 7pm just missing the theater goers was probably a wise move.We started with a bottle of the Pinot Nero which was very very light. Wouldn't have been my #1 choice but I went with the table. I had the Fra Diavlo pizza which was good but I wasn't a big fan of the crust. It was thin crust but not your typical brick oven pizza. We also had the orecchiette which was great flavorful with sweet italian sausage and broccoli rabe. The service was good nothing outstanding but our table was able to sit relax and enjoy without being rushed or pressured. It was an enjoyable meal and I would come back but would order differently. I think I'd skip the pizza and go for an appetizer instead!" u'I would recommend. \xa0 I had the pear salad as an appetizer and the homemade rigatoni Bolognese for my entree. \xa0 Both were excellent.' u"Went there for dinner this evening with my wife and son. \xa0Restaurant d\xe9cor and ambiance were nice though it was pretty noisy. \xa0 The service was prompt and friendly (and water glasses were kept full). \xa0However things weren't so great on the food side. \xa0Nothing terrible; just ok. \xa0A basket of crusty bread was provided along with some white bean-based spread. \xa0The bread was good but the spread was just ok; I would have been happier with simple olive oil. \xa0No bread plates were provided (not forgotten they just don't use them) so crusty bread crumbs end up all over the table cloth. \xa0Would've preferred the plate thank you. \xa0For dinner I had the stuffed quail. \xa0Having read some great reviews I was looking forward to it. \xa0It was nicely prepared and presented but it was absolutely bland. just nothing there. \xa0Might as well have had a chicken breast. My son had the margherita pizza - he described it as largely flavorless. \xa0(My wife tried it and agreed.) \xa0Worth mentioning that last night my son ordered a pizza from room service here at our hotel the Times Square Doubletree. \xa0He thought the hotel's pizza was better. \xa0(I didn't try either so can't really comment.) \xa0It is worth noting that he is 14 - so consider his review in the appropriate light. \xa0My wife had the halibut. \xa0She thought it was good.Too many great restaurants in town to risk giving it another shot especially when quite a few reviews echo my experience." u"This is a perfect restaurant for a pre-theatre dinner. The food is delicious the portions are ideal (filling but not overbearing) and the atmosphere is lovely. The restaurant is small but it is quaint peaceful and has the most beautiful plates and cups. Seriously though I plan on buying the same brand for my own kitchen!As for the actual meal itself the food is really fantastic. They start you off with some bread and white bean dip which is incredibly addicting. I challenge you not to get seconds... and thirds. For my main dish I order the large maltagliata pasta dish. The pasta was well-cooked and the mushrooms really tasty and not overbearing at all. I hate when pasta dishes are too heavy and I feel immobile afterwards; that's not the case here. It's a nice light pasta dish you will surely enjoy. Beyond the pasta I also shared the margherita pizze and that was also delicious shockingly good even. It may have been the best pizza I've had when dining in at an Italian restaurant. The ingredients were very fresh the crust was light and crisp and it had a lovely balance between the cheese and sauce. Definitely a nice option for sharing with the table!On top of that the service is great and the coffee is awesome. You can't go wrong with dinner at orso." u'Good quality food excellent service. Fast turnaround suitable for theatre goers' u"We had an excellent pre-show meal here. \xa0We started with the Carciofini (pan fried baby artichokes garlic pecorino Romano lemon) really enjoyed the Pollo (pan roasted free-range chicken roasted cauliflower) and Cavoletti (fried Brussels sprouts lemon) and finished with an amazing chocolate Budino. \xa0I would probably skip the Pizze (go to John's instead) and Gelato. \xa0Next time I'll probably try the Rigatoni. \xa0Great service too!" u"Good food close quarters atmosphere and top notch service. \xa0I came here with my fiance for Valentine's Day dinner and they had both a regular menu and a Valentine's day pre fixe menu. \xa0The only reason why they don't get a five star rating is because the best dishes I had were only on the pre fixe even though in the past I know they had it on their regular menu. \xa0I would've liked the choice to have picked a combination of these dishes. \xa0To start my fiance and I ordered the Carpaccio made with beef brown butter sage parmesan and grilled asparagus. \xa0It was delicious and the beef was so soft and smooth it literally melted in your mouth. \xa0We also ordered the Funghi mushroom with shredded cheese and diced cabbage. The dish was lite but not very flavorful save the drizzles of vinegar over the plate. \xa0I guess the flavors of the mushroom were never really meant to be strong or intense.For the main we ordered the Parpadelle and the Agnello lamb chops. \xa0These two dishes were delicious all the way from the way the lamb chops were cooked to the sauce in the Parpadelle. \xa0The grilled lamb chops were cooked medium rare and garnished with hazelnut pesto with roasted artichokes on the side. \xa0The pesto gave a great oily garlic coating to the lamb. \xa0 The Parpadelle was cooked with a parmesan oyster mushroom sauce which was paired extremely well with the texture of perfectly cooked pasta. \xa0I would like to have both of these dishes again but knowing it was once on their menu but now no longer stands as a regular menu item I feel a bit let down and makes me mark Orso a star lower than I would've. \xa0Hopefully if by chance I come upon this restaurant again and see either one of these on their menu I will return for another delightful night of dining with my fiance." u'Fine Italian food at a theater-row classic. Orso was new and inventive once. Now it is still great. The food is delicious classic Italian fair (for visitors-- very much not Italian-American like several others on the block). The service is friendly and fairly casual. The restaurant can be busy and though handsome and softly lighted can be noisy. If you want to eat at peak theatre time probably book over a week ahead.' u"I was our 8th Wedding Anniversary and we saw Kinky Boots for the first time. \xa0In fact it was our first NYC theater experience. \xa0I searched for a place that would be open after our show walkable and not far from our hotel...stayed at the Marriott Marque and Orso fit the bill. \xa0I made the reservation here on Yelp.com through OpenTable. \xa0Which is great because you don't have to go to another site. \xa0In the special comment section I told the staff we were celebrating our Anniversary. \xa0when we arrived the Outside looked impressive with its front entrance that is done with steps down and beautiful hand railings. \xa0As with most NYC establishments space is limited but Orso does a good job with the flow. \xa0No bar stools at the bar so it doesn't get crowed with too many people. \xa0Although we were there at 10:45pm so it may be a different story at 8:30pm. \xa0The Manager had our reservation and asked how to say our name which is nice. \xa0They sat us promptly but asked if we would like to wait a few minutes there was a cozier table opening up. \xa0We decided to stay at the table they sat us at and watch all the lovely people coming in and out. \xa0Service was great! \xa0They acknowledged our anniversary...Which meant they read the notes! \xa0They brought us a complementary basket of pizza bread to the table. \xa0It was very thin and crispy with rosemary and garlic. \xa0Very good start to the meal. \xa0Its an Italian Restaurant and so are the wines. \xa0I am more familiar with California Wines than anything else but the staff made sure we could pick a favorite from their selection. \xa0Just tell them what you like! \xa0I love Red Wine Vinegar Dressing and their house salad was simple and yummy. \xa0The greens was very chilled which says its not sitting out in a bowl somewhere in the back of the house. \xa0They also brought us some crusty Italian bread and olive oil but on request brought some lovely unsalted butter (which is its own food group in my opinion!). \xa0Dinner for us was simple a Rigatoni and an Orecchiette with Sweet Italian Sausage Ragu. \xa0Orso is making all their own pastas and the menu is updated daily. \xa0Dinner was followed by their lovely flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce. \xa0The kitchen may have lost our dinner ticket because our meals were a little slow in arriving. \xa0However I am still giving 5 stars because they over came it and acknowledged it and made our night even better. \xa0Do try the flourless chocolate cake...it is heaven if you love really dense dark chocolate that leaves you with that bold chocolate sense and none of the crazy sweet after taste. \xa0By all means if you live or are visiting NYC and are in the Theater District put Orso in you bucket list you wont be disappointed." u'I recently ate here with several friends for the 1st time. I live in the neighborhood and was looking to try a new Italian restaurant. While the staff and restaurant were pleasant the food while fresh was not real yummy. \xa0It was also not plentiful. There are 2 portions of pasta and we each ordered the larger portion but quite frankly it looked like the smaller portion when it arrived. \xa0There are many Italian restaurants in the area that have tastier and larger portions as well as being less expensive. I probably will not return' u'Had the pleasure of eating there during restaurant week. The appetizer of mussels was a very generous portion. The sauce was incredibly tasty (I wanted to drink it) and the toasted dipping bread was amazing. My entree was the hanger steak beautifully sliced and cooked perfectly medium rare over polenta with broccoli rabe. I would order the same exact dish again. The bread for the table was deliciously crusty and warm.' u'One of the last real places that Patrick Bateman used to go to. We had a nice bottle of wine and a bunch of apps before we went to our show. The spread for the bread was also really good.CALAMARIgrilled Montauk squid arugula cherry tomato chickpeas onion salmoriglio sauceCARCIOFINIpan-fried baby artichokes hot peper garlic Romano cheese' u"Came here before our Play on a Thursday night and All I can say is WOW! \xa0 The food was FABULOUS and service was good. \xa0There are 2 medium size dining rooms with the bathrooms down the flight of stairs (small bit clean). \xa0When I arrived they wanted to sit us at a table next to the kitchen but I refused to sit at that table for 2 because I did not want to hear the clanging of the dishes and watch the staff run in/out of the kitchen as I ate so we took another table that was not right up to the kitchen. \xa0I ordered the Pasta dish called Casarecce that is grilled eggplant tomato basil ricotta salta. \xa0This pasta is made fresh on the premises daily according \xa0to our waiter and let me say this dish was delicious!My friend ordered the Grilled Skirt Steak gorgonzola soft polenta broccoli rabe salsa oreganta and she thought this dish was delicious - the meat was like butter she said when you cut through each piece. \xa0We didn't feel rushed out because they wanted to turn over the tables. \xa0This is a Must Go To if you are ever going the the theater." u"If you love Calfs liver you would love theirs it's lightly floured with crispy onions and some bacon delicious! \xa0Wish they served whole wheat or multi-grain bread. \xa0Complimentary bean dip. \xa0Didn't care for pear and beet salad."]
122.Piccolo Cafe,[u"Great place for a quick to-go lunch! The Quinoa salad is AWESOME- It's worth the $14- and you get a free add on (I usually get brussel sprouts). The chicken sandwich is really good and so is the soup (usually no dairy). They have a good deal that if you buy 5 meals you get one free! The prices are normal and they have a good deal of half sandwich and soup for $9.I come here most days for lunch and 9 times out of 10 I am glad that I did! The girls at the cash are very nice and attentive." u"Really mediocre. Came in the afternoon and just would like to grab some iced coffee with little ice; yet once I informed the barista about my customized little ice option she kept repeating herself on how the ice was not icy and it should be ok or something like that; so I would have to tell her in the end that I just prefer some coffee with no ice - she seemed not too happy about this and unwillingly poured some ice out. Onto the coffee itself it was really bland with no taste whatsoever - probably that was the reason the barista did not want to pour ice into it...Worst experience meh coffee I don't see a point coming back." u"The first stop after landing in NYC? \xa0Lunch! \xa0We wandered around Times Square looking for a quick hop in/hop out kind of place and stumbled upon Piccolo. \xa0A quick check on Yelp and we were pleased with the many good reviews so we decided to go ahead and stop in.Very small deli. \xa0No floor tables just a bar and stool set up along the perimeter. \xa0We asked the cashier which sandwiches were the most popular and she politely gave us her recommendations. \xa0We went with a couple of her suggestions and were very very pleased.I had the Turkey Signature Sandwich which had mesculun greens aioli tomatoes and herbs. \xa0It was absolutely delicious! \xa0Served with a salad of greens and balsamic which tasted so good. \xa0Very filling and perfect for lunch.Hubby had the Chicken Schnitzel. \xa0He is not the easiest to please but he loved his sandwich. \xa0Delicately breaded with arugula tomatoes and mayo. \xa0I took a bite and enjoyed it as well.We split a bag of chips and two canned sodas completed our meal. \xa0If we weren't already planning on a huge dinner we might've went the pasta route here because they have a nice selection of items - ravioli fettucine lasagna etc. \xa0Also I realized too late they served lattes and other coffees which I would have loved to try.Very happy with our lunch choice. \xa0The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming and kind of puts you off slightly because it's small and definitely no-frills but give it a chance. \xa0It was good eats!" u'Piccolo Cafe has one of my favorite salads ever: the Kabocha Squash Beet Root and Goat Cheese Salad! It\'s served in a typical to-go salad bowl (32 oz I think) with steamed kabocha squash red beets and super creamy goat cheese over a bed of spinach. It\'s also only $10 but I usually like to add eggplants for an additional $2. The eggplants are slightly on the mushier side but I really like them that way. It\'s seasoned nicely with great flavors. I only wish they would give more of the "good stuff" (e.g. kabocha squash and goat cheese) because the last time I ordered it the salad had 80% spinach and 20% other stuff. I have also gotten pasta from Piccolo cafe and I love their gnocchi lasagna and lobster spaghetti. Can\'t go wrong with any of these!' u"Limited seating but sandwiches are reasonably priced. They seem to use more quality components than try to stuff a bunch of garbage onto tasteless bread. I'd go back to try additional subs. I tried the Salume sub (#1) but they have a lot of options that looked good." u'Location: Piccolo never comes to my mind that this is a true hidden gem in a crowded place. Piccolo is located right at Port Authority area and right by the subway station. I have been here always but never felt the need to come in. Part of the reason is because this place is too small and the decoration is like ages.I am grateful that I did come in eventually. The service is niceThe coffee is strong.Love to try their sandwiches in the future.' u"Came here for lunch on a Monday and was surprised that it was relatively empty. I ordered the fettuccine bolognese ($12) which came with a small garlic roll and a salad in a cup. Italian cuisine is one of my favorites so naturally my standards were high. Piccolo wasn't anything special but then again nothing in a 10 block radius of Times Square is. So use your discretion before swinging by - if you need fuel this will do it. If you need flavor head elsewhere." u"I came here randomly one morning and ordered a latte and a truffle egg sandwich. The latte was good but small and the truffle egg sandwich was a little pricey at $10 but came with a free small coffee. The sandwich was on point--it had a good amount of lettuce to sauce ratio and had an overwhelming amount of egg. I liked that they weren't skimping out on the perfectly fluffy egg. Even the bread was good albeit a bit chewy so it was hard to bite into without its innards falling out. Cute small place with friendly staff." u'Had coffee and breakfast everyday here while staying in NY. Staff was nice coffee was great and food was very reasonably priced. Being so close to Times Square this was a great step away from the madness. Would only stay this close to Times Square again because of this place.' u"Very tiny take-out in midtown that never disappoints! My office used to be about 10 feet from here; I'm a block away now and still make the trek regularly. The menu is pretty large but generally similar ingredients. My go-to is any sandwich with fresh mozzarella and/or prosciutto which comes with a little salad; on snow days I up the comfort factor and splurge on gnocchi. It's a lot faster when you aren't in line during peak hours but I'm okay with a 5-10 min wait knowing they're making things fresh." u'A stones throw from Port Authority station. Very inconspicuous. I nearly walked right past it. Had the eggplant prosciutto di Parma panini. Excellent. Had a good espresso too. $13 total. Small with very little room to sit but would definitely recommend. Try to avoid lunch rush.' u"Delightful little treasure in the horror that is Times Square cuisine. \xa0I've had the pasta panini and now salads here. \xa0Everything is delicious fresh and made with high quality ingriedients. \xa0It is a little pricey - but you pay for what you get no?" u'Breakfast sandwiches and salads are the only organic offerings. Quite tasty. \xa0A cute quick oicker-up place and barvstools if you have 5 minutes to stay and dine. Great staff.' u"Piccolo Caf\xe9 manages to take something as mundane as a breakfast sandwich and make it into an exquisite dish.I had never heard of or noticed Piccolo Caf\xe9 until I came across the Yelp listing. Instead of getting one of their lunch sandwiches I opted to check out their breakfast offerings. They have a lot of great options but I had to get the truffle egg sandwich. It was $9 but it was a delicious flavorful sandwich (egg greens truffle pate tomato-all on a hearty Italian flatbread) that came with a medium-sized coffee.The employee working there was also very friendly. Can't wait to come back." u'Hidden gem for sure. Stopped here for breakfast before a meeting nearby. This tiny little place has window seating delicious egg sandwiches of croissants and decent coffee. What more could you want?' u'P retty cute lil place good for a simple lunch :]I t seems like mostly foot traffic during rushC an only seat a handful of people on stoolsC appuccino was decent but nothing specialO rdered sandwiches: a bit dry but fairly tastyL ines move fast but the food takes a whileO rdinary service naught to criticize or praise' u"Not a fan... the tomato basil olives and mozz pannini was flavorless I asked for arugula and there wasn't any (that would have at least added some oomph). It also wasn't pressed and my tomatoes were just cold and slapped on. They also don't have whole grain bread as an option. The black bean soup was good but its really just black beans & some seasoning so don't expect some new pow- which one wouldn't in ordering a simple soup for lunch but still. \xa0I've had a good experience previously. But still everything I had lacked salt. It's just ehh. Not that bad for $7 for 1/2 a pannini (well not really that) and a small soup cup." u'One of the best breakfast sandwiches in midtown. Their truffle egg Sanwich is to die for.' u"Nice and quaint little coffee shop near Times Square.It's tucked by the new NYT building and if you don't look closely enough you might just miss it. \xa0The space is small with only a few stools for people to sit but it seems like most people who come here just order and go.I had a cappuccino here and it was good. \xa0The folks are extremely friendly and they were really cool in terms of service. \xa0It was easy to see why this place is popular and the lines can get long. \xa0Either way if you're nearby and want a decent cup of coffee I strongly recommend this place!" u"Wonderful friendly quick service froma Ashley and Jennifer and amazing breakfast salame egg sandwich without the spicy jalapeno jelly that comes with a coffee. \xa0Wonderful pasta dishes such as lasagna bolognese fettucine bolognese gnocci bolognese and grilled salmon salad and beets squash at goat cheese salad and to die for desserts such as the berry crumble. After 5PM until 6:30PM there is a meal deal of 2 for $16 for some items and there is a great frequent buyer stamp card with a free meal/item after every 5 stamps. \xa0Can't wait to return."]
102.Victor’s Cafe,[u"This food. This environment. The service! I have walked by Victor's Cafe since 2009 when I was on Broadway just a few doors down. Why didn't I go in?!?! Walked in for dinner the other day finally. the decor was very classy upon entrance. The table was in the back room where there's a sky roof full of natural light and lots of Cuban/Miami pastels--very nice touch! We ordered 3 small plates and an avocado with bacon/guacamole goodness inside. It was worth all of our time! Every dish was FULL of flavor. The service was super attentive and polite. There was also FABULOUS live music happening in the bar area and yes I salsa'd my way out the front door. Prices point matches that of midtown QUALITY food and ambiance. GO!" u"Victor's Cafe is living on it's name alone! Decided to have dinner here on a whim after watching Jersey Boys. We were hungry and when I noticed that this well known spot was just across the street we had to check it out! The restaurant is beautiful --- very tastefully decorated modern but with a feel reminiscent of old Havana. We were seated in the back room with lots of plants and fans on the ceiling and promptly presented with menus. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and quickly decided on an appetizer and the entrees we wanted.I understand that portions can be small at certain restaurants but our Cuban Quesadilla was ridiculous. It was the equivalent of 4 bites shared between two people. It was delicious! But again ridiculous given the price tag. My husband ordered the Camarones Enchilados and it was fantastic! However when he ordered the waiter asked him what accompaniment he wanted with his meal and offered tostones roasted vegetables or an avocado salad of which he chose the latter. When our bill arrived we noticed that the salad was not included with the meal at all and was in fact $14 for a plate of watercress and a quarter of an avocado! We didn't fight it it would have been in poor taste and I suppose we should have inquired whether or not it was included when ordering but it was very misleading. I ordered the short ribs which were the most substantial portion but also the weakest dish of everything we tried. It was seasoned with some sort of very odd herb that gave it a weird and unpleasant aftertaste.Service was somewhat scattered and can be called average at best. Victor's Cafe seems to lack the authenticity that I had always heard it was so famous for. Cauliflower puree? Organic field greens? Champagne vinaigrette? Give me a break! The restaurant is beautiful. And that's about all. Rincon Criollo in Corona Queens may not look as posh but their food and service beats Victor's Cafe by a mile! Stop by for a drink and enjoy the ambiance then head elsewhere for dinner." u"YUM! The snapper ceviche was to die for the empanadas were amazing and the Ponle ropa a la vaca was a flavor bomb. \xa0I could eat the churros forever. The service was amazing everyone was polite and nice and we're happy to give us suggestions! A little pricy but totally worth it!" u"My husband and I had only had one prior Cuban meal in the city. But if all Cuban foods were as good as ones served at victor's cafe then we need to eat it more frequently! We invited 4 of our friends to a triple dinner date on Friday night. First thing that struck us - We really loved the ambiance of the restaurant - the decor the music - everything just seemed so perfect. The service was a bit on the slower side which surprised me since Victor's Cafe is such a popular dining go-to for nearby theatres. Although our foods did take some time to be served we were given complimentary plantain chips to hold us over. They were still warm when served - I couldn't help but demolish (almost) the entire basket myself. My husband and I stuck to their signature entrees - ropa vieja and camaneros enchilados - while our friends also ordered the ceviche and empanadas to start. The portions might appear small at first glance (my eyes are always bigger than my stomach) but they were surprisingly filling. My husband couldn't stop raving about his dish. And I found my shrimp in creole sauce over mashed sweet potato? with rice and beans extremely tasty! The shrimp were a bit overcooked but the sauce was lick my bowl worthy. The rice were fluffy and the beans were perfectly seasoned - we didn't bother ordering any additional sides since these two basic pairings were already so satisfying! I purposely didn't get a starter because I wanted to save enough stomach room for desserts! Each couple shared a tres leches came and guava cobbler The majority of the group preferred the tres leches. I thought it was good but I had better (hello Calle Dao!) - it was a little too dense and not sweet enough for me. I enjoyed the warm gooey crumbly guava cobbler served with vanilla ice cream much more. Overall - service was attentive foods were tasty ambiance was perfect - Definitely check out Victor's Cafe especially when in theater district!" u'Several of my friends and I have been coming here for many many years. We always brought other people visitors/guests from out of town etc. because the food and service were always on point. As reflected in my previous reviews. So we brought back a group of 10 here after a show about a month or so ago. Unfortunately.......the experience was quite disappointing. The place was busy on a Saturday night which is pretty typical for most well know/good places in NYC. But the standard of food & service was simply not the same as we have experienced in the past years. Took the waiter forever to get our drinks out. We asked for more of the plantain chips and were told that the kitchen was out of them & preparing more....a Cuban spot running out of plantain chips on a Sat night really? (Poor planning). But then we see them being brought to other tables around us & our waiter completely forgot to get us more. When you are pay $100/head or more....an extra round of chips should not be too much to ask. Many of the entrees that came out were barely lukewarm at best.....2 people had the fish entree special & it was way too salty. The classic Ropa Vieja had been changed & was no longer served in the classic plantain chips basket. Dessert was just OK.Overall not the best night.... :(' u"I have a soft spot for Victor's cafe because we go out for a family dinner here every year and it is always a good time.I like the well seasoned cuban food.It is a little expensive but I wouldn't say the food isn't worth the money and the interior of the restaurant is pretty cool." u'This is one of my favorite Midtown restaurants. \xa0I have been there many times over the past two decades and I have never had a bad experience. \xa0The food and service are always great. \xa0Friendly helpful servers and diligent room management make a busy spot run smoothly.I have had many items from the menus but always remember the Salpic\xf3n de Mariscos appetizer and Ropa Vieja entree.If I could eat here weekly I would!' u"So far not so good. 5:45 pre-theatre reservation. Either they don't want to seat me prior to entire party arriving or the table not ready till 6:00. Either way it's not a good start. But this is Times Square and they do have to deal with tourists. Hoping the food is worth it because the front desk staff isn't" u"Well hadn't been here for several years and although the place remains impeccably perfect in decor and ambiance and culture is on FLEEK the artwork on display is still very true to Cuban art. \xa0Everything from the live music in the Cuba Lounge (bar) when you walk in to the lighting  staff plants and the soul of this place is authentic. \xa0We had the sampler appetizer with the croquetas (real ham croquetas) corn based Tamal empanadas and seafood fritters were amazing. \xa0We also had the vaca frita (crispy fried beef strips) which come scooped perfectly in a green plantain flower bud. \xa0And we also ordered the Ponle Ropa A La Vaca which had vaca frita and a ropa vieja which is a similar meat (not crispy)but stewed and in a tomatoe based sauce." u'I came here for a late dinner with a colleague/friend on a Saturday night. It\'s pretty much just blocks away from the touristy Times Square area so you will get that vibe when you\'re just outside the restaurant. Once you get inside though it\'s a whole other story. The ambiance completely changes into a classy but casual atmosphere. I love the decor of the restaurant and the way the tables are arranged (there\'s plenty of seating but it\'s not tight). Also there is an area in the back that sort of looks like a lounge. In this area there is a VIP looking table with a semi-circular booth. It made me want to dress up in a fancy dress and fur sit at that table and order expensive champagne-like a boss. *insert daydreamingBack to reality: my friend and I decided on the "1492 Aperitivo Cubano" which is an appetizer for two with a variety of foods; basically a sample platter. I was looking forward to trying different things. Honestly it was just okay. It tasted fresh though. My drink (the mojito with the sugar cane stick) was delightful and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Our waiter was nice but seemed slightly forgetful. For example after I ordered my drink I saw him standing idle near the kitchen. Still when we were waiting for a while he did look in our direction and get what we had requested without having to be asked a second time.Overall positive experience. Want to go back for entrees next time.SN: take that silly hand drying contraption out of the bathroom-yes the one where you have to stick your hands in and let them dry. The grey and yellow one that looks all futuristic. The one where you have to stand complete still when drying your hands so you won\'t accidentally hit your hand against the dryer and have to wash and dry them again. That is all thanks.' u'Food taste very fresh portions were just right.I had the shrimp it was delicious my bf had pork he said it was very flavorful a tad greasy but okay.Mine came with rice and black beans i add sweet plantains.' u"Came here for dinner with a large party and was quite pleased with everything: the food the service and the overall ambiance.My mind is blanking on the full array of starters and shared plates but I'll try giving a run down of the things I know we had!Ceviche de Pargo ($16): 5/5- This. Was. AMAZING! I loved every moment of this ceviche and honestly wish I'd ordered my own instead of sharing with the table. It was that good.Aguacate Relleno ($12)- I didn't try this myself as I don't eat bacon but this was a huge hit amongst the rest of my party and I won't lie -- I was a little envious because it looked delicious.Other shared plates I can't seem to find on the menu included fried plaintains and a crab appetizer both of which were also delicious. Now onto the main courses!Camarones Enchilados ($27): 4/5- I really enjoyed this dish. The shrimp was done perfectly and I loved the sauce! I wish there was a little more kick to it though.Paella de Langosta y Mariscos ($44): 5/5- This seems like an expensive dish (and it is) but honestly it is HUGE! Two people could easily share this. Lucky for me I sat next to someone who ordered it and got to try quite a bit! Amazing.We also had plenty of sangria which was also delicious. Bathrooms are located downstairs. Overall a solid Cuban restaurant in Midtown." u"If I could give this place zero stars I would readily do so. \xa0After reading the numerous reviews on how amazing this restaurant is I went ahead and made reservations a month before my trip to New York. \xa0Upon arriving at the restaurant they seated us in the bar lounge not in the main restaurant dining room in what was literally a hallway. \xa0When I asked if there were any other tables they said I would have to wait 45 more minutes for a table in the actual dining room. \xa0Considering that this is a higher end restaurant I was appalled that after making these reservations a month ago this was the best seat they could give us. \xa0We left the restaurant frustrated and unhappy with the service that we received from the two hosts. \xa0I'm sure the food is amazing but the service is much to be desired." u"Not many places are able to blow my mind. \xa0Victors Cafe did exactly that. Especially when your someone like myself who's eaten at a lot of restaurants or even if you frequent the same ones over and over again. \xa0Now even though I've meet the owners through a old friend who use to work here my review isn't biased.Pros:From the time that I walked in until the time that I walked out customer service was A+Food is A+ I enjoyed the ox tail empanadas red snapper and ceviche de camarones so much I wish their was more when I was finished. It left a lasting imprint. Live music played by different musicians which makes VC's feel so much more Cuban! Like let's face it its hard to create an authentic Cuban environment in the middle of the concrete jungle. That doesn't stop VC's from providing you with that authenticity that screens out; tasty Cuban food Cuban music that'll have you begging to return.p.s last time I visited was summer 2015 and plan on returning this summer~" u"Great atmosphere. Great food. Great service. If you're in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the money." u'The and I mean the only place for a mojito I like mine with passion fruit. Highly recommend the Lechon Asado or Ropa Vieja cuban staples. Be sure to go on a Friday or Saturday night for the live performances (at the Cuba Lounge). My group was serenaded and became the subject matter of the impromptu songs it was an absolute trip!!' u'An amazing experience so great we went two nights in a row! \xa0The first night we were in a rush due to a show. \xa0The waiter was extremely accommodating and made food recommendations that would come out quicker. \xa0Combine the wonderful service with nice ambiance music playing and some great food what more could you ask for! \xa0Since we enjoyed the food so much we decided to come back the next night and give us more time to enjoy the food. \xa0Again great service and food. \xa0This is a must go \xa0if you have a show to attend. \xa0Try to go a little early so you can enjoy multiple dishes and just a great experience!' u"This is by far my favorite Cuban restaurant in NY. Excellent service and amazing food. Don't miss the tostones." u"First time here. Place was packed. We made a reservation and asked to be seated near the bar area so we could see the live band perform. The service was amazing and the food even better. I highly recommend this restaurant. Definitely a great find. The Cuban sandwich I ordered was delish so we're the appetizers we ordered Papas Rellanas and Piquillo Rellano. Your welcome. Happy eating!!" u'I order 1495  pitiful really they changed it left the same price but reduced the plate shame on you mojitos where great']
132.Ocean Prime,[u'Great service delicious meal perfect dessert - what more could we ask for?Lobster Bisque - sweet & savorySeafood Cobb Salad- perfectly seasonedSalmon Teriyaki - just right Ribeye Oscar Style - excellent' u'My first NYC restaurant week dinner yay. I started off with the Point Judith Calamari followed by the Blackened Snapper and finished off with the Five Layer Carrot Cake and some oysters. The calamari was very crispy at the beginning but got a tad soggy after sitting around for awhile on the place near the end. It reminded me of a fake sweet and sour Chinese food and I had the urge to pair it with rice. The snapper was fantastic and reminded me of fish I once had at Tamarine in Palo Alto (which made me miss California a ton). The cake was very sweet and the pineapple syrup was probably the best part.' u'The filet that I got was very dry even though it was medium rare. Just not a lot of flavor. We enjoyed the scallops and the truffle Mac and cheese. Calamari was drenched in sauce... The stuff on top was good but down near the plate was soupy and gross.' u'I had a reservation for 8:30pm dinner on a week night and arrived on time. We waited until 9pm and we were still not seated. It looked like there was a corporate event going on and the staff seemed busy. Every time we checked for an update the hostesses would tell us "just a few more minutes". My boyfriend and I were starving so we walked out and went to Capital Grille instead.I\'m sure the food would have been delicious but I\'m definitely not one to put up with THAT level of service. If you don\'t have the space or enough staff why confirm our reservation at all?' u'Amazing service. Amazing atmosphere. Amazing food. From start to finish we enjoyed dinning here. Cannot go wrong if your in the mood for surf turf or both. Our server Ryan was very knowledgeable and friendly. The staff all worked as a team and where extremely hospitable.' u"New addition to the NYC steak scene doesn't disappoint. \xa0Great renovation of the old school Ben Benson space. \xa0But the sleekness of the spot isn't all there is because they're turning out flavorful cuts of beef \xa0lead off by great starters here." u'The rooms are stunning consistent with my experience with their Beverly Hills location as well. Service was excellent I asked for a soft boiled egg instead of their standard hard boiled egg on the chopped salad the request was handled perfectly no drama - appropriate warning about a possible delay due to special request but there really want much of a delay. Overall excellent experience highly recommended if you are looking for impressive setting excellent service and above average food.' u'I am a total fan of this place ! I was here when Holly Holms was eating dinner here after her Rousey fight but that is not why I like it :)I always have a nice time when I come here. The service and drinks are great they have a great bourbon cocktail. We ordered a dozen oysters the truffle deviled eggs the rib eye and creamed spinach. The deviled eggs were awesome they were delicious. The oysters were delicious really fresh and different variety. For dessert we split the baked Alaska it was the best thing I ate all week. Sitting at the bar is pretty good too you can enjoy your meal and watch the game on a Football night. Def check it out.' u"This is by far a 5-star restaurant. Their mannerisms food presentation and atmosphere is quintessentially what a New York City restaurant is suppose to be. They also include 'Customizing' your meal to shared proportions. Do not listen or pay mind to anything ever said negatively about this place. More than likely its the writer not the venue that has a problem and brought it with them.Instead save up a little money (its not cheap but it won't break the bank either) and have a true 'Dining' experience. The Filet Mignon with the seasoned crust will force your eyes closed and dream that you are in food heaven. The Asparagus Spears has a magic dust seasoning to them. The 6-layer 'real' Carrot Cake with Pineapple Marmalade sauce will make you cry in hysterics. Go soon find a sever named Nicholas and be amazed (he's also an expert Sommelier- expert on all wines). Sally the manager will make you feel like you just walked off of the red carpet and the 'Berries & Bubbles' drink will \xa0paralysis a smile continuously on whatever face your brought in there. Watch the slightly frosted open window to the kitchen as you await every delicious drop of the best most eateries could provide times 15 brought to your table. You won't regret a minute. They will treat you like 'royalty'." u'Came here for dinner during restaurant week with my sisters and we Had a wonderful meal. The selection for restaurant week was pretty good.For appetizer I had the lobster bisque which was creamy and delicious with pieces of lobster in it. My sister had the French onion soup which was pretty good. We also had the calamari which was sweet with a bit of spice to it. And we also had the salad which my brother in law loved. The pretzel bread and the sourdough were so good. The breads were nice warm and fresh. Loved it! For the main course We had the seared scallops with risotto which was delicious! \xa0We also had the filet minion with the string beans and mash potato which was pretty good. Steak was cooked just the way we like it. For dessert we had the carrot cake with the pineapple sauce and whip creme. I thought the carrot cake was a bit on the sweet side but the tartiness of the pineapple sauce helped balance out the flavor. We also had The blood orange sorbet which was pretty good.Service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and accommodating throughout the meal.' u'definitely expensive drinks are well made and food is good. service was great pricey but it is a steakhouse. I ordered the filet which although i said medium well seemed to be cooked well done. The food took a little long but my friends and i were so deep into convo that we hadnt realized until we finished our first drinks and the waitress asked if we wanted another drink. My friend just told her ummm how about the food. the sides were to share which were decent size and protion. i would suggest if you come here make sure you have patience. Also try to pay cash because i was double charged. Aside from that it was a good dinner i enjoyed myself' u"I came here for restaurant week with no expectations but thoroughly enjoyed myself. It was very packed on a Friday at 7:00 PM and it took around 15 minutes to get seated. Although it is in a working district the clientele was diverse and the atmosphere was pretty romantic/upscale - dim lighting lots of mingling high ceiling. Once we were seated we ordered two cocktails - the Kentucky Rose ($16) and Berries and Bubbles ($17). I really enjoyed my berries and bubbles as it was quite dramatic - with dry ice and the server pouring it right in front of me. One of the highlights of my night was the bread basket that came. It was served warm and there were two different types of bread - one was pretzel-like but still soft and the other was the best sourdough bread I've ever had! I knew I should have saved room in my stomach for the rest of dinner but I almost finished the whole bread basket by myself. For the appetizer I ordered the lobster bisque which I thought was well done but was slightly too salty and had little lobster meat. For the entree I ordered the scallops with risotto. I enjoyed that the scallops were cooked perfectly and the lemon and herb seasoning that complemented both so well. As for dessert I ordered the famous carrot cake which definitely met expectations - it was moist and the frosting was not too sweet but I actually preferred the peanut butter pie more (I'm partial to chocolate mousse done well). I would come here again on a special occasion to splurge on the full menu as I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food." u'Ocean Prime overall score: 88I rolled through Ocean Prime for a quick NYC Restaurant Week meal one night after work with a friend of mine. They were booked solid so we grabbed a seat in the lounge area near the bar to eat. While the menu was limited to a small filet for restaurant week (in terms of beef) I figured it was a good opportunity to test-drive the steakhouse before going balls-deep with a big rib eye. Here\'s what I thought:Flavor: 9The filet was delicious and was cooked to an absolutely perfect medium rare. It had a good seasoned outside and the inside was juicy and flavorful. While the outside wasn\'t super crisp it still managed to hold in all the juices.I\'m looking forward to heading back for a proper rib eye. I have to say... for a place to score an 88 on a test run with a severely limited restaurant week menu... I\'m impressed.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 7Three filets two strips and a rib eye are offered here. There is no beef porterhouse. I have to take a few points for that. The menu indicates that all steaks are prime quality but nothing is noted about aging. Perhaps a few more bone-in options would also beef up the selection here as well.Portion Size & Plating: 8Portions are slightly smaller than most places for the price range of midtown steak joints. The plating is elegant and clean nothing too fancy.Price: 8This is an expensive joint with a small 8oz filet coming in at almost $50 however their most expensive steak is $57 a 12oz "bone-in filet" so the range isn\'t too wide. In any case they do participate in NYC Restaurant Week where they offer a three-course meal for $38 that includes an app an entree two sides and a dessert.Bar: 10This is a great bar for hanging out after work. The crowd is all suits from Bankville USA but the space is beautifully apportioned and you can watch the street from the well-lit seating arrangement.Specials and Other Meats: 8There\'s lamb chicken and a pork porterhouse in terms of other meats. That\'s a nice showing especially considering that this place is a bit lighter on the beef selections and a bit heavier on the seafood selections.Apps Sides & Desserts: 9I had the Point Judith calamari which was perfectly breaded and fried to a golden crisp and drizzled with just the right amount of sweet chili sauce. It also comes with roasted cashews which nails home the distinct Asian dimension to the dish.My steak came with mashed potatoes and green beans for the restaurant week menu so I got to taste a few items. Both were good but nothing incredible.The desserts however were a different story. I tried both the peanut butter mousse with chocolate ganache and the carrot cake which Ocean Prime is famous for at this point. Del Frisco\'s has the lemon cake. Strip House has the chocolate cake. Ocean Prime has the carrot cake which i shy far my favorite and I DO love the lemon cake at Del\'s. Typically the cake is 10 layers high and a massive wedge. This restaurant week portion was just right for me as I was already kind of full. The frosting had a great fall-spice to it and the cake was moist without being too dense.The peanut butter and chocolate pie was good too but too sweet for my liking. It was light due to the mousse element though which is nice. It was also beautiful to look at.Seafood Selection: 10There\'s a shitload of great looking seafood here. The menu is too extensive to list them all. I was able to try some of the scallops that my buddy ordered and so far I\'m impressed.When I return I\'ll definitely be trying more seafood. I like the idea of a steak joint that really raises the bar on the seafood. A lot of places just do lobster and salmon shrimp and oysters. They don\'t go outside the box. Here it is a totally different seafood experience. And it is perfect place for dates: the men can eat their red meat and the women can watch their figure with some seafood because sexism rules.Service: 10Even in the busy and crowded bar area we had excellent service. The first course came out fast and the waitress Jenny was really nice and attentive. The fun part about sitting in the bar area is that they give you a free bowl of popcorn which is wonderfully seasoned. The bread by the way is delicious. You get piping hot pretzel bread logs and bread with a soft whipped butter. Excellent.Ambiance: 9While the main dining room is a big cast and industrial looking it still has a nice feel to it. It\'s spacious which is good but it just lacks a little bit of character. One thing that\'s cool is that \xa0you can view how the kitchen operates by peeking though the long glass window that is visible from the dining room.' u'Hubby and I went here for our anniversary dinner and the food and staff were amazing! My husband had the sea bass and I had the lamb chops and let\'s just say we cleaned our plates! Our waiter knew it was our anniversary and our dessert reflected that also the table was decorated in "happy anniversary" confetti. Very nice and romantic! Will definitely visit again!' u"Oh wow... coming to Ocean Prime is like stepping into the suburbs. \xa0It doesn't feel like you're in NYC but instead you're back at that restaurant which was the best place to go for special occasions in whatever suburb you grew up in. \xa0The food follows the same theme in that you'll get exactly what you expect when ordering. \xa0Within blocks of Ocean Prime is Michelin star restaurant Le Bernandin and Michelin star restaurant The Modern (added bonus that it's inside the MoMA). \xa0In terms of direct competitors there's Oceana serving high quality seafood (and oddly awesome bar food). \xa0Plus you have Del Friscos Quality Meats and Maloney & Porcelli to consider for steakhouses. \xa0 Mastro's is literally across the street. \xa0With these kind of options I needed something to stand out in order to have a reason to return." u"This place has tough competition as Mastro's Steakhouse is on the other side of the street. I need to come back here for the steak but the seafood here was great!" u'It isn\'t often you get to say that you had a restaurant experience that was perfect from beginning to end but my experience at Ocean Prime was one of them. \xa0I was meeting a group for a birthday dinner but I arrived early. \xa0This allowed me to spend some time at the bar enjoying a couple drinks beforehand. \xa0The hostess was immediately welcoming and after a quick coat check I hung out at the bar to enjoy my cocktail. \xa0I had the Whiskey Clover described on the menu as "Gentleman Jack Whiskey Hennessy VS Honey WaterHand-Squeezed Lemon & Orange". \xa0You\'d think with a description like that the drink would\'ve been overly sweet but instead it was just the right balance of citrus sweetness and whiskey flavor. \xa0I really enjoyed it.As I sat at the bar I looked around the bar area which includes several comfortable circular booths and tall tables. \xa0The bar area alone could accommodate a party. \xa0The decor manages the hat trick of looking sophisticated but not pretentious. \xa0The combination of dark wood white counters medium tone furniture and dim lighting creates a comfortable atmosphere that feels rich but not in an off putting manner. \xa0The environment lends itself to everything from after work drinks with colleagues to a date.Eventually my friends began to arrive and we all got to talking - so much so we didn\'t realize that it was taking a rather long time to get to our table (we had a reservation - I highly recommend you make one). \xa0The manager came up to us and was very gracious offering us the use of the private dining room near the bar area (dubbed the "Rockefeller Room") since they had made us wait so long. \xa0We of course accepted and happily sat down for a very different experience than we had expected!The Rockefeller Room could easily accommodate a small office party of about 10-12 people. \xa0There is a large round table with a huge lazy susan in the middle. \xa0There is a flat screen TV mounted on the wall and tasteful decor is the order of the day in the brightly lit room. \xa0Our waiter was absolutely professional and on point the entire night. \xa0It wasn\'t just a matter of making sure our glasses were full of water. \xa0His manner and event he way he addressed us spoke volumes about the training the staff had gone through. \xa0We were all very impressed.Okay enough talk about the room and bar etc. \xa0What did I eat? \xa0Here\'s a list of what I got to have:FILET MIGNONNot wanting to be a complete glutton I went with the 8oz filet mignon medium rare. \xa0The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. \xa0While you can order items on top of the steak such as black truffle butter I wanted it straight to taste it in its most pure form. \xa0I\'m really glad I did. \xa0When I cut the meat it was like butter and it was perfectly tender. \xa0There was just the right amount of seasoning to make your taste buds happy but not overwhelm them. \xa0It was also truly medium rare with pink in the middle.JALAPENO AU GRATINA side dish this comes in a rather large bowl and there was enough that all six people at the dinner were able to get a couple forkfuls of this spicy dish. \xa0Jalapenos generally can go two ways: either there is a kick or there isn\'t. \xa0In this dish there definitely was along with some savory flavor.PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIESOther restaurants have this and I\'ve had it many times. \xa0Most of the time they are shoestring fries and there\'s not a lot of substance to them. \xa0Not so here! \xa0These fries were *huge* and the cheese layer was obvious from several feet away. \xa0These were absolutely addicting. \xa0Be warned you can\'t just eat a couple!CREAMED SPINACHWhat could have been a typical creamed spinach is elevated by a smokey element inside the dish. \xa0Most of us agreed it was likely bacon but there were no bacon bits to be found. \xa0Whatever the case may be this was a very uncommon creamed spinach that was full of flavor.BLACK TRUFFLE MAC N\' CHEESEI only got to have one bite of this but it was full of flavor. \xa0The cheese was creamy and salty and the truffle flavor was definitely assertive. \xa0TEN LAYER CARROT CAKEA signature dessert this cake was *truly* 10 layers. \xa0It was a literal tower of goodness. \xa0The cake was so moist that you could push a fork through all ten layers and it didn\'t tip over. \xa0It tasted delicious and surprisingly had no raisins in it.CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER PIEPeanut Butter Mousse and Bittersweet Chocolate Ganache \xa0come together to make one of the most delicious desserts I\'ve had in ages. \xa0The mousse is perfectly delicate but full of flavor while the ganache gives just the right amount of sweetness to balance the savory mousse. \xa0Special shout out to the coffee and bread basket - both of which could easily be overlooked in any restaurant but here they were exceptional. \xa0The bread basket had amazing pretzel sticks (fresh baked!) and the coffee was french pressed!I really enjoyed my experience at Ocean Prime and I can\'t wait to go back!' u"Came here on a whim after being turned away at 2 club for 'athletic looking clothing' (leggings and boots with a jacket is athletic now?! whatever) anyway walking away we were hungry cold and looking for ANYTHING and literally walked across the street and into Ocean Prime. So glad we did!We were seated right away and someone came and took drink orders. We were a group of three and ended up with 2 soups and a salad as appetizer. The french onion soup was huge enough to share but a bit skimpy on the cheese for the $13 price tag. The house salad looked good no complaints there. The two men shared the 24oz porterhouse special and mashed potatoes and I got the grouper. It was a really generous serving of fish in a light lemon butter sauce with gnocchi (which was handmade) and pieces of lobster. I ate very small bites as I wanted to savor as long as possible! I got a bite of the porter and it was also very well cooked tender and perfect temperature. The mashed potatoes were eh nothing spectacular. We only ordered vanilla ice cream for dessert but it melted as we waited to be brought a spoon. It wasn't anything great not Haagen Daz (which for the price I expected) but tasted more like Breyers. I get it it's vanilla ice cream what did we expect but something creamier rather than icy. Oh well.Overall service was ok our waitress didnt seem to listen to well (i asked to recommendations between the salmon and the grouper....she recommended the filet mignon. Someone else asked for recommendation between the french onion soup and the lobster bisque....she recommended the tuna tartar. that kinda thing.)Overall it was a great meal. Worth the price tag? Probably not to be honest I've had better for cheaper." u"I will mention that I was here for a 1-month anniversary social media influencer party so it may not be 100% accurate as to a typical meal.First thing I noticed was the level of professionalism of the staff. The front receptionists greeted us warmly and directed us to the coat check. The lady running the coat check was very friendly and we had a short chat. Then we walked into the glass room in the back where the Sips and Seafood event was being held. We enjoyed pretty much an open bar and the waiter Channing was one of the most knowledgeable servers I have ever met. I wasn't drinking too much that night but I listened to his descriptions and recommendations for all the whiskey drinkers at my table and poured them exactly what they were looking for. I ordered the Berries and Bubbles mostly because the dry ice and floating blueberries looked so cool.The food was over-the-top phenomenal. Starting with some raw tuna bites the evening transpired into a culinary gourmet buffet as spicy tuna rolls lobster rolls crab cakes beef sliders fried calimari and more rolled into the room. There was a sushi chef in the back who made pretty much an unlimited quantity of sushi and our servers kept our drinks full to the brim. The Lamb Chops Lollipops without exaggeration was the best lamb dish I have ever tried. It had absolutely zero gamey taste to the point that I thought it was beef at first. Very moist and juicy the lollipops are full of flavor (I'd say maybe an Asian marinade?). Then came the gargantuan chilled seafood towers stuffed with crab meat crab legs shrimp and lobster. They were seriously rolling out the red carpet here. The seafood was all very fresh and plentiful - two towers were enough for a room of 15+.They also brought out some lobster mashed potatoes and savory truffle mac-and-cheese. One of the hostesses told us that the mac was crack. And it was. We were piling it onto our plates as though the world was ending. The mac-and-cheese definitely stole the show.Make sure you save room for dessert because their spread is unbeatable. The delicious peanut butter pie baked alaska and 10-layer carrot cake were no laughing matter. While all three were made to perfection it was the carrot cake that made me fall in love. Normally I dislike carrot cake because of its dry crumby taste but Ocean Prime's was excellent. The pineapple syrup poured over the top loosens up the cake and creates a wonderful sweet experience.The wonderful staff beautiful ambiance and perfect food are just some of the few reasons to check out Ocean Prime!" u'My fiance and I went here last night for restaurant week. \xa0Even though we had a reservation for 7:15 we weren\'t seated until 7:30 which surprised us considering the room we were seated in was only half full. \xa0So we sat at the bar and ordered a drink. \xa0My fiance had a glass of the Malbec Terrazas de los Andes Reserva \xa0Mendoza Argentina 2012 and I had the Merlot Sterling "Vintner\'s Collection" Central Coast California 2013 - both were excellent. \xa0Once we were seated she had the lobster bisque and I had the french onion soup. Both were good but we thought the french onion was better as the lobster bisque barely had any lobster in it. \xa0We each had the 6 oz filet mignon as our main course. \xa0It was amazing and I inhaled mine however I think they were very cheap with the portions and I honestly think the filet was really 4-5 oz instead which really annoyed us. \xa0This is why I cannot rate this place 5 stars.For dessert we each had the 5 layer carrot cake which was delicious and really hit the spot. \xa0It was very rich and had this amazing pineapple glaze. \xa0Also I forgot to mention how once we were seated I ordered a Kentucky Rose. \xa0This was definitely one of the best mixed drinks I\'ve ever had. \xa0My fiance ordered whichever Cabernet was on the restaurant week menu for $12. \xa0This was quite possibly the worst glass of wine we each have ever had. \xa0It felt like crumbling up $12 and throwing it down the toilet. \xa0Anyway this place is definitely worth trying and will be satisfying. \xa0Just avoid whichever wine is on the restaurant week menu.']
70.Esanation,[u"Thursday night and was trying to find an uncrowded Thai place in the neighborhood. When we came across this neon entrance thought it was a club but turned out to be a relatively empty restaurant. Easily got a table for two.Not sure if we were just really hungry or if the food is actually this good. Ordered the E8 - Pad Ped Pla Dook ($16); a spicy catfish fry marinated in red curry and brimming with sauteed veggies. The sauce is extremely flavorful; the right amount of spice and basil with not too much salt. The catfish (even with the bone in) is served generously and you're left pretty full by the end of it. To drink got the Jpop white peach ($5) - a sort of spritzer that was light enough to go with the meal.Service here was certainly quick - we got our food 10ish minutes after ordering. Quality didn't suffer at all despite this. Would certainly come back here; wish they'd do away with the neon." u'Worst meal from our trip. Terrible service: Forgot our drinks delivered the wrong food to our table and acted indignant when after they walked away without giving us a chance to tell them we politely gave it to the guests it was intended for right next to us took away our silverware before our next course and never brought us any more and never once asked how we were doing. The food was equally terrible: The papaya salad with shrimp "ceviche" came with a mound of RAW shrimp on top (yes it was raw and not "cooked" in citrus as ceviche should be) the rice dish was covered in too much of a sticky sweet sauce that completely drowned out any other flavor and the rolls were filled with an unidentifiable mushy goo that bore no resemblance to the ingredients listed on the menu.Stay far far away.' u"I think in New York you get a little spoiled on what you expect from a Thai restaurant but most specifically we all take for granted the lunch special. Amirite? Every Thai spot I've been to (and my fat face has seen a plenty) offers a lunch special and typically everyday.There are no lunch specials at Esanation. Prices are a little higher than normal with proteins of course driving the range in fare. I tried the crab and pork street noodle dish which came with a side of salty soup broth. The crab was fairly plentiful (but flavorless) but the five pieces of pork were sad shriveled and dried beyond belief. Like whatever you believe to be dry it's beyond that. For $14 skip this place altogether and go to Pure Thai Cookhouse (just on the next block over) and get their ratchaburi noodles. My friend's pad thai was a sad little plate of oversauced limp noodles and sparse vegetables. Service was spotty. We should've taken the hint on the empty restaurant and skipped it too." u"The food is decent and the service is good. Nothing to rave about though. The place itself looks really classy and cool but it's still casual enough to allow me entrance with my workout clothes on. I noticed our table was the only one without a pretty pink (fake) lily so I grabbed the one off of the unoccupied table next to us. Later the busboy came and took the lily away to make space for the food. Lol. I tried to ask him back for it but he walked pretty quickly. I had to steal it back from the counter where he put it. It's all about ambience people! I love the atmosphere in here." u"This review is based on delivery so I'm only hoping that their in restaurant dining is on a completely different level to garner such a high star rating on Yelp! We ordered based on the high rating on seamless as well. Our order was really quite simple steamed vegetable dumplings they were deflated and the meager filling spilled out of all of them and they were topped with burnt garlic. The chicken paid Thai was easily the sorriest looking pad Thai I've ever seen a few tiny pieces of chicken and one blob of scrambled egg all on top of what looked like angel hair pasta?!! I ordered the Pad Kee Mao with vegetarian duck. The flavor wasn't so bad but it was swimming in so much oil it was inedible! Easily the worst Thai food delivery yet to date in NYC." u"It's yet another Thai restaurant along 9th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen but Esanation is an addition to our favorite restaurants in the area since they specialize with Esan cuisine. As a matter of fact we ate here twice in less than a week.We loved the un-Americanized spiciness of the dishes and since they do not have a liquor license yet it's BYOB! (Tip: no corkage fee). The outside restaurant decor easily catches customers' attention while the vibe is modern and cozy. The staff are helpful and close by at all times.Since it's a family style dinner our group of five started with a big pot of Tom Zabb soup with seafood; it's mushroom tomatoes Thai basil and lemongrass broth based soup. It was delicious and the portions were perfect for the group. We then tried Somtum Mua Sua as an appetizer; it's basic papaya salad with shrimp BBQ pork crispy pork rind and vermicelli noodles. It was the dinner's star of the night. The presentation was on point and it was delicious and well plated.For my main entree I chose crispy pork belly saut\xe9ed in spicy basil sauce served with Jasmine rice. It was flavorful and the spiciness was just perfect for my palate.This place is really a good place for date nights and weekend dinner fun." u"Very limited vegetarian options. Portions are small. Pricey. Quality is mediocre. Most other Thai places have vegan & vegetarian choices. So if you're going with a party of people ... Go some place else. Lots of choices on 9th avenue." u"After being left unsatisfied with today's Thai order at another restaurant I backtracked through my bank account charges struggling to find which place I had ordered from earlier this year...it was Esanation! I remember the perfection in my order here. I ordered the L2 Lunch special: Steamed Jasmine rice w/shrimp in spicy basil sauce. Selected mild as the spice level and it was just right. Came with the Larb (Spicy ground chicken salad) which was a new dish for me and yum! Portions were just enough to be satiated and not overstuffed. The flavor in the entree was superb with a good amount of shrimp. Garlic-y basil-y sweet yet spicy. I think I've found my fave Thai for delivery in NYC." u'It is surprising to me why this restaurant is not busier. Even in Hell\'s Kitchen this is one of better Thai restaurants together with Pure and Wondee. As its name suggests Its menu focuses on "esan" (usually romanized as "isan") or northeastern Thai food. So forget about padthai.The restaurant was set up and managed by a former chef of Zabb Elee. And I believe that because the spice level and flavor nuances did remind me of the glorious time at Zabb Elee in Queens before it was under a new management.Its Somtum (papaya salad) was slightly mushy but still great. A perfect companion was grilled pork which had the right ratio of fat to meat. Gang Om was thick enough and full of herbs.All of these dishes were also presentable. Although neon lights seemed a bit too kitschy and haphazard for my taste the decoration was not bad either. I would recommend going there early and sitting by one of two huge windows to avoid club-like lighting. However I will definitely go back even when both tables are booked. Pure and Wondee are always packed anyway.' u'Everything we had were salty especially fresh crab papaya salad Som Tum Lao with fresh Crab $12.95. Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) with chicken and Khao Kha Moo (pork) were sadly below average and very salty and not have a punch of flavors that I expect from Thai food. My friend from Chiang Mai said the same thing: "salty!"' u'The previous reviews are correct. This place is beyond tasty. We ordered way too much food. Oh well. For the appetizer we ordered the sun-dried pork with a sweet siracha sauce. Yum. The husband ordered a sliced pork dish. I ordered the whole red snapper with a sweet garlic siracha sauce. Yes I enjoy siracha. And we did dessert. Two scoops of coconut ice cream with jackfruit and peanuts on some sort of bun. Very different but tasty.' u"Very unassuming Thai restaurant in the Hells Kitchen area. At first I thought this was a club looking from the outside in. You'll see why if you go in at night. We stumbled upon Esanation after the other Thai restaurant we initially planned on going to had an hour wait. I'm pretty sure we didn't miss out on much in regards to the quality because Esanation was legit. The food was very flavorful and the portions were just perfect for me. There wasn't much people when we first walked in but as the night wore on more and more people started to trickle in. The service was good as well. They came by and cleared our tables frequently and made sure our waters were filled. Will definitely try this place again whenever I'm back in the City!" u"I love Thai food especially seafood though I'm not an expert on regional differences in the cuisine. The ambience here is different than any other Thai place where I've eaten dinner this one I'd expect to have found at the Aria in Vegas. But the food is all Thai not Vegasized or Americanized. I've had both whole snapper dishes chili sauce and garlic sauce and both were delicious spicy to the level a former New Orleans resident likes and a beautifully presented whole fish with most of the meat cut off and placed next to the body (that description not very good see my photo!) My daughter who is quite the foodie for a teenager for some reason got the basic pad thai but it was also quite good. A definite recommendation amongst the 9th Avenue Thai restaurants." u"First impression of Esanation - Modern Thai. The blue neon light at the front entrance along with the contemporary decor and bar/lounge-like ambiance from the inside suggest modern/fusion-theme cuisine but the menu uniquely features Street Food. So which is it?In comparison with other Thai restaurants along 9th Avenue Esanation certainly spiced up its flavors which I feel it's true to its origin. But the portions were smaller than most and pricier than others as well." u"My husband and I popped in here after coming from Port Authority and we loved it. We were immediately attracted to the beautiful interior. We've been knee deep in our own apt renovations so we appreciated that the restaurant hired a highly talented interior designer to set the tone for the place. We're both vegan and the waiter was very helpful in pointing our the veg dishes made with fish sauce and ones that are fried with non-veg items. That didn't leave us with a large selection but we really enjoyed the basil mock duck and veg fried rice! They have some long areas so I'm sure they'd have no problem accommodating larger parties. I'd come back here I have no reason not to!" u"A good Thai option in Hell Kitchen area. They have your typical Pad Thai and fried rice dishes. The street food menu section is a bit lost on me since most items seem fairly normal and found in most typical Thai menus in the city. The food is good both their noodles in and out of soup. The whole Cornish hen is nice if you're into Cornish hens. The whole red snapper was pretty huge. An entire fish fried and served with rice and some veggies. It's a good dinner choice if you're not adverse to seeing the head of the fish pointed at you as you dine on the meat. Place looks nice and new. I went in thinking that the neon lights by the door would bother me throughout my meal but it wasn't really visible from the inside so it wasn't a problem. Friendly staff and not a very loud sort of crowd." u"First time in New York and I've tried other Thai places and they were all packed. Stumbled across this restaurant and it was amazing. The customer service was great and food and drinks came out fast. The food was great and authentic." u'Went in on Tuesday May 3rd 2016 .. The decor is interesting. \xa0I think it\'s kinda cool actually. \xa0All the seats at the table are a little bit too low in my opinion. \xa0It kinda makes you feel like a little kid at the adult\'s table and I\'m 5\'6" -I don\'t think I\'m too short. \xa0LOL ^^ \xa0So for me I was a little uncomfortable during dinner. \xa0But that\'s just my opinion though. \xa0The service is nice and attentive. \xa0They are well with filling your water glasses. \xa0They walk by at each course to check if everything is okay. \xa0They clear out empty plates. \xa0So it\'s very nice of them not forgetting or ignoring the customers. \xa0We ordered -- Spring Rolls - Not your usual spring rolls. \xa0They come in four long crispy skinny rolls which are already different from your usual spring rolls from other Thai restaurants. \xa0My son loves them. \xa0He said the vegetable stuffings are really tasty. \xa0- Chicken Curry Puffs - 4 in a serving. \xa0I\'m not so fond of them. \xa0They were just okay. \xa0I didn\'t taste the chicken. \xa0The stuffings are very soft and mushy. \xa0- Steamed Chicken and Shrimp dumpling - They are great. \xa0You can taste the meat. \xa0It comes with the sweet soy sauce I believe. \xa0But I didn\'t dip in any. \xa0- Esan Pork Sausage - This is great! \xa0Taste just like the one in Thailand. \xa0It could have use some lettuce wrap I believe. \xa0But even without that it still is great. \xa0- Somtum Thai - One word .. Awesome! \xa0I didn\'t order it very spicy cuz the rest of my group can\'t have them. \xa0I personally love spicy food. \xa0I\'m not complaining -next time I\'ll order spicy one just for myself. \xa0=) - Crab and Roast Pork Noodles - Just plain amazing. \xa0Lots of crabmeat. \xa0- Yentafo Noodles Soup - It comes with fishballs squid shrimp and mussels. \xa0So lots of seafood there. And the broth tastes great. \xa0Love it! \xa0- Tom Yum Noodles Soup - I always love this! \xa0In any restaurant if they have this dish I will order. \xa0And I was not disappointed. \xa0It was tasty and yummy. \xa0The rest of my group ordered other dishes-- Pork Neck - Pad Thai Noodles - Crab Fried Rice - Kao Kana Moo Grob- Kao Ka Moo I would not go into details on these since I haven\'t really tasted them. \xa0But my friends said they were all great. \xa0So Thank You Esanation for a great meal! \xa0I\'m glad I decided to walk in and try. \xa0=) We\'ll be back. \xa0=) =)' u'??? Food aint look like in the picture. i want to give it 1 star but thats fucked up. I just took a bite of the skewers very dissapointing... fuck that im giving 1 star. The portions are so small for the price and the sukiyaki my sister ordered smells like ass and taste like dirt. Im so mad right now. If you looking to just waste money and possibly throw up this is the spot. Ps a fly landed on my fork im out beware yelp users' u"this place is pretty tasty. the menu was a bit different from what i usually see at thai places i.e. there were no curries but that was ok as there were still a TON of other choices between noodles salads rice etc. so tried to order some alcohol but it doesn't appear this place has its liquor license no bar. but it was also not advertised as a BYOB... so a bit confused on how to address this if i want to come back and have some kind of adult beverage with my meal... onto the food. per yelp highlights we ordered the grilled pork neck for an appetizer. this was quite tasty with great seasoning and grill taste served with a spicy chili dipping sauce. for entrees we shared pad thai with chicken and crispy pork belly in spicy basil sauce that had sliced bell peppers and onions served with a side of sticky rice. these were both really good. the pad thai noodles were a bit different than what i've had before they were more like angel hair than the typical flat noodle. the dish was still very flavorful and a generous portion with lots of chicken. the crispy pork belly entree was also nice just have a small complaint as there were some pieces of pork belly that were so CRISP they literally crumbled into dust when you attempted to eat it. i'd feel comfortable ordering delivery from here so that i can eat it with some wine in the comfort of my home."]
163.Ted’s Montana Grill,[u"Came to Ted's Montana Grill with a group of seven. One star knocked off mainly because the hosts were not friendly nor were they welcoming when we walked in. We even considered leaving but since we were already there and we were told the food was good we stayed.After being seated our friendly waitress took our drink orders. I went with the Lemon Drop Martini (Tito's vodka Cointreau and lemonade). SO good I had another. Others got Hendrick's Mule Vodka Water w/ Lime and a few beers they had on draft. We were all very satisfied with our drinks!As for food we all ordered burgers. I ordered the Avalon bison burger cooked at medium. It was a little over done but the gruyere blue cheese arugula carmelized onions and roasted garlic aioli saved it. The cheese was amazing and I LOVE arugula so this burger was a great fit for my taste buds. I ate most of the burger before I started feeling like a potato. Speaking of potatoes the french fries on the plate were pretty standard but I ate all of them so no complaints here. Cool first-time experience especially because of the drinks and great company!" u'Visiting NYC pre-Broadway-show meal. \xa0We were going to go casual at Ellen\'s Stardust line was too long Ted\'s Montana Grill was just down the street and within easy range of Gershwin Theatre.Food overall was decent to good service was severely lacking. \xa0 Started with house Caesar salad. \xa0The ingredients were fresh yet the dressing was very bland. \xa0i.e. it lacked the flavor and \'zing\' of a regular Caesar dressing. \xa0The fact that it was eggless as stated in the menu should not have accounted for lack of discernable Caesar flavor. \xa0Daughter got roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and carrots. I tried the carrots they had nice texture and flavor. \xa0I had the veggie burger and salt & pepper onion rings. \xa0I liked that they had horseradish cheddar cheese available for the burger. \xa0Don\'t come across it often and I jumped at the chance to have it on the burger. \xa0Burger held its consistency well compared to other veggie burgers. \xa0Overall the food was decent to good with the one exception of the Caesar salad dressing.Service is where this visit gets bad marks. \xa0Upon being seated right away (good) there was too long of a wait for our first contact by server. Around 6-7 minute range. \xa0Other servers not ours were continually coming in the general area. \xa0It was getting to the "do you know who the server for this table is" question to anyone who could be flagged down when our server appeared.The server got our orders correct. \xa0The issue was in the service itself. \xa0After delivering our order they largely disappeared. \xa0Proactively checked on us only once the entire meal. \xa0Had to flag down twice for condiments flag down another time for water. \xa0I also noticed at one point they disappeared around the corner by the bathrooms and didn\'t appear again for about 10-12 minutes. \xa0Smoke break phone texting/call break? \xa0When they did come to our table theiir disposition was hurried and rushed instead of inquisitive and service-oriented. \xa0Example: \xa0we were in the latter half of eating but weren\'t finished yet. \xa0During the one time they checked on us they approached and asked "All done?" instead of "how is everything?" "may I get you anything else?" "will you be wanting to look at a dessert menu?" "Will you be needing a to-go box later?" etc. \xa0 \xa0Later during another extended absence from our table another server cleared our places.In short the service was largely absent and when server did come by there was verbiage and nonverbals of rushing us. \xa0Food overall was decent service severely lacking. \xa0When back in the area first look will be for somewhere else to eat. \xa0Wish the establishment the best the service was a bit too paltry for an establishment with this atmosphere and this price range.' u"Came in here with some co-workers for lunch the other day. We had heard that the burgers were delicious so we wanted to check it out. We ordered right away and got a variation of burgers. I had the duo that contained two 3 oz burgers (one bison one beef) and fries. It was decent but very plain. For $16 I was hoping for a bit more.The ambiance is nice. The place is pretty big and has a large bar off to the side. We had a few tables around us but you never felt like you were on top of anyone else. Service was terrible. Our waitress took our order almost immediately but we waited over 1 hr for our food to come. She never came over to give us a status update and our waters were filled infrequently. When the food finally came we were ignored most of time again.The burgers are good but it's not worth the price tag or the bad service." u"This was my second time at Ted's for lunch. \xa0Excellent speedy service and mouth watering dishes. I decided to try one of the burgers this time around. My first visit I had the sirloin steakhitch was very good. If you are going for a burger \xa0I highly recommend the Avalon Burger--Carmelized onions bacon Gruyere and may tag cheese. Very tasty combo. No complaints from me although I do think it's a bit pricey. Luckily both times I've gone it's been on someone else's dime." u'2 starts only because of fast service. I came in with two people for lunch. We were seated and given menus. I was surprised with the burger selection. We all ordered burgers. I asked for medium-rare thinking they might overcook it but then switched to medium hoping the steakhouse should to grill meat to the right temperature. Two things that I personally think mater in burger is - bun and quality meat cooked to the right temperature. Both failed. Bun had absolutely no taste and the meat was overcooked. Was very disappointed.' u"Brought 13 people here for a work dinner and everyone was very pleased. \xa0The food is not necessarily the most interesting or flashy that you might have but it's very tasty served hot and fast and the service was top notch. \xa0Our server kept everyone in drinks checked up on us often and made the terrific service seem effortless.I had a salt and pepper trout which was very good along with a salt crusted baked potato that was pretty exceptional.The burgers received raves from those who had it. \xa0The bison and french fries were also rated well. \xa0This is a pretty good place and you won't be disappointed!" u"AMAZING! CONSISTENT! If you are in the area you need to check this place out! The food is delicious! The service is impeccable! You can't go wrong!!!!" u"I recently had lunch at Ted's Montana Grill and overall it was forgettable. \xa0I had a bison burger and my sister had sliders and bison chili. \xa0Our food was okay nothing particularly interesting and my fries were kind of limp and didn't help add to my meal. \xa0It's someplace that you can eat at in a pinch if you're hungry but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.Ambience: \xa0The restaurant is spacious nothing too fancy but suitable to the Midtown work crowd.Food: We just had burgers and a side of chili which unfortunately didn't impress us much.Value: \xa0A tad bit pricey like everything else in the area. \xa0Honestly nearly every restaurant between Times Square and Rockefeller center is pretty much ho-hum and overpriced.Service: Okay. \xa0Our waitress was attentive and prompt.Location: Near Rockefeller Center." u'I came here recently for Restaurant Week dinner and enjoyed it though I feel like they skimped on the appetizers only offering salad or soup but I did like the soup. It consisted of sausage vegetables and rice sprinkled on top. It was pretty tasty with plenty of flavor.The main course was steak with Parmesan fries. The steak was delicious -- Juicy with butter on top and cooked perfectly in its own sauce. The fries were wonderful as well. Very fresh fluffy and served warm. For dessert I had the brownie with vanilla ice cream coffee and caramel syrup flavoring as well as some whipped cream on the top. This was extremely sweet rich decadent delectable and it was a huge serving! I enjoyed the chocolate-y flavor with the caramel coffee and ice cream... Everything melded together perfectly.Overall a good experience... Large serving sizes and nice service.' u'Went here before seeing "School of Rock" on Broadway with elder parents two kids and a wife who doesn\'t eat carbs. Found it to be a great place - upscale without being pretentious and something for everyone on the menu.The decor is classic steakhouse with private booths white tablecloths and large windows that look out onto the street.The service was excellent- we told the server we had a short amount of time due to arriving late (and needing to make the show time) and she was attentive responsive and friendly throughout. The kids menus included Wikki Sticks which are fun bendable pieces of plastic (instead of crayons + paper) that kept the kids entertained throughout the meal. Better still the kids menu food was above average with good portions and quality.The adults\' meals were all great - salads were large and fresh; veggie burger wasn\'t a standout but was definitely filling and well-sized. Yes we came to a steakhouse and ate salads and a veggie burger though my 12-year-old son ordered the child\'s menu steak and gave it 4/5 stars.' u"I had been here before for an event. \xa0I couldn't wait to return. \xa0I am sad to say my own visit was nothing like what I had expected. We thought the price fix menu for plays was a great option. \xa0I didn't see any times online so I assumed it was available any time. \xa0We had to eat after our show due to an occasion we attended before. \xa0So we switched our reservation to 10:30 instead our initial 6pm reservation.Upon arrival I asked if we still could do the price fix. \xa0The hostess was very friendly and said yes. \xa0She gave us the restaurant week menu. \xa0This menu is $3 more than their price fix menu and didn't have the crab cakes and steak on it that sounded good. \xa0I asked the waitress if we could do the price fix menu for before shows. \xa0She said during restaurant week they only run the restaurant week menu. \xa0So let me get this straight they downgrade the menu and charge $3 more?! In my mind I thought that's poor business. \xa0I asked the waitress if they could honor the items on their regular price fix. \xa0She appeared annoyed. \xa0I said I don't eat much steak so maybe she can explain the steak options to me. \xa0In a snarky tone she barely described the items and was rushing us to order. \xa0She said her manager wouldn't honor their normal price fix and we had to order ASAP. \xa0We rushed to order so much so that my boyfriend felt guilty ordering a drink but I insisted he order. To begin they bring out pickles. \xa0The pickles were good. \xa0I had a Caesar salad it had a very light dressing with tasty croutons and some cheese. \xa0It was mediocre. \xa0The meat dish I ordered was chewy/grizzly at points but mostly tender. \xa0Both our meats were a bit rare which we didn't order. \xa0The fries were just warm not hot. \xa0The highlight for me was the brownie dessert.At this point I'm sad to say I'm not sure we'd return. \xa0The poor attitude raised/revised menu for restaurant week and snarky waitress less left than a desirable taste in our mouth for our $130 bill. \xa0I'd like to think my first experience was more true to what they are but I'm not sure we will return to ever find out." u"After seeing Star Wars The Force Awakens with a good friend in Times Square she suggested burgers at Ted's. Being a huge burger fan I heartily agreed.I had the traditional bacon and cheddar cheese burger with steak fries. Good lord that was amazing! Succulent beef perfectly cooked to order with fries to die for. The service was excellent and the food came pretty quickly. It took about a half hour to get a table but they let us sit at the bar and gave us complimentary soft drinks while we waited. The crowd eased up considerably by the time our food arrived.A really great experience and I'd head back anytime." u'Amazing night! Ted welcomed a huge group of us yelpers to sample their fantastic menu!! Ted is a chain with a history and it is really cool to know that your meat is fresh cut and prepared from A to Z right on the premises. Not that many places can say the same... There was so much to try! - the trout dip was first and perfectly paired with corn chips and baked toasts. - then came the crab cakes- delicious and very meaty! - the corn was good but it was my least favorite...- the salmon was delicious could definitely taste the woody cedar flavor in the fish! - the steak was the piece of resistance! Medium cooked and generous portions! Yuuuuummmmmm- the fries could have been a little crispier - the sliders were paired with the onion ring. Yummy! - dessert was warm chocolate brownies and we all left with bags of homemade cookies!! The event was amazing! Thank you so much to Ted for hosting such a magnificent and generous table for us! I am a big fan :)' u"Bad service and worse food. The only thing saving this restaurant from a 1 star fate was that my father enjoyed his burger which was our whole point in coming here.I ordered the filet and the meat was very flavorless as well as grisly. On top of this the waitress was so rude and curt to me I was actually afraid to ask her for some mustard so I could even get the meat down. My wine was also awful and overpriced it tasted very cheap.Worst meal I've had in New York all around." u'This review is based on attending a Yelp event at Ted\'s Montana Grill where we got the opportunity to sample a selection of their food and drinks. \xa0Bison has long been something I wanted to try and although it is a red meat very similar to beef there is a subtle flavour difference (probably due to the reduced fat content of bison meat). \xa0Let me tell you "Ted\'s filet" did not disappoint! \xa0The bison sample was delicious and perfectly cooked for my taste. \xa0To me the filet was the highlight but we also sampled: * "St Phillips Island Crab Cakes with avocado" (generous amounts of crab)* "Southwest corn" (although not something I would normally have it was very good and spicy without being over the top)* "Bar None Sliders" (beef and bison burger in a "biscuit" bun - we ended up in a long semantic debate about scone vs biscuit vs cookie but as the weird foreigner I really had no chance ;) ) \xa0The sliders were excellent although the "salt and pepper onion rings" were not really my thing as I\'m not a huge fan of deep fried crumbed stuff* "Cedar Plank Salmon" \xa0Noticeable cedar flavour which worked very well with the salmon* Brownies (which I generously helped others finish). \xa0Had it not been for the bison filet this may have been my favourite...They also had red and white sangria plus wines and fresh squeezed lemonade. \xa0I drank the "Bison Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon" which paired well with the bison in more than just name.All in all a very enjoyable evening with excellent food and extremely friendly staff. \xa0Granted it was an organised event but I would definitely return for a pre-show meal especially the three course "Theatre Menu" which seems a reasonable price for Manhattan.' u"Food quality - poorCrapcake - not tasty and dry The salad was old we had to give it back. You know how the salad turns brown after a while. That's exactly what we got. The no. 11 burger with a bison patty - what should I say... It was simple a bad burger. The bison paddy tasteless i ordered medium - got it done!No a tasty burger.The waiter was nice. She was very kind and knowledgeable" u"It's not just a steak house people! The sangria was to die for! (Or maybe I was too many in to tell the difference but same thing right?) The appetizers are also pretty great. Specifically the Crab Cakes Trout Dip Southwest Corn and Fresh-Cut Fries mmm. I also really enjoyed the Ted's Filet. Unfortunately the sliders and the salmon were overcooked at our table. (Some other tables in our large event party really enjoyed the sliders and salmon!) By the time we got to dessert half our table was settling into food coma and crawling their way out the door. But I'm glad we stayed for the brownies and got cookies to go!PS. I came for a catered sit-down Yelp event." u'Ted\'s was suggested by a friend for a pre-theater meal. \xa0She had described it as casual but I\'m not sure that\'s exactly right. \xa0Maybe it is just an odd blend of casual and formal. \xa0The interior is dimly lit with dark woods and there is a nice bar.Our server was very kind and let us order the chips and onion dip that was only on the lunch menu. \xa0The chips and dip were very tasty. \xa0I ordered a Buffalo 41 cocktail. \xa0It was fine but I almost thought they brought the wrong drink initially. \xa0The berries slightly overwhelmed the drink especially considering they were the last thing listed on the "recipe."I got the Balsamic Blue Steak Salad with the BLT Ranch dressing. \xa0It was a big salad to be sure but I found it pretty boring. \xa0There seemed to have been large bits of cabbage in the mixed greens because I kept biting into slightly bitter crunchy bits. \xa0The steak was tough to cut on the salad and ultimately I just ate it separately. \xa0The dressing was very good. \xa0For a $20 salad I kinda expected more.' u"A spacious beautiful restaurant with nice music playing over the speakers. Our dishes--crabcake salad bison swordfish and cheesecake--were all excellent. Prices are typical for nice Midtown places. Excellent waitress and maitre d'. Bison is both sweeter and leaner than steak--I wish my supermarket carried it!" u"Food: good to very good to ideal depending on how high marks you can give what is to me an awesome a bit classy burger joint. The first time I went to Ted's \xa0was about six years ago. Cap Grill and Ruth's are right next door and while I offered them my client said let's go to teds. It's delicious and half the price. I've been back \xa0a dozen times since. You're choices are buffalo or traditional burger or chicken. All are great. All are elk prepared. All are filling and probably not on weight watchers. Try the Cadillac. Ridiculous.Service: every single time it has been Olin point. Polite attentive knowledgable clean. Unlikely you'll get any complaints here.Atmosphere: pretty typical. Exposed wood busy a bit noisy but not too bad I guess clean open.Misc: they have a dry soap in the bathroom. It's weird. I kind of hate it but I actually love it. If that makes sense. I'll be back. Hope you try it."]
172.Brazil Brazil,[u"If you like brazilian food this is the best place in the city! I'm brazilian so I love all the plates there!" u'Terrible terrible terrible...1 hour wait for drinks after complaining they came out at the same time as dinner...no serious attempt to rectify...total tourist trap!' u'If you want to try authentic amazing and delicious Brazilian food; definitely try this place. The service was wonderful. Inside they have live music in Portuguese. You basically feel like you are in Rio de Janiero. I recommend!!' u'Fantastic food!! We stumbled upon this place off times square just looking for a place without a wait. We had an 8 o clock show and had already been to two places closer to times square with a 30-40 minute wait and it was already 6:45. This place was busy but sat us IMMEDIATELY it was spacious and had a very nice atmosphere which is half of the experience in NYC. Great service and we made it on time for our show with time to spare.I had the skirt steak which was cooked in a delicious marinade a side of mashed potatoes and the fried yucca added a perfect variety of texture and taste was with the steak.I bet that everything on this menu would be great from the 3 things me and my wife and brother ordered. Fantastic steak and a great dining experience!! I highly recommend this place if you are close to times square.' u'Fantastic restaurant with great service! Shrimp in coconut with fresh veggies did not disappoint in presentation or flavor!' u'Well I am Brazilian and in my opinion the food is good I think a little taste to americans less coconut milk as usual in bobo de camarao and moqueca de peixe. But was really good. The quindin was delicious! Try the Brazilian martini.' u'Awesome Food Great service what a culinary treat! my first time trying Brazilian Food..' u'Me and the Mrs. decided to check out this place on a Friday evening. There was no wait at 7:15 pm and we instantly got outside seating at this restaurant. One of the driving factors was their $6 happy hour drinks which included Caipirinha! After being seated we were told that drinks ordered at the table are full price but at the bar they are for $6. 1 star goes away for that. Never have I heard such a ridiculous thing!Anyways we moved on and still ordered our drinks. I had a Brazilian beer which was okay.We ordered an appetizer.. Camar\xe3o Alho e Ol\xe9o.. the description looked amazing.. Saut\xe9ed shrimps with garlic in a white wine lemon sauce... the dish seriously lacked garlic and if you don\'t like seafood with a lot of "fishy" taste do not get this! It was not worth the $16 price tag at all.For main course we ordered the Moqueca de Peixe.. while this certainly overpriced at $25 the dish lives up to its description.. White fish saut\xe9ed peppers onions tomatoes fish broth coconut milk and palm oil finished cilantro served over pir\xe3o rice beans.. we shared this dish and it\'s a decent portion. This dish in itself receives 2 stars and was indeed the star and savior of our evening!As for the service no complaints here. Friendly staff warm and welcoming.We were not too happy about the 15% gratuity that they added on a party of 2... but that\'s fine.. sometimes it works in your favor.. we were going to go for 18% ;-)' u'This place is near the theater and their Prix Fixe menu was one of the main reasons we chose this place. However it was disappointing to discover some of the items on the online menu were not available on the actual menu at the restaurant. The food itself was not memorable not bad but nothing stood out. The online prix fixe price is also outdated. However the service was good and the restaurant itself has a nice casual atmosphere.' u'My appointment failed to show and i was in the area and stopped for lunch. I got the fixed price meal-the garden salad pasta primavera and the beef burguionone. Coconut flan for dessert with coffee.An excellent meal. Would recommend and return' u'The food is immaculate. My favorite dish is the coconut shrimp. My friends and I absolutely adore the house sangria. A bit of advice- Please make sure that the bread served is soft and not hard as if it were sitting out since perhaps the night before. Also I find it very compulsive and pushy how the waiters and bus boys are always reaching to take away the plates. It feels rushed! Sometimes guests just want to enjoy each other and or sit in solice for a few minutes after a good meal. Although I love going to this restaurant all of the rushing makes me want to explore other options at this point.' u'Went on A Friday night. Nice atmosphere in the back. You can still hear the live musician but it does not over power you like upfront. Good background music and you can still have a nice dinner conversation. I had the mixed grill with Pork Steak and Chicken. Also had the Calamari as the appetizer. Good big portion sizes. I was already full off that.' u"Wow had an amazing dinner here! My husband is from southern Brazil so when he misses his mom's cooking we like to come here. \xa0Our second time here and food was just as good as before. \xa0Waiter was awesome always showed up when we needed something. \xa0I got the chicken with hearts of palm was awesome. \xa0My husband got the chicken stroganoff. \xa0He licked his plate clean. \xa0We were stuffed couldn't fit another bite :( but Previously had their mousse and they don't disappoint! \xa0you have to try it!" u'I stopped by during the week since I had purchased a groupon deal.Tried to make reservations but no one answered the phone either way didn\'t look like we needed it since when we arrived we were seated right away. Walking in bar area was packed but the side by the dinning room was good.Once seated we decide to go with the Sauvignon Blanc for our wine choice  nice wine good taste. On the appetizer our deal allowed for one we got the Tapas Appetizers this was Fried Chicken it was good Shrimp in garlic & oil this was pretty bland & The Chicken Pastry  good nice taste but the chicken was a bit dry. This dish sounded good when we picked it didn\'t realize it was so small whoa good thing we also got the Linguica Frita com Mandioca this is Crispy yucca fries and brazilian sausage served with malagueta mayo this dish saved the appetizers good yuca fries nice tasting mayo the Brazilian sausage wasn\'t bad but a bit over cooked.Main meal I decide to go with the Churrasco Misto Mainly because it was mixed meats  this had beef chicken and sausage  good steak well cooked juice  delicious sausage chicken was ok again kinda dry this came with white rice & beans it was good. My friend \xa0had the Paella plenty of seafood & rice here good size dish. We had finished our wine & decide to try some Brazilian Beer we had the Palma Louca  nice really liked this beer great taste.Dessert time came we tried the Cheese Cake  really good & The Brazilian Flan this was ok didn\'t really taste anything different guess I expected something better. Nice place good atmosphere  our waiter was pretty nice & attentive prices aside from having the deal are moderate. When it came time to pay we know that u tip on the value of the whole meal of course we were surprised to see a "suggested tip amount" written down on the bill this was I don\'t know kinda uncomfortable only because the "suggested tip" was more than it should be I mean listen we had a good meal & tipped accordingly they should not make suggestions way to forward tipping is earned due to good service. Aside from this little mishap We enjoyed our meal.' u"Excellent \xa0authentic \xa0Brazilian \xa0restaurant \xa0just blocks \xa0from time square. If I didn't \xa0know better \xa0just sitting \xa0on the patio of the restaurant \xa0you'd \xa0think you where in Brazil. \xa0All the staff where from Brazil \xa0and spoke with thick  beautiful \xa0accents. The service \xa0was great everyone was very friendly. \xa0I ordered \xa0the chicken \xa0Coco cabana. \xa0Which was basically \xa0chicken \xa0and mashed \xa0potatoes \xa0with a mushroom \xa0gravy. \xa0It came with black beans and rice. I also tried the fried banana . Everything \xa0was wonderful." u'The front guy \xa0told us you can sahre a plate (so I assumed the portion was good to share). The waitress was nice. Old bread. The beer and red sangria were good. Babao de camaron with only 5 shrimps in a warm-not hot- yucca sauce with a hint of coconut but bland and a small side of rice and beans. We left hungry and a bill not worthy the amout of money we paid for the flavor and portion. Instead go to Sangria 46....way much better!' u"Came in at a very odd hour so at 2:30PM where most restaurants in the area would close for lunch and reopen for dinner. Settled for here when our first choice was closed. I've never had Brazilian food before and after this I'm not quite sure if it's authentic.. Though now that I think of it Brazil is like a fusion of Spanish French and Portugal so it's EuroFusion. Anyway since it's pretty late in lunch hour there wasn't that many people in the restaurant so it was a bit quiet. (There was like about 5 other tables which isn't bad.) Because we came at an odd time there wasn't anyone to seat us at first and shortly after someone came and showed us to a table next to the Christmas tree. So I assume all the waiters speak English French Spanish and Portuguese which was cool. Our waiter seemed slow but friendly. But let's get on with the food.Apps: Ceviche de Camar\xe3o and Salgadinhos (Beef turnover chicken pastry cod fish croquette and cheese turnover). I never had Ceviche before it was good. Of course it's acidic but it wasn't overpowering. The Salgadinhos were interesting it was four deep fried food in different shapes. Anything deep fried tastes good. The turnovers look like empanadas. Out of the the four I liked the cod fish croquette. The Chicken pastry had like a dough layer that was actually heavy and made it chewy. Entree: Lobster Ravioli Picanha na Chapa (Traditional Brazilian Meat on a sizzling Platter) and Bobo de Camar\xe3o (Shrimp with coconut milk and other vegs). I had the meat first and it was good medium. It's thin and tender. Wasn't too chewy. I think it had strong taste of pepper. The Lobster Ravioli tasted good but the essence of lobster wasn't really there. The sauce was very good though. The shrimp tasted good I love coconut milk so it was smooth and light. All pretty average.Dessert: Brazilian Flan and Quindin (Coconut and egg custard). I made a point to my friend and her mom that they sound the same on paper (cause they ordered dessert while I was in the bathroom). The Brazilian Flan looked and tasted like regular flan. So it's wasn't anything too special. The Quindin was much heavier and thick. It tasted good. There was an ingredient in there that I couldn't put my finger on. Because it's very heavy I couldn't have too much of it.Overall it was pretty average. Not exactly how I pictured. I guess nothing really stood out to me. The wait staff is a bit slow but I'm not sure if it's because it wasn't a lunch rush (though in general that shouldn't matter). I wouldn't come back or really recommend it to anyone. Gotta look for another Brazilian place tor try." u'Service was superb. Food was excellent. Vibe was exquisite. Definitely would recommend Brazil Brazil in the future to others.' u'Food is delicious staff is wonderful! Definitely a place to go to for a great meal! I got the Camarao no coco and my boyfriend got the Frango com Palmito. Both were divine! Filling without being heavy' u'It is not guaranteed that when you try an ethnic food restaurant that you will like it specially because the spices seasoning textures might be totally different from what you are used to. Figure trying to compare Tony Roma\'s to an Ethiopian restaurant. Thus take this review with a grain of salt. I was born in Brazil grew up with all the flavors and spices typical of Brazilian dishes thus I will rate Brazilian restaurants under a local "eye".That is why I gave Brazil Brazil a 5 star rating. The food was very close to what I had in Brazil for many years. In summary it was very good brought back good memories!We had the Moqueca de Peixe Bob\xf3 de Camar\xe3o and Picanha (fish stew shrimp in a creamy sauce and steak). Highly recommended.We also had appetizers (fried calamari and Brazilian sausage) and Brigadeiro (chocolate balls) and Pudim de Leite (flan) for desert. Also all were very good.Service was very friendly and attentive I was pleased.A band was playing Brazilian music very nice.In conclusion: if you are ready to taste interesting flavors and new twists to traditional recipes then by all means try Brazil Brazil... you will like it.Recommended!']
85.Wrapido,[u"My friend and I were searching for some late-night grub on Sunday that was cheap and delicious. Wrapido came to our rescue!Hands-down some of the best falafel that I've ever had let alone in New York. Each piece was perfectly crispy on the outside while remaining soft and crumbly on the inside (you know that you're a foodie when you have a phobia of chewy falafel).I ordered the falafel salad because I was not hungry enough to eat an entire serving of rice and bread. For those who are hungrier though the platter gives you couscous and a side order of pita bread. I did not see the platter option on the menu but I checked with my friend that ordered it and the price was the same as the salad.For anyone reading this review online make sure you check in with the Yelp app on your phone for 10% off your order!" u"This review is for the delivery part only. I lost my appetite after this incident.The rudest delivery driver I have EVER encountered. Unprofessional doesn't even describe this man and he should be fired. He had to wait 2 minutes prior me to coming up to the front of the office to collect my order and that was his issue. I work in healthcare and was quickly finishing up with a patient as he called me THREE TIMES in those 2 minutes and then proceeded to get loud and nasty. Never ordering delivery from here again though I'm sure the food itself is great." u"Amazing middle eastern food! And this is coming from a middle eastern :) Great falafel shawarma and eggplants - you can't go wrong with anything on their menu and they make their own wrap bread and falafel on the spot it's wonderfully fresh and delicious!It was a little awkward getting my free baklava after posting this review but totally worth it!" u'Excellent food! Was craving a good Swarma and I found it here. Highly recommend for a quick bite.' u'Fast Mediterranean- warm pita filled with good tasting falafel and salad. Choice of dressings and four added fillings.Quick bite to eat- nothing fancy but decent food.' u"Very fresh good prices and plenty of food. Wheat and white pita and wrap options and your choice of 4 toppings on whatever you order. Very tasty meat and veggies and quick service. They have a 'quick order' board for those who don't want to peruse all the options available but there should be something here for almost anyone. Drinks by the bottle can and fountain are available and there is quite a bit of seating. Orders are prepared quickly." u'***fast service healthy great options***Highly recommend coming here if you want something quick and easy. Service is great. Definitely check in for free goodies!!!!' u'Yummy schwarma if you want something quick and easy \xa0(and not to expensive). Good place to sit down during the food festival' u'The falafel pita and chips were both excellent. Restaurant is also very clean and the staff is very friendly!' u'Came here with my whole big family (8 people). Fast nice and very accommodating. Among us we got falafel pita shawarma pita eggplant wrap and schnitzel. All delicious! Highly recommend this place.' u"I don't live in New York and pulled up Yelp to find something quick to eat nearby my hotel. \xa0I went to Wrapido and was not disappointed.The food was really good and filling. \xa0Service was fast. \xa0I ate my meal there and took one order to go and he waited to cook the meat on my to-go order to coincide with when I was finishing up my meal which I really appreciated.If there was a Wrapido close to me I would definitely go all the time." u'Their lunch is amazing! I order the grilled chicken platter two days in a row with traditional couscous and OMG yummmmm! The delivery was very fast and the delivery guy was pleasant too :) overall great great!!!' u'All you see $16 tax in!The Eggplant Plant salad was packed and heavy. I didn\'t get any dressing and it was good and moist. Light on the eggplant though and I\'m happy with the salad. The "chips" are called Lavash tasty with a bit of heat; made from Pita Bread. The drink was their homemade Mint Ginger Lemonade really good.' u'Awesome customer service and great falafel !!I had 5.95 falafel pita. They have full size pita bread with 5 falafel inside with great mix of salad n dressing.' u'Awesome healthy options for a very affordable price. And lots of seating..The space is clean welcoming and modern.' u"I've been here on 2 occasions ordered the Shawarma Wraps 2 times and plan on ordering it again on the next visit. When I like something I order it again and again and the Shawarma at Wrapido is one of them - the best wraps in Manhattan. Also clean seating area and friendly staff!" u'Have it your way style Mediterranean food has been winning me over lately. \xa0Here you can score a full on platter or opt for your choice of protein in a pita wrap or salad. \xa0There are a slew of toppings to choose from but they cap you depending on what you order and charge extra for feta avocado egg and cheddar toppings (lamesies). \xa0Chicken shawarma was solid but their Tzatziki could use a little more oomph.' u'Good tasty falafel sandwiches and eggplant sandwiches. They have a lot of good tasty add ons to your sandwiches and the prices are reasonable for the area. \xa0I usually get 2 falafel sandwiches which comes out to like $11-12 not bad. Most of their food is under $10!I usually order over the phone and then come pick it up. Good food seems healthy with decent prices. I recommend as a lunch option for those in the area or those who work around the area.' u"We ordered Wrapido on Seamless and probably won't again. \xa0They ignored my instructions mixed up which ingredients to put in the wraps and the wraps fell apart after just one bite.We ordered grilled chicken wraps. \xa0I ordered pickles with mine and requested them on the side and instead did not receive any pickles (none in the sandwich or on the side). \xa0My colleague ordered his dressing on the side and the same thing happened; he did not receive any dressing period.Additionally the tortilla wraps were too thin and delicate. \xa0After opening the paper wrapping the tortilla stuck to the paper and completely ripped forcing me to eat my meal with a fork and knife. \xa0My colleague's did not rip upon opening however within a bite his too had fallen apart." u'The wrap was a little small for the cost but it was pretty good. I got the shawarma chicken wrap and enjoyed it. My friend got the platter and that was a lot more food.']
195.Manting,[u"I love this place! I've been here to pick up lunch a few times and I've also been here for dinner a couple of times. Their lunch is a great deal because you get 3 different items plus a choice of white or brown rice (which they do not charge extra for!) plus a soup for $10. For me it's usually enough to last me 2 days. Don't go by their takeout menu because they generally don't have all of the same choices that they have listed on their menu but everything that I've had there there has been very good.When I come here for dinner I get the malatang which is delicious! It's basically hotpot (but not the type where you cook everything yourself) you can choose the spice level that you want and the meat/vegetables that you want. You can also request additional toppings to your liking. It comes with noodles in it mushroom tofu so though they call it a stew it's more like a big hearty soup. Great for when you're sick and craving something spicy." u"Came to have some dinner before attending a Broadway musical about a week ago. I was on the fence about going here since I am not too big on spicy spicy food (I can handle a bit/hint of spice). One of my friends is also not good with spice. So I guess we went out of our comfort zones. It was mild spicy I can't say I didn't really enjoy it. Not bad :) We were seated right away with these square wooden seats (no back cushion) and you can hang your sweaters/coats up on the hooks. The vegetables are $9.80 per pound and meats are $11.80/lb. We got 1.23 pounds of vegetables and 1.47 protein. We each got a bowl of rice. My friend also wanted this small can of Chinese tea that was $2.50. The total (including tax) for the three of us came out to be under $37 so that was good. We were all full.Besides them giving us the wrong check and our bill being like almost 30% more expensive it was a pretty okay experience. I heard their lunch deal is good though." u"3.4 starts! Why ? First I think the Mala Xiang Guo is an amazing spicy soup . I love this dish also Good the Dry hot pot that goes well with rice. Little expensive but you are in time square what do you expect and everything around there is in fact very expensive. I sometimes get my lunch special \xa0there for only $10 ... THEY Don't \xa0TAKE CREDIT CARDS FOR $10 \xa0their minimum is $30 per Card Oh well ! I assume People there get pay cash only. Must be the only reason for them to make the customer pay Cash only specially \xa0their special Lunches! ... However I like the place . Although sometimes they have a lot people working behind the counter which must of the TIME THEY \xa0DONT EXPLAIN THE MENU WELL. I've seen people leaving because \xa0they don't understand what the heck are they explaining. I think the staff there should be more friendly and smile and get to learn the MENU MORE !" u'This place is amazing. Dry hot pot ingredients are fresh and their sauce is great as well. No more going to Flushing for dry hot pot!' u"Came to this cute little Szechuan place to heat things up on a Friday night before going to see Deadpool. Grand total with tip was around $70 split among three people. My three-star breakdown:Space - Simple narrow layout. When you walk in the door seating is to your left service area to your right and bathroom directly in the back. Tables comfortably sit four people. I can't say too much about the comfort level of the benches and stools though. I think my behind fell asleep halfway through our 60-minute meal. Service - Could be better. My main complaint would be on the slow tea refills (I'm new to spicy).Tea - \xa0When you sit down the server pours you a free cup of tea (the kind you get at dim sum places). Refills are free too. Sweet and Sour Pork - I always love this dish wherever I go. Pineapples were fresh and gave the dish the perfect touch of sweetness.Shrimp Fried Rice - Fresh peeled shrimp! Often times shrimp dishes disappoint me because the restaurant uses shrimp that tastes like plastic. Not here! We finished this dish in no time.Dry Hot Pot - At the veggie section we went with the (1) wood ear (2) shimeji mushroom (3) lotus root (4) bean sprouts and (5) seaweed. At the protein section we went with the (1) beef (2) shrimp (3) fish tofu and (4) pork. Medium spice level w/ glass noodles. My friends loved it but I'm still getting accustomed to spicy. Please improve on the service." u"It's not a big place and it's very crowded during lunchtime. It has both Americanized Chinese food and authentic Chinese spicy dry pot in the back. Save the trip to downtown Chinatown. You choose what ingredients to put in the pot. One guest needs to order at least 1lb which is around $10 for veggies and $12 for protein. 1lb is not much actually. It also comes with rice and complimentary green bean soup \u7eff\u8c46\u6c64 or \u9178\u6885\u6c64 plum soup. Perfect for summer." u"Had their takeout and their noodle soups. Only lunch special is their three choices and a soup. Wasn't too fond of their lunch special in the first few months they had opened. Too greasy and watery for my liking. I gave it another try with their noodle soups. The bill was $13 for a noodle soup that was the size of what I would normally get in flushing for about $7-8. I thought it was supposed to be $11ish because the seafood noodle soup on their signage said $11 before tax but the cashier told me it was wrong and that it was the same as the other bowls like beef noodle soup. This to me is super expensive for lackadaisical thinner than udon noodles.The broth tasted like it was filled with msg. There was a lot of octopus but only really one of each other seafood like one fillet one fishball maybe three veggies.... After this I most likely would not go again since I've tried two of their main dishes there...besides the pick your produce and they cook it for u food. Service is fast if u don't order the three choice one soup line." u"We stumbled upon this place walking around NYC. The restaurant is very clean and it was a friendly atmosphere.Delicious food and good service. We ordered dumplings chow mein fried rice beef & broccoli and general tso's chicken.Would highly recommend this place." u'This is a decent place for traditional Szechuan food especially if you are a fan of spicy pot. Indeed a handful of selections were offered with protein selection (chicken fish lamb pork beef fish tofu) and veggie selection (different mushrooms cabbage). spiciness also ranges from no spice to extra extra hot. our group only went for small spicy and were already got wowed so make sure you are not making over-estimation.Lunch time could get really crowded and five minute does make a difference. We came in around 1145 and it was still half empty; however by the time we got our food (20 min later) people started to line up and wait for empty table.Service kind of sucks as they tend to ignore what you said after you ordered. Nevertheless definitely one of the best spicy pot place in this area.' u'As a big fan of hot pot I love dry pot almost as much. This place is very authentic and makes great tasting and actually spicy dry pot. You can pick out each vegetable and meat you want they weigh it and fry it up to your level of spice. I havent tried their other dishes so I cant speak about those but you should really come here for the dry pot. Warning to vegetarians!! If you want them to make it without meat you have to be very specific about that. Maybe say it multiple times to multiple people. Like any very authentic chinese place they dont really understand what it means to be vegetarian.' u"Finally a legitimate ma la tang/Sichuan Chinese restaurant in MIDTOWN of all places! \xa0The food gods have been listening!Ma la tang is essentially a spicy chinese stew/hot pot. \xa0At Manting they let you choose your own level of spice but beware - it's still spicy. \xa0I got the beef tripe ma la tang (hot pot) for $12.95 - it's definitely more expensive than the restaurants that serve this type of food in Flushing Queens but you don't have to travel all the way out there on the 7 to get it AND you can get it during your work lunch! \xa0The beef tripe was fresh but there wasn't enough of it. \xa0There was a large variety of vegetables in the hot pot as well as cellophane noodles which is traditional. \xa0The soup base was a bit on the salty side but was very very flavorful.There are also options for noodle soups which I will try next time.Manting also offers traditional dry hot pot - your choice of various vegetables and meats all stirfried in a spicy sauce - minimum is 2 lbs or else you are charged an extra $5. \xa0It's $2.45 per 1/4 lb for veggies and $2.99 per 1/4 lb for meats and seafood. \xa0Again more expensive than Flushing but you don't have to commute an hour to get it. \xa0This is also on my to-try list.For those in a rush Manting has a hot buffet table for takeout as well. \xa0It's something like $9.95 for 3 kinds of dishes and rice + soup - not bad I'd say.Overall Manting offers the Midtown lunch crew something different for lunch and it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood." u"Flushing's new world mall quality food found conveniently in Manhattan. No longer does one need to traverse the long dreaded 7 train to flushing for some good spicy dry pot. \xa0Skeptical at first me and my fianc\xe9 carried doubts of the quality of their food and their advertised level of spice and flavor. \xa0Those concerns were gone with the first bite of their spicy dry pot. \xa0You have levels varying from none to a lot of heat that can be selected. A note if you intend to order spicy dry pot you need to approach the food counter and select your veggies and meats. \xa0Then you provide to them with your table and in a few short minutes they'll bring the bowl to you. \xa0The other items on their menu that is not related to spicy dry pot are all ordered at your table. \xa0Items such as their fried rice or noodle soups. \xa0This part was a bit confusing as no instruction was given and a few minutes were wasted just waiting for some one to be flagged down to clarify. \xa0Over all it's a good place to eat if you're in the mood for something spicy plus it saves so much on the commuting time to Flushing just to satisfy your craving." u"$20 dollars minimum for credit card which is ridiculous because most of their items on the menus is below $20! I have been there before before they impose this non-sense rule. The cashier didn't provide any resolutions and put up an attitude not to serve me at all. They don't have an ATM machine on site. Their rule attitude made me walk out..." u'I decided to try this place out after a Chinese coworker let me in on this place.In the front: steaming platters of your standard Chinese food. I avoided this like a venereal disease. I want the real stuff.Instead I ventured toward the back where platters of raw meat and vegetables glimmered enticingly at me. The menu is on a wall a mishmash of misspelled words (for example "Lamp hotpot" instead of "Lamb hotpot") with prices but no descriptions. Confused people darted here and there looking baffled at how to order as some more adept native Chinese speakers stepped forward and bravely faced the lady behind the cash register."Lamp hotpot please!" I say proudly. She gives me a quizzical look. I repeat my order in both Chinese and English and she nods. I pay ($13). A few minutes later I\'m handed a steaming cauldron of spice meat and vegetables. I sit down and taste it. It\'s spicy as hell (even though I asked for the mild spicy level). The meat is sliced paper thin and boiled in the soup absorbing the piquant spiciness. The vegetables also soak up the beautiful broth. At the bottom there is a surprise of glass noodles sliced seaweed and bean shoots. Unfortunately there are no true soup spoons to ladle the broth into my eager gaping mouth.Thirty minutes later with a pile of used napkins next to me (both to clean up all the splattering hot oil as well as to blow my nose with) I stand up slightly dizzy from the spice. "This is a truly authentic dish in Sichuan China" I\'m told by my dining companion. It certainly tasted that way.I\'ll definitely be back for more punishment.' u"Authentic Sichuan fast food. \xa0A bit pricey for what it is and has the ambiance of a cafeteria/food court (fluorescent lights generic radio music in the background). \xa0But hits the spot when I have a craving for Sichuan and don't want to venture out to Flushing. \xa0Which is like everyday more or less. \xa0In particular this is the only place I know of in Manhattan that serves spicy wok (\u9ebb\u8fa3\u9999\u9505) where you can pick your own ingredients by weight.One pound minimum with $5 surcharge. \xa0At least two pounds = no additional charge.I ordered medium spicy but turned out a bit mild (compared to typical Sichuan around the city). \xa0Could just be a one-off thing?Service is pretty good for what it is. \xa0Waiters try to be helpful. \xa0Zero wait on a weeknight." u'Food was great but overpriced ($33.28 for two of us). I had Mala Xiang Guo with a friend and we were really full! There are many items to choose from for your Mala Xiang Guo: beef lamb beef tripe fish fillet lotus roots seaweed wood ear and mushrooms. We had mild spicy and it\'s about right. Chinese mild spicy is very spicy for most people for those who have a low tolerance of spiciness I would suggest to get the non spicy option.The restaurant is a little confusing because it is divided into two sections. On the side that near the door you have the standard lunch bar (choose 3 sides with rice) and on the far side you have the authentic Sichuan food. There are two different cash registers and two group of servers. I\'ve only been to the "authentic Chinese" side so I cannot speak for the other. Manting definitely worth checking out not only as a good lunch spot but also if you are adventurous enough to try regional Chinese cuisine. I\'ll have Ma La Tang there next time.' u"Dry pot's the new hotness apparently so let me break down how it works at least at Manting. An employee fills up two bowls with raw food for you - one bowl is filled with non-proteins (cabbage broccoli noodles etc.) the other with proteins (shrimp beef tripe tofu cake etc.). You tell them how spicy you want it they cook it all in a hot pot-style broth then they pour the whole thing into a giant bowl for communal consumption. You get charged by the weight (different prices for the different bowls).You can tell the employees how many people are in your group and let them use their best judgement on how much food to put in. It's hard to know exactly how many mushrooms is good for three people but they have a good idea about it all. The price came out to about $20 for each of us which is comparable to regular hot pot prices.For those accustomed to hot pot this is basically that streamlined. You have the peppery heat and flavor from the red chilis working its way into all the ingredients sans the splattering of broth everywhere. You'll probably still smell a little. The food is good - there's no chance of you leaving something to drown in the pot for a good hour so nothing is overcooked.But man the service really brought me down on this place. I get it Asian restaurants have crap service. Used to it and I usually factor that in. But Manting is just a block from Times Square yet they can't even handle splitting a credit card bill? I needed $50 on my card for work reasons and the rest on another card and they just couldn't do it even with the manager involved. I thought this was 2015 where I can buy stuff from vending machines with credit card.We ended up paying with card and gave them enough cash to cover the difference but they still messed that up taking all the cash and putting the difference on the card. Dry pot is an experience worth trying but maybe try someplace else." u"I had the lunch special it was okay.. Definitely not bad but didn't blow my mind to smithereens either. The place was clean (yay) and the employees were very friendly." u"Great spicy stir fry around the area we made here for a quick dinner stop it's a pick-your-ingredient type of place where they toss everything together I had it mild spicy it was pretty good!" u'Overpriced food for those who do not want to travel to Chinatown or flushing. Nothing special just the usual spicy northern Chinese food. I paid 19$ for decent portion and no left overs.']
54.Dafni Greek Taverna,[u"This place is awesome. The menu is priced good and the food is amazing. We got the pikilia dinner (sampler of lamb beef and pork) and the grilled shrimp. Both were amazing. If I go back I will definitely order the full plate of lamb because it was the best I've had so far. If your a Greek mythology lover you'll enjoy all the stories about Dafni who turned into a tree to escape her lover. Anyway I think the food was cooked by the Greek god of deliciousness." u'I love it when people get "food envious" when I order the best-looking meal. You know what I mean - that moment when the waiter brings in your table\'s food and everyone in your party is checking out each other\'s meals and then you realize...YOU HAVE THE BEST MEAL. That happened to me when my friends and I were eating at Dafni\'s and I ordered the gyro platter. It comes with a VERY generous portion of perfectly seasoned gyro meat and a side of rice and tzatziki that compliments the main dish well. I could feel everyone\'s eyes on my food and I loved it! I was a winner that night and you can be one too...as long as you order that gyro platter! Yum!' u"So so good. You can get Greek food at many places throughout NYC but it's not always memorable. I don't know Dafni but she doesn't disappoint. I tried the salad that starts with an H and it was so delish. Try the 3 meze platter to start with the eggplant. The chicken kebab \xa0= thumbs up too. For ordering in or dining out this may be my new spot. Check it out!" u'My boyfriend and I had our VERY FIRST DATE almost 3 years ago at Dafini. This past Valentine\'s Day we saw a show on Broadway and went for an early dinner after (Dafni is conveniently walking distance from the show which was at the new Amsterdam theatre). I remember how much I enjoyed the food on our very first date here so I was looking forward to a good Greek meal and spending our Valentine\'s Day at the restaurant we had our first date at call me a mush but it\'s special to me!We walked in around 5 on a Saturday there were 2 other couples eating. The hostess/waitress greeted us and asked if we had a reservation (no we did not). She responded with "we are going to be very busy in a while but if you want to eat quick our food comes out fast mumble mumble an hour mumble I can seat you". \xa0My boyfriend graciously apologized for not making reservations and we were seated promptly. We ordered spanakopita for an appetizer (mediocre)... The spinach was dry inside. I ordered keftedes which is a pasta with a delicious stew and meatballs on top my boyfriend ordered the moussaka. Both came out very fast they prepared the dishes very poorly. I had minimal sauce on the pasta (which I later asked for more of). Both dishes were good but unfortunately were not as good as the first time we came. For dessert we had baklava- absolutely scrumptious. Probably the best baklava I\'ve had. Overall the food is good here don\'t get me wrong. Yes it was our fault we did not make a reservation but I would rather have been turned away then be rushed through a meal.' u'Disappointing! I was expecting better foods with the amazing reviews. My chicken were too dry and the rest of my foods were tasteless.' u"Nice Theater District find. Tasty food and generous portions - I had a Greek salad with salmon and also tried lamb gyro with lemon potatoes and chicken with fries. The pita and tzaziki is great too. Our service wasn't great but the food was delicious so I would come back. It's easy to get a reservation." u'Went here prior to the theater and it was pretty good. \xa0Started with the spanakopita and it was better than many I had. \xa0For dinner had the gyro plate and the meat was cooked nice and tasty. \xa0The pita bread was very good. \xa0The portions were quite large-the spanakopita appetizer was enough for 2 people easy or combined with another appetizer would make a good meal. \xa0The gyro platter had a lot of meat and I had the roasted potatoes which were good but the spanakopita filled me up. \xa0I had to try the galaktoboureko which I had enjoyed in Greece and it was quite good. \xa0 My friend had the roasted vegetables and enjoyed them. \xa0Service was pretty good although the waitress did not seem to fully understand the questions asked though she was very nice. \xa0It is convenient to the theaters and food is pretty good.' u"We shared the Pikilia a charcoal grilled combination platter ($17.95) and a side order of the Greek fries ($5.00). The platter came with gyro (sliced lamb) bifteki (ground beef) \xa0souvlaki (marinated chicken cubes) and sides - rice (or potato) tzatziki and cucumber relish. I enjoyed the gyro as it wasn't as gamey as most lamb dishes I've had before. The popular Greek fries was a bit disappointing. Perhaps I prefer regular salted french fries (that crispy crunchy deep fried exterior) as the Greek fries were more like sliced baked potatoes topped with oregano and cheese.Bonus: Complimentary fresh warm pita bread! I only wish they had some hummus!Tip for 2: I would recommend to order an entree and a side to share together as the portions are quite large." u"Fresh pitas and tasty tzakziki! But what surprised me the most was the grilled octopus appetizer. It was so tender and moist definitely exceeded my expectations. Their grilled shrimp is also very good but I can't seem to find it on seamless anymore. Even their house salad with feta seems to taste better than those typical Greek salads. Awesome Greek restaurant with relatively inexpensive dishes for midtown." u"As authentic as it gets for greek food and drinks. We were visiting from Texas and went to this place a few times. Nice people with great food. I recommend the pikilia grill plate.. yum yum.Potatos and fish are real good as well.Don't miss the place if you are in the area." u"Finally a decent restaurant in tourist hell. This place was so good! Nice atmosphere. \xa0Reservations are definitely recommended. Ordered the grilled octopus - this is a must for me anytime I eat in a Greek restaurant. Their grilled octopus did not disappoint.Ordered the loukaniko (grilled sausage with leeks) absolutely amazing. The leeks were so good too!!We ordered the Greek salad. It's standard but that doesnt make it boring. The feta tasted very fresh and the dressing they gave us was so unique tasting. Not what you'd expect on a Greek salad. Loved it.Lastly we ordered the plaki (baked filet of striped bass with tomato sauce onions garlic and white wine). This dish was mind blowing. The sauce was superb. The fish was excellent. I will definitely be back to this place. What a fantastic find!" u"Came here Valentine's Day weekend and it was PACKED. But with a reservation you were accommodated immediately. The service at first was slow but Achilles serviced my boyfriend and I and offered excellent hospitality. We started with the octopus and next to Puerto Rico it was the best octopus I've had. I got a shrimp dish and my boyfriend got lamb the flavors were incredible. He's hard to please when it comes to lamb and he practically licked his plate. I was so full since the gave me a salad along with my other sides. Having to hand peel the shrimp did get a bit messy but definitely worth it!Their wine selection was nice as well I love whites so I ordered Mythic River and it was so subtle and paired perfectly with my meal. The restaurant itself was nothing fancy but it was comfortable. It offered a warm escape to the freezing temperatures outside and you could wear a dress or jeans no one will look twice. Achilles gave us complementary baklava to end our evening and it was the best I have had. My boyfriend agreed saying it was next best to the one his grandmother used to make. I would highly recommend this place and if it's busy have patience because the food is worth it." u'My friend and I got here on a Monday evening we got seated right away and everything went smooth. I ordered the chicken souvlaki and my friend the pork souvlaki. A decent meal to a good price big portion!' u"Fresh ingredients solid execution! I spent a lot of time eating Greek food at family functions as a kid and everything we ordered here tasted just right to me. The portions were more than generous and prices were quite reasonable. We had horiatiki (fresh fresh fresh with notably tasty olive oil) souvlaki spanakopita (huge and delicious) pastichio horta baklava and galaktobouriko. I really wanted the farolakia and half a dozen other things but we had too much food as it was. Big thumbs up.Edited to add after reading some other reviews: we had food delivered so I can't speak to service or ambience but everything arrived quickly and at the perfect temperature." u'Pros: Very generous portion sizes; attentive and friendly staff; food is fresh and authenticCons: Ambience is a bit lacking; bathroom was filthy' u"Still great after all these years - today we had an early dinner after an off broadway matinee & everything was excellent. Highlights - grilled octopus starter grilled quail entree schawerma! Delicious. And they still have an excellent selection of wines by the glass. Everything fresh tasty and reasonably priced. Great service too. We'll be back again & this time we won't wait so long!" u'What a times square gem! \xa0Located literally across from hell aka port authority is some super delicious affordable greek food. \xa0When we arrived they put some DELICIOUS pita on the table. \xa0I am a girl who has been to Israel three times so trust me I know good pita.I got the old standby--spanikopita. \xa0Huge portion and absolutely delicious. \xa0My friend got the meat moussaka and loved it.Service was great.Also we went super early--like 5:30. \xa0We were the youngest people there by about 40 years. \xa0I dont hate it.' u"The Quick: Flavorful juicy lamb and tzatziki paired with fresh out of the oven pita.. Opa!The Details: If I was served by a gorgeous blue-eyed Greek man I might be persuaded I was in Greece. Note my female waitress was lovely but it's not the same effect.The lamb Gyro is fantastic as is the homemade sauces and pita. Get this with a side salad and you've hit a home run. The pork souvlaki was less impressive I would stick with lamb or chicken. I recommend the saganaki to start which is literally gooey fried cheese; diet friendly?The Damage: Four entrees and one split appetizer came to $23 each with a generous tip. Highly recommend." u'Have passed by here many times but have not tried the place before. \xa0A quick lunch was the introduction to Dafni and the food was good. \xa0The appetizer of octopus was grilled and tender although I usually expect it to be on a more of an and acid base it came dry and in pieces with lemon wedges. \xa0Price point was good so this is acceptable. \xa0The entr\xe9e was the branzino which was grilled and came whole with rice. Again a little more dry than I expected but was well cooked and a nice size. I would give it an average rating but for close to Times Square it is a good spot and I will return.' u"It's pretty good. Actually 3.5 stars considering the uber-touristy area. I think the standouts are the ambiance and the friendly service. The food itself was actually quite good also. The biggest disappointment was probably the Greek fries (they're just regular below average fries). But the gyros and charcoal grilled plates were all very decent if not slightly overcooked.We would go again if in the area..."]
115.Shimizu,[u'Excellent sushi bar that has both a common dining area where you eat with the \'people\' and a secret quieter area in the back. Best deal here is a sushi or sashimi deluxe which is generous and has huge price to portions ratio and value. I also recommend the Kobe beef carpaccio (sp) and the shrimp dumplings. Shimizu gets the vaunted "Merlin Five" because of an excellent dessert menu that doesn\'t just roll with lazy mochi/green tea ice cream and also contains my favorite item of all time: TEMPURA ICE CREAM which is surprisingly hard to get in this town! I was also impressed with the trilingual management and wait staff which busted out Mandarin Japanese and English. It gave the place a real cosmopolitan feel and defied dated and cheap stereotypes about Japanese ethnic parochialism.' u"Place is very popular now; Best to make a reservation which requires calling them. No opentable.MId-priced sushi establishment in NYC.Sushi is always fresh and they serve some pretty good appetizers as well.Can find some of the best sushi combination platters (Chef's Special at $55 - a bargain) in NYC here.Toro/scallion rolls are the best.A piece of otoro would have been nice but at $55 can't complain.Service was good.: 8 calendars" u"I live very close to Shimizu thus I wanted to try this sushi restaurant. I just moved in NY from Tokyo where I can enjoy the best quality sushi.The quality of sushi and service of Shimizu are more than expected. I really enjoyed Japanese taste like sushi. Also the price was so reasonable. I usually order omakase (chef's reco) and one day I had omakase for my lunch at a famous sushi restaurant close to 5th ave. It cost me $125! But here at Shimizu it was far less than that for dinner. Amazing.Also we can expect special dish with shrimp head. Today it was cooked with Miso soup. Tasty!The reason that I did not mark 5 star is that my usual sushi bar in Tokyo does better job (shigoto) as Edomae sushi.But I am a big fun of Shimizu already." u'Excellent sushi restaurant! They hand you warm scented towels before your meal. The place is very elegant and the staff are very professional.The meal started with a complimentary potato salad that was tiny but tasty (came with a chip on top). The shrimp dumpling appetizer was good with the accompanying sauce. The sushi was fresh and well-made. The service was very fast; the wait time for our dishes were very minimal. They have an impressive cocktail drink menu and they are strong and not watered down. The mango and green tea icecream was ordinary like other restaurants.This place is connected to a hotel and many of their tables had the "Reserved" sign on it so I suggest you make a reservation since this spot can fill up quickly. You have the option to sit at the bar area where it is nice to watch the chefs create your sushi dishes.' u"After my recent trip to Japan and a spoiled palette by the West Coast restaurants I walked into this mid-town joint with absolutely no expectation. We decided to go to Shimizu because it was the closest place that will take a reservation within 15 mins on a rainy night.First look at the menu got me annoyed at the midtown prices. So my friend and I got the $70 sushi platter for two - 3 rolls 10 pieces of sushi and 6 pieces of sashimi. That did not sound like a lot but man the portion was huge! The plate was probably enough for three people. For what you get though - sweet shrimp uni fatty tuna spider roll and a whole selection of good stuff - the price was so worth it. Albeit the uni and fatty tuna aren't the same quality as the West or Far East they are pretty damn good for NY. I love that the miso soup was cooked with the head from the sweet shrimp. Nice touch." u"Wonderful and unique home-made shrimp dumplings. Tempura wasn't crispy enough. Sushi was good but not spectacular. Beef teriyaki was a bit overcooked. Service was great. A bit expensive for what it is." u'Sushi was ok.But the other Japanese foods were good !I miss Japan now!' u'Wow!! I have been to many sushi restaurants. So many many people think I am partially Japanese and when I go I always think of my best sushi I have gotten in Japan and Las Vegas. So here I am in NYC at this restaurant that I did not plan to be at except the place I had intended to go was packed. I looked at other Yelp reviews and decided to come here. Boy was it wonderful pleasant and well priced. This place is far from expensive and for some of the best sushi in town I would pay double. The food is well prepared to include the rolls and sashimi. They ensure to pair your sashimi with oranges lemons and other greatness that provides flavor and awesome looks. We will definitely be back when we are back in NYC. This place is easily 5 stars and probably more if there was such a thing.' u'Really friendly service. Dumplings were amazing and the sushi was prepared fresh in front of us. Meal was great value for the quality of food' u"I do not understand how this place has a 4star rating. I couldn't have been more disappointed. We ordered the sushi deluxe and the sashimi deluxe but what you get is really basic sushi. (They might as well called it a 'regular') The fish quality is OK but the overall taste is below par. The salmon and white fish was stringly and too chewy the fatty tuna is not bad but really quality is just OK. The salmon roe sushi is poorly made. The scallop was fresh and probably the best piece. I think it's pretty overpriced for the quality you get. You can definitely find better sushi for cheaper but understandably there isn't much value in the theatre district. This place is at most a 3-star place. Service was good so that was a plus. But expect to wait long for ur sushi we waited for 30 mins." u'Quiet clean  decent price good food! Service is good and prefix is only 30 dollars for fresh oysters and sushi! (Also ice scream!)The portion might be little small for big eater but still the quality of the food is good!Will def go back!' u"Came looking for a local spot for some good sushi. I was quickly seated at the bar for one. The sushi is quite expensive here and the quality was highly variable. I had the following in my order:Salmon Skin Roll - Subpar quite chewy versus crunchySalmon sushi - Decent 4 starsKing Salmon sushi - Not very good I'm sure it wasn't freshAji - Not very good at all quality wiseFatty Tuna - Awesome hands down the best thing thereSide salad - Better than average!Okay place but inconsistent fish quality." u'Fresh decent service lightly fried items and not dosed in oil but prices are higher than your typical sushi spot.' u"Came here because the line to Ippudo across the street was crazy. \xa0Place itself was recommended by Yelp so we went. \xa0I'm not the biggest sushi eater (it mostly tastes the same to me besides fatty tuna yum) but it was still good." u"This is some great sushi and super convenient for a catching dinner before a show.I had some sashimi and a roll and my friend had chicken teriyaki. My sushi was so good I had to order another piece after I finished what I had. Super fresh and tasty the fatty tuna was just melt in your mouth.The rolls were ok definitely not the best I've ever had but the sashimi was right up there. My friend really enjoyed her dinner as well.Definitely a solid choice for sushi." u"Came here because I was craving for sashimi. Cravings satisfied. I ordered the $70 for 2 people option (3 rolls 10 sushi and 3 sashimi). You get to choose from a list they give you. They have limitations on what you can pick though. For the price and quality it is worth it. Place gets pretty crowded during dinner time so call ahead of time. Also they have free hot green tea (it's cold inside the restaurant). You can't go wrong with any of their options in the list. I picked the most expensive stuff on the list to make my money's worth haha. Must get fatty tuna though. Rainbow roll was good as well (not part of the $70 option). One last note avoid the chawan-mushi....it is just not my cup of tea especially for the price." u"Attended an event on 54th street so I ended up looking for a sushi bar in the theater district. After ordering a kanpachi yellowtail sushi a la carte to see if their sushi bar was up to snuff I decided to go for the sushi deluxe instead of the omakase. The yellowtail was fresh and the portion was generous but it wasnt anything impressive or worth remembering. The rest of the meal followed suit with average tasting fish and an overpriced sake offering. Avoid if you're looking for outstanding sushi" u'I enjoyed my time here. It\'s a nice little "fancy" Japanese restaurant where everyone greets you when you arrive provide you with a hot hand towel and a small starter dish. We got something that was similar to potato salad but it was delicious. I ordered a sashimi regular my boyfriend ordered the sashimi deluxe and then we shared a roll. The Mexican roll was tasty a bit more "americanized" as it was typical ingredients eel avocado yellowtail? jalapeno etc. but I really enjoyed it. The sashimi was fresh and decently sized - not too small where I\'d be mad at the value. It wasn\'t cheap but it wasn\'t one of the more expensive Japanese restaurants I\'ve had so I\'d say it\'s reasonably priced where you can get these meals for $20-$30 depending on your preference.Sadly the dessert ( the red bean with mochi syrup etc. ) was not good at all and maybe that\'s because I don\'t care for these ingredients but my boyfriend who does didn\'t care for the dish. We could\'ve done without it.Quite place it only ever had a few tables on this weekday night.' u'Easy review. \xa0Excellent fresh food. Excellent service. \xa0If you are looking for excellent sushi put this on your list!' u"Really delicious food- their sushi platter for 2 is great and they let you select everything- the rolls the nigiri and the sashimi. (Uni and medium fatty tuna are options too!) Wonderful birthday dinner :)Also the Yuzu sake was excellent! I'll definitely look for this again."]
11.B Squared,[u"On a recent first-time trip to NYC I spent my day playing tourist all-in-all walking/running over 16 miles. I decided it best to retroactively carb-load so I headed to B Squared in Hell's Kitchen. It was kind of by chance that I ended up at B Squared. Looking for Italian restaurants near my AirBNB I was confronted with a long list of equally well-starred restaurants. To be honest I picked B Squared because of the arrangement of their menu (not what was on the menu mind you just how it looked [hipster logic]). And thank goodness for that sexy menu because B Squared was the right choice.First things first B Squared has great drink options. My boyfriend tried a local raspberry something-or-other beer that looked like a porter but drank much lighter. I had a chardonnay on tap. Both were incredible and I'm sure had we been up for drinking more that the rest of the options would have proved equally satisfying. This seems like a place that cares about what it serves down to the very last drop. The food was something else though. Sure I was starving. But I think despite my hunger-pains that the food was objectively incredible. We started our meal with the roasted avocado (sans anchovy because veghead). I've always been a bit wary of hot avocado-- I don't like what the heat does to the texture of the fruit. But B Squared was one step ahead only lightly roasting the avocado maintaining it's texture while enhancing it's flavor. If you're an avocado fan I wouldn't skip this appetizer. Next was the pasta. Oh the pasta. While there was only two vegetarian-friendly pasta dishes on the menu this proved sufficient as I wanted the cacio pepe and my boyfriend wanted the rigatoni. Served with shells the cacio pepe is everything you want from comfort food. Al dente pasta rich and creamy sauce flavor that makes you want to close your eyes as you bite-- the stuff upon which dreams are made. The rigatoni produced a similar reaction in the boyfriend with its sweet tomato sauce creamy burrata and crunchy bread crumbs. The bowls were embarrassingly clean as our server cleared them from the table.And let's talk about that server-- that vivacious effervescent woman who could warm the heart of even the most steely of humans. Who danced when I told her I loved my meal leaving a smile on my face long after her moves were over. She was the cherry atop a perfect meal." u"After attending a performance of Swan Lake with the great Misty Copeland my niece and I went in search for a bite to eat. We stumbled across this place while walking down 9th Ave.We were greeted with a welcoming blast of cool air conditioning that confirmed our wise choice to escape the summer heat.We ordered the Marge with half sopressata. It was delicious. Love the thin crust. The service was efficient and helpful. I'd definitely return." u"Their pizzas almost makes me cry. In a good way. NYC fave! Is just so extremely goooooooood! The Killer Bee and Spicoli are my faves and it's great to share the two. There is also a lot of other great choices both for meat lovers and vegetarians. I don't even want to leave the crust behind. Pizzas are around $16 not bad for the quality. This restaurant is a bigger version of B Side Pizza (which is just as good) but this location is better for bigger groups." u"We dropped in on a Monday night for a light bite after our flight in from California.I wanted really good pizza and a quick search of Yelp lead us here.We weren't too hungry and had plans to start a food crawl so we just ordered the Killer Bee pizza. Others have talked about it it's as good as they say. BF had his doubts about honey on pizza but it works. The pizza was savory with a slight sweetness that elevated the flavor of the ingredients. The crust was thin and crunchy in bottom and light and crisp on the outside. So good!We ordered 4 drinks and to be honest they weren't too memorable. I wish we had time to go back for more food! Everything on the menu looked good." u"I was really excited to try this place and get my fix of NYC pizza before I left. Unfortunately this did not hit the spot. Their Black Kale salad was great!! But I didn't come from Cali to NYC to indulge in kale! I would however recommend it. We got the carbonara pizza. There was an undercooked/runny poached/boiled egg on top. Overall was not what I was looking for. Thankfully my friend didn't mind me eating all the crust with a side of marinara and pepper flakes. Next time I'll leave carbonara for pasta and go with a more traditional pizza." u"Amazing pizza! Soooo yummy! Incredible craft beer on draft! Holy Mother! Soooo good! PLEASE Hell's Kitchen - keep this joint going! So good - and I wholeheartedly admit that I'm a snob - this place is yummy!!!!!" u'Great pizza bar with a cute atmosphere. Can sit at the bar while waiting for a table. My friend got a Gin drink which was very yummy. Good Sangria as well (I think they only have one kind - regular). We got two (personal sized I guess you could say) pizzas - one with olives and artichokes and one with kale and spinach; both were quite good and pair well with wine or sangria. Also got a meatball appetizer as well as a fried avocado salad - yummy. Great place for "fancy" pizza and drinks with friends.' u'A very nice place a block from the theatre district. Great drinks awesome pizza but what really recommends it is the nice and easy atmosphere. Friendly and helpful (Sexton helped me figure out what I wanted to drink God bless him) and relaxed. What a great place! \xa0Highly recommend!!!Wrote this review before dessert so have to add that the desserts are awesome!! Pana Cotta was sublime and the Tiramisu reminded me of Italy. So delicious!!!!! \xa0You MUST check out this wonderful restaurant!!' u'I LOVED my experience here but I prefer the more quiet space up the street a few blocks. \xa0The reason why they are getting 4 stars is because I ordered the Don Ho and there were NO pickled fresno chiles. \xa0I wanted the sweet with the salty and if they were indeed out they should have told us so you lose a star. \xa0I will have to return and see if it happens again.' u'It\'s official ! "THE NORMA" is on the menu!We have been going to "B side" a few years now and since "B squared" has opened we come here more often. The new menu starts today. All the pizzas are great but "The Norma" is a must. B Squared is a great spot to have a great time and enjoying the great pizzas. There\'s even a bar to grab a cocktail. The people that work there are very nice and positive. \xa0A group of friends on a date or a family B squared has the perfect atmosphere for any situation. Thanks for putting our "NORMA" on the menu.' u"Came here while in Hell's Kitchen today. Just a forewarning this place is not true NYC pizza it's a specialty pizza place. If you are expecting pizza with traditional toppings look else where. The service at this place is amazing the waiter took our drink orders and food orders very quickly. I ordered the meatpacking pizza which looked good on paper but didn't translate well into the pie itself. The toppings were overwhelming and there was hardly any cheese or sauce on the pie. I would give this place another shot if I got a different type of pizza next time." u"This is a social place for my GF and I. \xa0The first time we came in the bartender took such good care of us! \xa0 If you think NYC doesn't have great service you've never been here!! The drinks beer wine and food are all thought out to pair well. \xa0Everything is high quality with a side of charming. \xa0Simple food with a flare for the brilliant!" u'The pizza is some of the best in the city assuming your preference is for the hipster Neapolitan style. The varieties of topping selections are quite creative. Most important the crust is not dry and puffy like much Neapolitan style pies but rather crispy and pliable. My one quibble is with the service which is pleasant but rather rushed in pursuit of the obvious goal of turning tables to make money. Also it is lacking a busboy and instead leave the host to do that job. Wines are mediocre and expensive.' u"Went for an impromptu dinner in Hell's Kitchen. This place is great for their pizzas. We also tried their craft beer which was good and strong as well. Can't say much because I'm a little tipsy of my La Fin Du Monde craft beer. Seating is limited to 2-3 parties. No parking... Obviously. Other than that everything was great." u'Got dinner here with my parents and fianc\xe9 before a Broadway show. Pizza was great and priced fair. Would recommend 3 pizzas for a group of 4 or 2 pizzas with apps. Nice service as well.' u'Visiting NYC. So glad I found this place. Great pizza great service fun atmosphere.It is also a few blocks away from the chaos of time square. A plus' u"Have eaten at the other one but just ordered take out today from here. \xa0First of all the online menu is a bit different. After deciding what I wanted trying to call in the order (no answer but the gal there fixed it when I told her it wasn't going through) and then walking in I saw their actual menu and the pizza I had settle on was not on their actual menu! BUMMER! \xa0Also I noticed they had a few not online. I ended up getting the kale salad (good!) and the Killer Bee. I had it at the other place and remember it being a tad salty but due to all the rave reviews I wanted to try it again. Yeah still a tad salty. I would not suggest ordering this to go. It ends up soggy on the bottom so that was unpleasant...not worth the price for soggy salty pizza.Overall the customer service was great but I'm not sure if the whole thing was worth the price. I would get the salad again but also maybe a tad $$ for the portion." u'A little pricey but good food. Both pasta and pizza have a good selection and are quite tasty. The atmosphere is nice though a little loud.' u"Decent pizza. We got the Don Ho pizza and Marge pizza. Their Don Ho pizza with prosciutto and ham was good! I really enjoyed it! Their Marge was meh because it lacked in mozzarella and basil. I also wasn't a huge fan of the crust but you'll probably like the crust if you like harder drier crusts.Pretty fast (we got two pizzas for take out and they were ready within 15 minutes). Very friendly waitstaff.The store has a rustic wooden look. It seemed like it would be good for drinks and pizza on the side after work.(Side note: the pizza is really similar to the B Side Pizza a few blocks uptown. Is it just a coincidence that the names are similar?)" u"The food here is wonderful so I'm disappointed to not be giving five stars. However it is 2016-- there should not be issues surrounding splitting checks on more than one credit card especially considering this company owns multiple restaurants. Further we split a check here less than a week ago without issue. Bottom line this incident will cause us to go elsewhere when dining with a group to avoid the hassle of having cash or fussing with paying people back."]
118.Paul’s On Times Square,[u'We went there last month for our anniversary. The concept is modern and original/technological. Drinks are original. Food is great made with rare tasty & high quality ingredients.The service is amazing & the hostess was the best she recommended the best place in NYC for me to propose to my fianc\xe9. Thank you' u'Please note: This restaurant is inside of a hotel. The food is delicious.' u'Trendy quiet place around Times Square to have a chat with a friend or drinks. But it is touristy times squares the best bars are probably just not in this neighborhood and drinks tend to be overpriced. $16-$18 per drink. You can get better drinks in west village or east village probably for $12.Got the "miracle on time square" -- pink very fruity sweet drink.' u'Tiny space in Hilton Garden Inn hotel on 42 street decor is nice but one side of the wall is so bright from the light at dinner time. It would be romantic if they dim the light. Food is great  not bad at all. \xa0Try their pappardelle with truffle sauce perfect. Service is good. Will highly recommend to try but it might be hard to find this restaurant cause it is on 2nd floor of the building. So  look for the sign of Hilton Garden Inn.' u"We were on vacations in New York and this past Monday we celebrated my wife's birthday at your restaurant and we were really pleased with the ambiance the good service and specially the delicious food... everything was excellent!I definitely recommend it!" u"A great Italian restaurant tucked inside the Hilton Garden Inn Paul's should be frequented by locals and tourists alike. They have a wide selection of small plates and entrees. Our table shared the Margherita pizza duck pizza burrata cheese and artichoke hearts. Surprisingly the artichoke hearts were a big hit! Most of the pastas are homemade. I had the ravioli in thyme sauce a white cream sauce full of flavor. Will be back just for those! There's also happy hour (bar only) and a little balcony. Great for post-show drinks!" u"First of all the service was amazing! Great Italian food. \xa0What a surprise to find such a great Italian restaurant in a hotel in Times Square New York.I had the breaded calamari as an appetizer and then the fruition de mare \xa0dish as a main course. My wife had the muscles as in appetizer and loved it!I'd come back again in a heartbeat. People really cared about creating a great value!" u"Bar/Prices: I came in during my stay and ordered an extra dirty martini however it was not dirty so asked for more olive juice and it still tasted like a lot more vodka than dirty. I get prices in NY are high but $15 for martinis are a bit higher than the norm. Food: The morning after I had an interview and coming down for lunch at the hotel was convenient plus with all the good reviews I thought I may give it a chance.Unfortunately they do not offer the pasta with truffle sauce for lunch so got the shrimp with black linguine and spicy sauce instead. What I got did not all all resemble everyone else's picture. I had a lot of very small shrimp and it very well may have been fresh but frozen baby shrimp tastes exactly the same. Also the sauce was very bland no spice at all. I asked the waitress and she said it may be because a lot of people don't like spice but- there was not one hint of it in the dish. I was also not offered bread with my meal and I had seen others around me offered.The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I should have asked about pricing before hand before ordering the martini and should have asked the waitress about the reason for the disconnect in dishes but since I was in a rush to get to my interview I did not want to spend more time than I needed to." u'Great food and Mariana gave us great service. Try the black linguini and breakfast pizza. Siting outside is a must the view alone is worth the Groupon .' u"Friday 06/03/16. 11:30aWe ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was unlike any other I've had. Not super oily or extremely breaded. Seasoning and dipping sauce were perfect.Had the pizza with the artichoke. Tasty as well. Then we shared 2 pastas-- the Frutti De Mare (SP?) and the penn pasta with vodka sauce & salmon. Both pastas were so delicious! The seafood tasted fresh. The seafood to pasta ratio was on point; they were not stingy with seafood at all on both plates. Service was excellent. EVERYONE not just our server was super friendly. They were all very caring and made sure we enjoyed our dining experience." u"Food was decent. I had a Groupon. I wouldn't say the food is worth full price at all." u"This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I'm in town! \xa0To begin the food is absolutely delish! \xa0I love the rice balls and fig pizza to die for and nothing like I have ever tasted before!! \xa0The waitstaff is extremely friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. It has been a few months since I last visited however I will be in town tomorrow and hoping to stop by for the best Rosemary gin fizz I ever had! \xa0Henry and Adrianna are my favorite servers working across the street makes the Hilton Garden Inn my number 1 pick every time! \xa0I don't understand the negative reviews... it's Time Square people expect to open your wallets if you want to experience the best of the best! \xa0Keep up the great work Paul & Team!" u"This place was great. Our waiter and server were very friendly and the food was so yummy. It was a great experience. We had a groupon and was scared they'd treat us differently but that wasn't the case at all. Thank you guys for a great dinner experience!" u"Stopped in to this lively place for a drink after a couple other bars were found to be unavailable for the evening and overall I'd say this a solid option for either happy hour or late night socializing. We each picked a drink off of the cocktail menu and while I can't remember the names of either of them both turned out to be really good and it seemed like their alcohol selection was extensive enough to meet just about any request. The bar area is perfectly positioned for mixing mingling people watching and checking out amazing views of the phenomenon outside that is Times Square and the decor is a nice mix of elegance and comfort. I can definitely see this place as both a hub for downtown locals to socialize as well as a place for tourists and travelers to unwind and get to know the city and it's people a little bit better." u'This is a fancy Italian meal experience right on Times Square. I went to this place after buying a coupon from Group on which had two appetizers and two entrees for two people. We had a bruschetta and a margarita Pizza for appetizer and butternut squash Ravioli & Whole wheat Spaghetti in Primavera sauce as entrees. The food was toasty n warm. N above all the nicely done ambiance made it a perfect Sunday brunch time..' u"Never did I think that I would have such an abundant tasty dinner in Times Square for $45. I purchased the Groupon deal - 2 appetizers and 2 pasta meals and was greatly pleased! We were promptly seated at arrival (also just an FYI you have to go upstairs to the Hotel Lobby to find the restaurant. ..was a bit confusing at first). We ordered the Quattro fromagio pizza and calamari to start and jeez were they good! Both plates were big sizes. The calamari was nice and crispy and the pizza was great as well....although I felt like it needed a sauce so the calamari's marinara sauce went well with it ;)Once we finished with the appetizers we didn't even know how we were going to fit our main course because of how big the plates were.My boyfriend ordered the penne ala vodka with Salmon and I got the Ravilois. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the vodka sauce was great. The Ravilois were huge filled with ricotta and the sauce with the sun dried tomatoes was amazing!For drinks (not included in the groupon) I got a blue margarita - which was pricey for my liking but it was \xa0strong so it was worth it.The service was good although we were charged a pretty hefty service charge which was unexpected but I suppose it comes with the experience and meal we recieved.Overall I was very pleased." u'We have eaten there a few times and intend on doing so again and again. Very good pasta selection and salads. Drinks are not just splashed with alcohol like so many places. Good service appealing decor and reasonable prices make this a pleasing place to be.' u'We got the Groupon deal which for $45 is two aps and two PASTA entrees. Just a note that this place was not very easy to find. We knew it was at the Hilton Garden Inn but you walk in and there is no signage and you are just left to figure out where to go. We went to the lobby floor and got directed there but that can be confusing for guests.We did have a reservation and were promptly seated. I personally did not like the seating. We were just inches away from another couple on both sides of us there really wasnt any elbow room. The biggest reason that I gave this restaurant two stars was the service. Our server came over to take our order and that was literally the only time we saw her. No one came over to ask us if we needed anything else ask how everything was etc. I had to flag down a bus boy to get our check. I think she knew that we were using a Groupon but then again I saw the people next to us ( in both directions - using the same promo ) When she came back with the bill looking for a 15% min tip I was rather surprised. ( that would have been about $15 which I think is a healthy tip for just taking someones order )The food itself was ok. The bolganese pasta I ordered was way over salted and the calamari usually has two dipping sauces and just came with a marinara sauce and was a little rubbery.Overall I think it could have been a nicer meal if we were seated elsewhere and had a better server.' u"Who could ask for anything more! Location was great; atmosphere was inviting and relaxing yet sophisticated. I went with my daughter who is 8 years old and the staff was very attentive and patient. Now for the food...luckily it's NYC restaurant week so we tried out the pre fixed dinner menu. \xa0I had the four cheese pizza as my appetizer...couldn't even finish it when my entree came penne Ala vodka with smoked salmon...DELISH!!! Then ended my dinner with the chocolate mouse which was very rich and smooth. Just the right amount of sweetness. I will definitely visit again!" u"Just came here for dessert after dinner but it's a cute little restaurant located inside of the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square. The service was okay but they had a good selection of desserts & it was very good! A little pricey... But a good place for a quick dessert or even a meal. I haven't tried their main dishes but their pastas look delicious!"]
178.Leon Bakery Mexican Restaurant,[u'i love this place! their burritos and quesadillas are amazing' u"Good eats. I had an al pastor torta and it was awesome. \xa0When I got home I was pleasantly surprised how big the sandwich was.It was also delicious! \xa0The restaurant also has a pretty big bakery case if you're looking for some Mexican pastries." u'Sometimes you don\'t want to cook but you also don\'t want to spend too much money.You don\'t want to sit down in a full service restaurant but a generic place like Chipotle or Panera won\'t cut it either (you ARE in New York City after all). I was in one of those moods yesterday. Walking around the City with some time to burn before an appointment I was craving a cheap and filling dinner that didn\'t leave a hole in my wallet (we lovingly call those "platos de obero" where I\'m from which translates into a working-class meal). Xi\'an Famous Foods in Midtown was packed (and they caution against taking out their noodles anyways) so I kept on walking. My phone was buggy when I tried pulling up the Yelp app as I arrived in Hell\'s Kitchen but this place and its rating caught my eye. I actually missed it walking down the block as Leon Bakery is quite unassuming and simple looks out of place. As usual Yelp led me to a great find. In a neighborhood like HK it\'s quite an anachronism but what a delicious one it is. I\'d expect to see a restaurant like this in Sunset Park Brooklyn but not on 9th Ave. The interior is painted in a bright orange hue the walls are lined with Mexican staples (from canned beans to dried chilies and tamales flour). There are three tables by the back close to a television playing the latest Univision telenovelas ("Por qu\xe9 Mar\xeda?! Rompiste mi coraz\xf3n!!") I ate next to an extended Mexican family further proof that this place is authentic. The cashier let me know that they only made tamales during the morning (and I\'ve read enough to know that they\'re a very labor intensive dish). I settled on ordering a torta sandwich which is layered with refried beans iceberg lettuce tomato avocados white Mexican cheese and your choice of jalape\xf1o strips or chipotle. My meat of choice was pork al pastor. Sadly they only accept credit cards for orders over $10 (during this quarter my credit card offers me 5% cash back on restaurants but unfortunately all the places I end up craving turn out to be cash only! Darn!)Back in Puerto Rico we have a street cart that sells a sandwich known as "the tripleta." It\'s an assortment of meats piled high with lettuce tomato and mayo-ketchup on a soft cushy roll. This is the Mexican version and don\'t tell my fellow Boricuas but I actually liked this sandwich more.The avocados (that Hail Mary of foods) were on-point green as can be. The cheese was slightly melted and slightly chewy providing additional texture. I enjoyed the pork--melted in my mouth and well seasoned overall. And you can tell that bread is baked on site probably. While at first glance you probably think it\'s not sturdy enough to hold all of its contents intact I think its soft texture is better suited for this type of sandwich. My meal came down to $7. I ate half of my sandwich at the restaurant and splurged on the remaining half as a midnight snack (to be fair I had worked out and walked a lot that day).The only flaw with my meal was that I found a piece of bay leaf in my sandwich. While bay leaves give great flavor during the cooking process they\'re not edible and should be removed before serving. Le\xf3n is easily one of the top three lowkey Mexican places I\'ve tried in the City. I\'m rarely this far west unless I\'m going bar hopping later at night but I am compelled to go back. Buen trabajo Le\xf3n Bakery!' u"They have PAN. I am sooo exited. It's a HOLE in the wall you walk in and to your right you are blessed with PAN. I am totally coming back to purchase from this spot. Can't wait. Sooooo glad I found it. AHHH I LOVE 9th street." u"Great food! Aside from going and ordering takeout I've also placed 2 dozen tamale order for a party I was going to. The tamales were great and I was the hit of the party ;)" u'Chilequilas are excellent and the portions are very large. \xa0Not the fanciest place but great for take-out or delivery.' u'Very friendly people the bakery is authentic mexican breadalong with many other delicious products. Food was very good and filling. Yumm If your looking for mexican food in NYC check this small delicious place out.' u'Finally a great authentic Mexican place in midtown! Clean authentic fresh well priced and delicious!' u'Best Mexican food that I have had (besides my favorite food cart outside of Metropolitan Hospital) in New York City. \xa0Period. \xa0By far.How real is this place? \xa0I ordered the bistec con nopales and the lady went and got FRESH CACTUS OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR.' u'Always see this little restaurant when I am on my way to work... Today I decided to buy with my two coworkers. I order the Gorditas (homemade stuffed tortillas) unfortunately the tortilla tasted like it was kept in the fridge from previous days. \xa0The pork rinds were soggy and had no salt what so ever. \xa0I also ordered a so called fresh water and it just didnt look like something I would want to drink at all.My coworker order tacos and as he said they were so-so and the other didnt even finish his food.' u"Came here after a 4 day binge of italian food street food of all sorts while on vacation in NYC (i missed my mexican food) and wow i had the best chicken chilaquiles I've ever had at any restaurant they were really good and it was a big portion i even joked with my wife that they were on par with my mom's also they have mexican sweet bread and all sorts of and a variety of latin items. It's a good place to try when you're in the mood for great mexican chilaquiles." u"The 5th star will likely follow after I've tried more of their menu.Leon Bakery is quickly becoming a normal stop on my morning commute. \xa0I would regularly pick up tamales (2 cheese and one spicy chicken delicious!) for myself and for friends and today I decided to try something different. \xa0The lady behind the counter is very kind and friendly. \xa0Though I waited a little while for my Breaded Chicken Cemitas (with chipotle sauce) and guacacmole it was worth it. \xa0Knowing it's all made very fresh I happily walked around studying their baked goods. \xa0I asked if they have Pan con Queso and she even offered me a free roll. \xa0Light and fluffy with a big wad of Queso Blanco in the middle. \xa0What a breakfast! \xa0The chips were thick and crispy the guacamole fresh and very tasty and the Cemitas: \xa0Oh so smoky piled high with breaded chicken guacamole queso blanco and chipotle sauce. \xa0No filler nothing but taste. \xa0Prices are very reasonable and if I have one gripe (if you want to call it that.) they don't have a California Burrito on the menu. \xa0Perhaps I could just ask them next time for a steak burrito with refried beans and french fries and hopefully she won't look at me funny. \xa0It may be a bit of a hidden gem in Hell's Kitchen but I'm so happy I found it." u'Tamales and chilaquiles topped with fried eggs for breakfast. \xa0Best spot in the neighborhood. \xa0Tamales run out fast...go early!' u"Places like this will always bring me back its about good food and making it right. Happen to stop by the double D's next door and some how found this gem. The woman behind the counter did not speak much English but kept the most beautiful smile. I went for the Chilaquiles crispy tortilla chips cooked with green or red salsa & topped with sour cream and cheese for a little extra you can add beef or chicken don't forget the to add to fried eggs $1.00 extra.Leon Bakery is not the most aesthetically looking food. Same goes for the d\xe9cor. Their purpose is to produce authentic Mexican food. Trust me I have a problem with food that sits on a plate and it's all the same pigment just weird me out but when you take your first bite its walk in Mexico well worth the ugly palette. Next I tried Cemitas just thinking about it makes my mouth water beans Mexican cheese avocado papolo and chayote. So if ever in HK stop buy have a taste of Mexico with out destroying your pockets." u'So glad my friend showed me this place just around the corner from my apartment.Huge portions of delicious Mexican food at good prices. \xa05 years after moving away from CA I finally feel like I have a local Mexican food spot that I can be happy about again!' u'my search for a good mexican place in nyc might be complete! so i was walking around looking for lunch! first i wanted a turkey sandwich - than i wanted a chicken salad - than passed a different mexican place and got a craving for a burrito. i guess i was just looking for a place to draw me in and a place where i could get whatever for under $10 and i saw a sign "authentic mexican" and i was impressed by their menu and went on in.it took a bit of time for them to make the burrito i must say but it seemed like they had maybe 3 really big orders before me so i\'ll let that pass. the burrito was (is still haven\'t finished it) so very good. nicely sized proportioned right and extremely tasty. I shouldn\'t have put that much red sauce on it lol but its not a situation where i cant eat because its TOO spicy so i am very satisfied and will go back again as their menu had lots of choices i need to try.' u"If you walk along 9th Avenue you'll probably miss this little shop from all the other fancier & flashier restaurants that reside in the area. That makes this the perfect little gem in an otherwise pricey neighborhood.Leon Bakery has as authentic Mexican food as can be found in the city. I've came here more than once for their tamales a complete bargain at $1.50 per. The pastries are all baked fresh but I find myself more entranced by the rest of their menu with each subsequent visit. Having recently discovered the magical Tortas of Mexican cuisine I ordered their Chorizo Torta and was not disappointed at all. Crunchy bread fresh vegetables and a nice little kick to the Chorizo.If you're ever looking for a quick bite for lunch or a small snack look no further than this place. Their prices are modest compared to their neighbors and the food is delicious. \xa0I definitely see myself coming back to try the other things on their menu." u"As a resident of Hells Kitchen for the past 4 years I've walked by this place countless times until recently I noticed it on my walk home from the gym. I was in the mood for a beef quesadilla and popped right in. Immediately I felt like I discovered a foodie secret! This place is a bakery/deli/quaint sit-down restaurant rolled up all in one. They've got fruity/health juices as well. I am a native Texan and know was good Tex-Mex tastes like---this was pretty damned good. Also they've got the tv on a spanish language channel---it felt pretty authentic vs. playing top 40 music.I was pretty satisfied with the beef quesadilla I ordered and the beans on the side.They definitely did not skimp out on the beef portions! The food was so good that right after I ate my fill that I had a pleasant 3 hour food coma induced nap afterwards.I will definitely be back soon! The service was quick and friendly too." u"Leon Bakery is one of my guilty pleasures in Hell's Kitchen. I've been coming to this Mexican bakery for years for their pastries (see photo). The pastries are devoid of classical French or Italian sensibilities: they're dry sometimes chalky typically covered with granulated sugar instead of powdered and occasionally just plain greasy. But they're SOOOO GOOD and ADDICTIVE! I can't explain it. Maybe it's just me but I suspect it's not. Oh and the prices are surreal only about a dollar each." u"Pretty solid taco spot on Ninth... It's not as good as the other 2 neighborhood staples tho - Guelgazeta and Tehutzingo a bit further west..."]
16.Hourglass Tavern,[u"This tiny little spot on Restaurant Row is truly a gem. My friends and I wanted a place with good variety so we decided to try our luck here. Two of us got the Orecchiette Primavera and the other ordered the Salmon. The food came promptly and was absolutely delicious. The pasta was seasoned well and the veggies tasted fresh. They also offer inexpensive drinks and a prix-fixe dinner menu for people heading to or from the theatre. The ambience has an old small tavern feel to it. There are 3 stories (restaurant on 1 bar on 2 and lounge on 3). The first floor sat only about 25-30 people but the cramped space was in no way cumbersome during our meal. We lucked out getting a spot but i'd recommend making a reservation if you're planning to come on a busy night. Service was excellent as well. Our water was knowledgeable and made some recommendations to my friends. He was also attentive and took time to chat with us. I'll definitely be back whether it's for Brunch Pre-theatre Prix-Fixe or another nice dinner. The prices are excellent and the food is divine." u"Dirty!!!! My napkin had a dead fly on it. Silverware wasn't fully clean and neither was my glass for the mango mimosa. Had a reservation at 11:30 am on Saturday for brunch and was seated promptly on the third floor. The lady at the front was friendly and accommodating. Service stopped on the first floor because it was non existent when we got to the third. Had to flag down the server every time we needed something. Got the eggs and short rib hash - came with asparagus. Food took forever to come out. Was really good but it wasn't filling. Bloody Mary was really spicy - just a heads up but I enjoyed it. Stars for a decent priced brunch but don't think I'd return." u"4.5 stars. Came here for the Bettibar (second floor of this place) happy hour and was not disappointed. First let me just say that the only other late happy hour that I've found and really enjoyed is Verlaine so was really happy to add to my list! Bettibar has $5 sangria well drinks and beers until 10 pm. I tried the sangria and it was delicious-very fruity but also fairly strong. I also tried one of the pulled pork sliders-10/10. They pack a spicy kick and go really well with any drink you're having. Definitely a great place in Midtown West!" u"Found this place after a quick search for brunch spots in the Theater district. It has fours stars and nearly 500 reviews so figured it must be good! Well turns out those reviews must be for dinner/bar because they just started serving brunch not to long before we went (back in March '16). And well they still have some kinks to work out at the time. We made reservations for 11:30am (which is the time they open of Sundays) and when we arrived it was clear they we not ready for us or the other customers who also were arriving for 11:30am reservations. We were taken to the third floor and sat at a table right next to the waiter prep area. Since I assume the kitchen is on the first floor this area is used as a bar/coffee prep area by the waiters. Several times during the meal all we good hear was the head waitress (for lack of better name) explaining to the other waiters what to do. Not very pleasant. I ordered a mimosa and coffee to drink. I later discovered (I overhead the waiters taking) that they had flavored coffee. For my second coffee I asked for that since was never offered it. To start they brought out two mini muffins which would of been nice if mine wasn't burnt. For my meal I got the Oven Baked Potato Pancakes and cheese grits. The potato pancakes were good and came topped with smoked salmon. But the cheese girts we not edible. The cheese was hard as could be on top. I sent them back and had to ask for them to be taken off the bill. My fiance got the Seasonal Belgian Waffles which we would of thought the strawberries would of been in the waffles instead of simply on top. But they were still tasty. All in all not sure I would go back again for brunch. The services was slow and the food wasn't all that good." u'We like to go here before theater in nyc. Great food. Casual atmosphere. Some in our party had the pre fix dinner for 23.95. I had to try the brisket sliders and cocnut rice.' u"Relatively cheap for a Sunday brunch in midtown! It looks tight when you come in but there's also outside and upstairs seating. Brunch came with cranberry muffins and $5 happy hour WUT!!!! I got the red wine sangria which was cool and refreshing. Entree: spring smoked trout---served O green w quinoa and pita bread. So light and perfect for brunch cleanse. My friends got the eggs w short rib hash and Belgian waffles which they cleaned off their plates." u'Location/Accessibility : Super convenient location for me; just 4 blocks away! \xa0Nice short walk and pretty easy to find. \xa0Pretty much right in-between the 42nd St and 50th St stops on the ACE. \xa0Ambience : Inside on the first floor seemed a bit tight. \xa0This kind of deterred me from wanting to sit inside to tbh I didn\'t get a great look at the place. \xa0There are also several floors to this place which I didn\'t get to see. \xa0Unfortunately I\'m not able to comment much on this aspect. \xa0My boyfriend and I decided to sit outside since it was a nice day. \xa0For the most part it felt like the nice outdoor mini cafe vibe but since the restaurant is close to the corner of 9th Ave when sirens were coming down the street you sure did here them blare (but eh expected in the city). \xa0Service : \xa0My boyfriend and I were seated promptly with our reservation. \xa0Often when I sit outside at restaurants I can\'t help but feel forgotten because there are such long periods of time in which there is no contact with any servers/runners/etc. \xa0This wasn\'t an issue here! \xa0Our server was good and made sure to address what was necessary both good and "bad." \xa0Now when I say bad it wasn\'t even bad. \xa0Our drinks took a while to come out but he apologized upon delivery. \xa0Otherwise the food came out in a timely manner and he was very attentive and polite.Food and Drink :So I never really drink bc it\'s so hard for me to find a drink that I like. \xa0Usually I get drinks when it\'s a social outing just because but always find myself having to down it just so I don\'t waste the money. \xa0However the brunch drinks were $5 which is a pretty good deal in the city so hey why not?Mad Mimosa w Peach Nectar - So typically I\'m not a fan of mimosas bc I complain that they\'re still more bitter than I like. \xa0This mimosa was a great hit though! \xa0Very bubbly but also very sweet! \xa0I would definitely get it again.Cinnamon Strongman - my boyfriend got this and I tried it. \xa0It certainly didn\'t taste like there was any alcohol in it but there most definitely was (that Asian glow doesn\'t lie!!). \xa0My kind of drink although I would prefer something a bit sweeter.Mango and Peach Juice *complimentary* - these are included with your brunch??? How nice! \xa0How often do restaurants charge (more often OVER charge) for a glass of juice? \xa0While these glasses were small boy were they concentrated. \xa0I very much appreciated that they didn\'t skimp out and water it down as I would\'ve expected of a "free" drink. \xa0Brownie points!And of course the food...Strawberry Muffins *complimentary* - How nice and how cute. \xa0The muffin wasn\'t overly sweet nor was it heavy. \xa0It had a really nice and natural strawberry flavor. \xa0A perfect start to brunch.Oven Baked Potato Pancakes - If you like smoked salmon this dish is wonderful! \xa0Salmon itself was awesome and the potato pancakes were amazingly crispy! \xa0Add the dill sauce to it for a really refreshing element. \xa0Eggs and Short Rib Hash - Eggs cooked well : over easy. \xa0Accompanied the hash well! \xa0The short ribs and potato were very flavorful with a great texture. \xa0If you like crispy hash though then this probably isn\'t for you. \xa0My only complaint is the amount of pepper in the hash as I\'m not big on bell peppers (although it did add some nice color to the dish). \xa0But for anyone that is this is a good dish for you!While I probably won\'t be back (on a mission to try as many places as possible during my limited time here) overall this was a great brunch spot! \xa0Certainly recommend giving it a try!' u"Hourglass Tavern was a cool find and one of the best brunch spots I've ever been to! \xa0It's a small restaurant but there's so much character to it.Brunch is available on weekends and they have $5 brunch booze. WHAT?! $5?! \xa0I had to start my day with a mango mimosa and it was absolutely delish. While I was waiting for my short rib hash I was served a cranberry orange muffin. Excellent. The hash came out shortly and it was so good. All the flavors meld together so perfectly with the egg and potatoes. I mopped my plate clean. \xa0My only gripe was it was a little bit on the oily side but that didn't stop me.Service from Katie was so great as well! She made me feel comfortable dining alone since it was a work trip and my other coworkers were hibernating from the valentine's weekend freeze. Hourglass Tavern was worth braving negative degree windchill weather for! PS: 10% discount off weekend brunch food items for checking in on Yelp!" u'I\'ve had the Hourglass Tavern on my bookmarks list for a while because they have happy hour until 10 pm. But when I finally came in it was for a different reason. Brunch. Oh yeah and the $5 brunch drinks (bloody Mary mango or orange mimosa cinnamon Irish coffee screwdriver sangria).I never bothered to look at Yelper-posted pictures of the place so I just assumed that it\'s like any other bar that serves brunch - spacious. The place opens on Saturdays at 11:30 my boyfriend and I were set to get there at 12. All of these components make it seem like there would be no issue with getting a table right? Wrong! Never assume and always make a reservation! When we got there we were both surprised at how small the place was. Luckily they had an upstairs (which looks like it used to be an apartment) and after waiting about 5 minutes at the bar we were able to nab the last table.Although I\'m not a fan of flavored coffees or flavored liquors for that matter I went against my best judgement and ordered the Cinnamon Strongman which is an Irish coffee made with cinnamon-flavored whiskey. To my surprise it was actually pretty good. Good enough that I ordered a second one even though I think it might have been more for the caffeine benefit.For my entree I went with the oven baked potato pancakes (3 pancakes topped with smoked salmon with dill sour cream chopped Chives). This was great! The potato pancakes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My two pieces of constructive criticism are that I wish there was more smoked salmon (it came with 3 small pieces) and that they could have put the dill sour cream in a small dish to make it more presentable. It was kind of just haphazardly stashed in the corner of the plate.Although I did like my food I\'m not sure if I\'d come back for brunch. The place feels a bit cramped. Plus I don\'t think there was anything else on the menu that really stood out to me that made me think - "I MUST COME BACK AND EAT THIS MOUTH-WATERING DISH". Tip - check in on Yelp and get 10% off weekend brunch!Tip # 2 - complimentary orange-cranberry muffins!' u"My work mates and I were looking for a great dining experience for our night out in the city but we were so overwhelmed by the choices. \xa0Thankfully we decided to go to Hourglass Tavern!At first we thought is was going to be a long wait but we were sent to the third floor where we found a quaint 8-10 table dining room and were seated immediately. \xa0We were told the soup of the day was homemade chicken noodle. \xa0My two co-workers each ordered the soup and I am still kicking myself for not ordering it too (I was allowed to taste one of there's). \xa0I ordered the Hourglass salad instead and even though I would have loved the soup my salad was the perfect balance of greens and toppings. \xa0It was so fresh and delicious!The highlight of the night though was meeting the owner Beth and being able to see her rooftop garden. \xa0We had a great time hearing about the history of the restaurant and her passion to create something special for her diners. \xa0Our waiter Nkrame was also very charming and made us a signature drink called the Brooklyn Flower (it truly has floral notes!!). We have vowed to visit the Hourglass Tavern again when in NYC. \xa0It really is a special place." u"Have eaten dinner here as well as frequented the speakeasy type bar upstairs and love both. It's my go to whenever I'm meeting friends in the HK area. $7 mystery beer and mystery shot and $5 wine at happy hour. Dinner was very standard chicken breaths mashed potatoes and veg hearty no frills and a very reasonable price tag. Great service and the owner always remembers me whenever I come back. Love the ambiance but can get really crowded in both places quick. Recommended early arrival for happy hour seating." u"Pre-fixe pre-theatre dinner. \xa0Check! Hourglass is a super reasonably priced hotspot very close to theatres in a historical building. \xa0Place gets super packed on weekends so make sure to make reservations. \xa0Food is great and comes out pretty quickly which is key to getting the crowds out of the restaurant and to their shows timely. \xa0 \xa0The pre fixe comes with 3 courses and what's even better is you can upgrade any entr\xe9e in the menu!" u'Definitely underwhelmed. \xa0Came here with my mother before a Broadway show and both of us were not impressed. \xa0The service was great but the food was just okay.After seeing all of the positive reviews I really expected much much better.' u'UPDATEWe\'ve come back several times and really like coming here. The food is always good and although we don\'t remember her name the female waitress who works downstairs is always so sweet and accommodating. We\'ve recommended this place to several people and they\'ve all enjoyed coming here as well.Old review: I\'ve eaten here before and the food was pretty good but tonight we had a reservation for 4 people at 6:30. The man at the door was so off putting that we decided to go elsewhere. \xa0We show up at 6:20 and on our way in are "greeted" by a man who asks if he can help us. We had no idea he was working there and he wasn\'t helpful at all. Quite honestly he was a little bit creepy. The waitress inside asked us to wait at the bar upstairs until 6:30 and then come back down... Which I can understand but it seemed like there wouldn\'t have been a place to put us anyway. And we shouldn\'t have to come back down if we sit at your bar you should come get us when a table is ready.The next person to walk up was "greeted" by this man and she said: oh do you work here? His response: "sometimes". She asked: Are tables available? He says: well they\'re pretty full and no one is leaving. She asks: can we put our name down? His response: well I guess you could.Not sure who decided to put him at the door but he waits until you walk up and stands there and then asks if he can help but is really no help at all. Seems like he not even sure if where he is. We decided to leave because we felt uncomfortable.' u'Great little place in the heart of tourist town! Came here for brunch around noon in a party of 4 and they still had plenty of tables! The server was really great and attentive. I ordered the eggs and short rib hash. Prices here were great and brunch comes with complimentary drink and muffin. Portions were a perfect size. The short rib hash was fantastic and I would have eaten about 5 more portions of it if I could.Highly recommend this place and would definitely comes again!' u"Brunch menu is nice (the short rib hash did not disappoint) $5 brunch drink deals interior is large with nice ambiance and staff is super friendly. They also take reservations! Service was very slow even though the place seemed to at about half capacity. It took almost 2 hours for 2 of us to get in and out for brunch. We weren't in a hurry so we didn't mind but maybe skip this place if you're on a tighter schedule." u"what a gem of a find in HK! this is for bettie bar on the second floor above hourglass tavern. first $5 happy hour until 10pm love it! this covers white or red wine sangria and all of their bottled beers. Suggest coming here with only a few other ppl as it is small and obviously gets crowded with these types of deals! there was 4 of us total and we definitely lucked out and were able to grab some seats at the small bar as other patrons were leaving.the bartender was super friendly and engaging he was also playing some great thursday night spotify tunes (who doesn't like some random TLC jams?!). while we didnt get much food the hummus appetizer we did have was very delicious and tasted homemade. the meatballs we originally wanted to try were already SOLD OUT so will have to stop by again in order to try. the bartender said they were one of the tastiest items on the menu." u'Brunch was great! HG florentine and $5 mimosas. Love the place. Victorian home with 3 levels and each level comes with their own servers. Nkrumah was super nice and attentive. Thanks guys' u"Betti Bar review:If I could marry a bar and produce lots of little cocktail babies with it Betti Bar would be my partner for life 'til (alcohol-fueled) death do us part. Every visit is perfection. Every drink is perfection. Every bartender is perfection. And the best time to come (#doubleentrendre)? Halloween. The decorations are amazing like a slutty cheerleader that decided to go just a little sluttier for this special night. Come imbibe eye.Reasons to propose:- Always quiet (maybe because they can't seat more than 15 people)- Great music (runs the gamut from classic rock to swing to R&B and you can always make requests)- Well-behaved clientele (no meat market just trendy professionals who weren't raised in barns)- Happy hour deals (such as $5 sangrias wines by the glass and whatever creation they came up with that day)- Unpretentious service (every one is a friend here)We're just saving up for the ring right now." u"::Cue Beyonc\xe8 and Jay-Z On The Run melody:: Black Hourglass...Toast to clich\xe9 brunch in my dark past. This restaurant gives you the feel of the Roaring 20's. Classical jazz playing vintage building dark wood floors and saloon decor. A very small and intimate setting. Ideal for a brunch date or party with at most 4 people to a table. Hourglass is located amongst all the other restaurants on Restaurant Row in Hell's Kitchen. While researching Boozy Brunch restaurants in the Theater District H.G came highly recommended for their $5 cocktail menu and brunch options. Despite Winter Storm Jonas' plans to wipe out NYC with an Avalanche \xa0I purchased tickets to see The Color Purple nearby and had a 1:30p.m. show to make. I arrived at H.G at 11:00 a.m. The commute to Midtown went as planned. There was only waiter(Edgar) and the chef in the restaurant. The other staff members were still commuting. We were the 1st patrons to arrive and we're seated on the lower level beside the kitchen. Edgar was our waiter and he was exceptional. Very professional and catered to all the patrons needs being the ONLY waiter on staff. Blizzard Bites- Brunch Menu features an Entree complimentary coffee or Tea. The Brunch Menu also features $5 Happy Hour Cocktails (Peach/Mango Mimosas \xa0Palomas Screwdriver Sangria and Whiskey Cinnamon Coffee). A complimentary basket of warm FRESH Cranberry muffins are provided. These muffins are ADDICTING! \xa0They have the batter and soft texture of cake paired with a tart and tangy cranberry. So good we asked Edgar for more on the house. I \xa0ordered the Mango Mimosa and Sangria. The alcohol content was dense and the cocktail was well blended. I decided on the Florentine (poached eggs over fresh Foccacia bread with spinach Mixed Greens salad and Rib Hash). Everything I had was fresh. The vegetables were delicious. My poached eggs were perfection! \xa0The runny yoke paired with the soft Foccacia and Spinach was very pleasing to my palette. The Rib Hash was very tasty. The meal was a great mix of protein and vegetables to help power up for my day and to absorb my cocktails. By my 2nd drink I was seeing double on my way to the restroom. More patrons started to trickle into the restaurant as 12:00 approached. Many who had reservations. As the bottom floor filled the rest of the patrons were seated on the 2nd floor (Betti Bar). My best advice to you is to make a reservation and do not come in large groups. \xa0I Checked In with my Yelp Offer of 10% off the bill which deducted the Tax. Our bill was $23 PP. I will be back because I was fully satisfied with the quality of my meal and exceptional service. \xa0I will also be back to sample the Potato pancakes and smoked \xa0salmon."]
145.Rudy’s Bar & Grill,[u'My son and I spent pretty much every evening for a week at this place back in April when I took him to NYC for his first trip there as a "college graduation present" vacation. \xa0I had not been there in 20 years... and was SO GLAD to see it was still alive and kicking! \xa0GREAT PLACE! \xa0How can you go wrong with cheap drinks and free dogs??? \xa0 Looking forward to hitting the best dive bar in Manhattan again when I go back in September!' u"Unpopular opinion: I secretly hate happy hour because I'm always STARVING after work and I'd rather just a) go home and make dinner or b) go straight out to dinner. That being said Rudy's is great because you can have a drink but also have a [free] hot dog as a snack to hold you over until dinner. Yeah that's right. I said a hot dog is A SNACK. The crowd at this place is truly unbelievable--people from all walks of life were having a blast here. We had a group of about 15 for a friend's birthday but even without our large group crowding the end of the bar I would have still thought it was pretty busy. The drinks are cheap. Cash only type of place. We had a good time. PS- I ate the entire hot dog before taking a single sip of my beer #priorities" u"This place is casual and fun even if quite dark inside the atmosphere of the people that attend this bar is fun and enthusiastic. Service is super nice too. Secret: ask for a god dog especially if you've been out drinking they will give you a warm delicious and FREE hot dog! And with a smile! I've never been given free food with such kindness from bartenders." u"A legitimate dive bar in New York. The prices aren't too bad you can actually buy pitchers here too. Also they have a little hot dog roaster in case you need a bite. Hells Kitchen lost the reputation it had years ago and thats not a bad thing. This place is full of different characters but wasn't the type of place where my shorty was afraid to step outside for fear of gun fire (yes that has happened in SF and San \xa0Jose) at the end of the day go have a drink and a beer. you'll dig it.. shot n a beer was about $10. unlike Smiths or whatever that shit place was called that charged me $23 for a beer and a vodka neat." u"Rudy's is a very unusual bar. The People: The crowd ranges from sloppy 23-year-old graduates questionably under-aged students from the Bronx and motorcycle men. The Place: The decor involves a lot of happy piggies and booths made of red duct tape. The music is randomly selected from a jute box. There is a back room with tables full of smokers (I did not feel like I belonged in there). The Things: The drinks are probably the cheapest in Manhattan. There are free hot dogs. It is a great place to bring friends who cannot wrap their head around NYC prices. Rudy's is a cash-only bar run by a few happy older European men. It's is a very rowdy bar you will NOT be bringing your bumble date to. If you are not looking to check your Canadian Goose parka and sit around and drink $35 cocktails you cannot pronounce this is your place. Solid night." u"I will admit that I am torn with this bar. \xa0I love the dive bar feel. I love the cheap house beers served in pitchers. \xa0I love the back yard with its giant projected TV. \xa0You can easily walk in here with $20 and drink happily for a few hours with friends which is fantastic for the area. \xa0I was first drawn into the comforts of Rudy's piggy embrace a few years ago. \xa0I did not realize at the time that so many people knew and loved it. \xa0Unevenly padded and duct tape booths surly bouncer even surlier bartenders. \xa0Once grabbing their attention I grab (even to this day) one of their house drafts in either pint or pitcher form. \xa0They also offer fairly cheap shots which will help you deal with the general stickiness of all those who occupied the booth before you arrived. \xa0Now the big draw has and will forever be the complimentary hot dogs with drink purchase. \xa0While I am not into hot dogs almost every single human I know loves them and cherishes these tube shaped gifts as if they had never had food before. \xa0They just need to pad the stomach with something cheap dirty and salty at the end of a long night. To be completely honest I am there for the booze deals.I always enjoy the company of the friends I find myself here with and the cold beer that fills my glass. Yet I cannot seem to find the deep love that most of my friends feel for this bar. \xa0Since it is located in a super touristy part of town it can be packed especially in the summer. \xa0Yes its bar is lined usually lined with regulars but there's also the chance of being surrounded by irritating college kids looking to score a free dawg or taking a picture with the figurehead of the bar Rudy himself. If I had the choice I'd rather spend my time in a dive downtown. \xa0However if I am in the area on a random tuesday it is nice to visit. If I have cash handy that is." u"Where else can you drink a $12 pitcher of Bud Light on a back patio in Midtown West? You can even get an $8 pitcher of house beer if you're feeling adventurous. There is always a pretty vibrant crowd inside if you can get past the creepy pig mascot out front.Disclaimer: I've never been here after 3pm" u'A relaxing dive bar near the theater district with friendly service great conversation and an inexpensive menu. \xa0It was just what I was looking for to relax for a few minutes before a show. \xa0The bartender gave me great tips on local restaurants.' u"What a great find! Stopped in for cold beer after sightseeing in the 95f heat . It's a local joint  chatted with very nice locals . Sorry that Sir Swine was in rehab would have loved a photo with him! Cold beer  great prices nice crowd  our kind of bar !" u"Divvy and fun on Fri-nights. I'd go back with a smaller group as it was a bit crowded when we went. Good times to be had here for sure!" u'This place is hopping packed crazy and fun......look up dive bar in the dictionary and their picture may be there. \xa0Loved it Loved dive bars because the people are real. Free hot dog on check in so what more could you ask for with your beer. \xa0Drinks are very reasonable. \xa0Some tables and bar seats for this smallish NYC bar and wow can they pack them in. \xa0Friendly people and lots of regulars. This was #4 on our bar crawl......girls night and we stayed longer here than we did some of the other places we traveled to. \xa0Fun Girls night out!' u"These five stars aren't fancy five stars.They are dive bar five stars.They are free hot dog five stars.They are super friendly bouncer (danny) and bartender stars.They are most affordable drinks in Manhattan stars.They are stars well deserved. If in the area check this place out. You may have to squeeze in for a spot but it's worth it. \xa0And make sure you get a free dog. \xa0It's better than Papaya Dog down the street (IMO) and those are $2.50.Thank you Rudy's for making me love NY from our first night there." u'How much do I love dives? Let me count the ways.Meandering through the bustling streets of NYC one tends to build up not only a thirst and as for " This Guy" \xa0a hunger. Now what if you could satisfy both needs in one swoop into a watering hole on the cheap. In this city really? Well say hello to Rudy\'s. Home of the free hot dog baby.The idea of free or cheap anything in this city seems almost mythical or definitely from days gone by. Nope. $3 draft specials of their home brew including shots to accompany your free dog. Unlike my good buddy fellow elite Yelper CK who happens to be an amateur sword swallower I tend to take my time downing said free doggie dog. This ain\'t the coney island hot dog race so embrace the free nourishment not as if it were your last but your 1st. Yes that\'s right take a little bite and smile up to the beholder "oh thank you for this dog that I\'m about to consume" after each and every bite heads down the proverbial hatch. I\'m typically good for 3 on an average day maybe 6 if I\'m out to prove a point ( not too sure what the point is but free dogs rock all the same ).Now to the clientele. As a whole it\'s a \xa0semi-blue collar-yuppy-millenial-construction worker haven ( I always throw my tie in my back pack before my grand entrance as not to spill in the typically cramped surroundings.). Tonight 3 fingered bearded and hairy as all hell dude from Amsterdam \xa0" Marco" became my drinking palsy walsy. Oh Marco spun a web of oceanic crossing and sword fighting only to land in the Florida keys. Yes he found the keys to a weekend house stole their money and took a bus to NYC ending up here in Rudy\'s where we embrace all swashbucklers as if they were a long lost cousin that just happens to be a bit hairy and too ripe. Nevertheless Marco and I became friends for just a day and yes I\'d give it all away for love. Not really but it sure adds to the story doesn\'t it?So as you\'d expect the surroundings are a bit grungy. The bathrooms not sure they actually have any but they must so yes they have them. Get the point.So of course they had me at cheap draft and FREE dogs. But that\'s where this story begins the ending is up to you to create for yourself.' u'I mean I\'m a vegetarian so the whole "free hot dog with a drink purchase" thing is only useful if there\'s a homeless guy nearby & I can pay it forward. \xa03 stars cause I mean c\'mon can a girl at least get some fries?But! \xa0Undoubtedly one of the cheapest places to grab a beer in all of NYC. \xa0The interior reminds me of a hole-in-the-wall bar that I\'d find back in smalltown PA where I grew up but maybe I found it endearing for that? \xa0Either way if I can get a $5 Stella I\'m happy!And I mean c\'mon guys you NEED a picture with the pig.' u'Yes is true there is a bar that you can get drunk and fill your hunger at the same time and price.I remember coming here a long time ago with a friend before starting using yelp and a few day a go Me and 2 friends we decided to come here again.Bottled beers drafts beers and pitcher are decent and prices are super cheap and every drink comes with a free hot dog. That makes it perfect.It has a patio in the back that is open in the summer.Although the seats are not very good and comfortable the place is good to come drink eat have a great time with a couple friends and watch a good game.' u'5 Stars automatically for the service and beer. Cold beers warm hot dogs and cheap prices?4 Stars for the asinine door man and lack of room to do/go anywhere. Just grab that pitcher and hold on tight...' u"My wife and I went here back in April. What a wonderful find! If you can make it during a Sunday afternoon even better! Lots of great locals hang out here. You might even be lucky enough to meet Pat. He's a terrific patron. Very cheap and in the middle of NYC. The Rudy's Blonde is good and dirt cheap." u'Affordable and clean. Not all that big so it can get crowded. I plan on going back. Got two beers a shot and a (free) hot dog for only $10.UPDATE: Have gone back a few more times still a solid joint. Took a visiting friend here.' u"Comfortable and characteristic bar to stop for a quick drink or two. Great selection of draft beer (Goose IPA is recommended) and they are also know for their hotdogs (though I didn't try these). Located in Hells Kitchen so easy to reach and lots going on in the area." u"Best drink deal in town!Cheap beer free hot dogs (delicious) and friendly atmosphere.If you're in Manhattan stop in!"]
193.Mickey Spillane’s,[u'Great place to people watch on a nice day !!!Friendly cute staffPerfect $5 Frozen Margueritas on a hot day ! Avacado and tomato bruschetta!! \xa0Yum Nice way to end the week' u"My daughter got sick after eating the eggs here so not happy!We should have known it would be average as there was only one other party and it was brunch time on a Saturday.The waitress was very nice and the food came quickly but it was very oily. \xa0Coffee was 5 x stronger than it needed to be and none of us could finish it.It has nice decor and a fun facade outside.I won't be coming back here when I am in New York next time." u"I came here for a cold beer while I wait for a friend bartender was more interested in a conversation w a friend than collect $ and get orders going.Beer was meh glass wasn't even cold and the service was like a wet dish rag.I work my drink to the patio and sat down fora minute when a waiter pulls me saying this is for another couple.Go here if you want overhyped atmosphere meh beer and staff that expects a tip for a when they hand you the menu with a scowl.Are you ready to order yet?I'll order dinner elsewhere tonight somewhere with better food; Where is the nearest Tacobell?" u"After my obnoxious experience with Blockheads (just reviewed them) we went to Mickey Spillane's. \xa0I can't walk past a sign advertising a $5 frozen margarita and not go in. \xa0Typical bar food nothing amazing nothing awful. \xa0The margarita was good - small but good (what does one expect for five bucks). \xa0The service ... well. \xa0I finished my drink and was never asked if I wanted another. \xa0Never got napkins despite ordering finger-foods. \xa0The waiter was too busy flirting with younger skinnier boys to notice we were waiting to pay the bill. \xa0I get it - it's a hard job. \xa0It's a job I never want to have. \xa0We still tipped the server 20 % because I can't be THAT guy - just know that it's nice to be nice to people you don't want to sleep with either." u'Really great place to pregame and just hang out before going out-out. $4 drinks including some beers basic drinks and shots and $5 frozen margaritas!' u"The food was good a bit overpriced but the service was TERRIBLE! Our server took our orders then we literally never saw him again. About 15 minutes after ordering and not receiving our drinks (during which other people were seated and got their drinks and the bartender helped everyone at the bar and made himself two waters) I went up and inquired about our drinks; sure enough the receipt was just sitting there on a tray with an empty glass ready to be made but just being ignored. I went back to our table then another server that had been at the bar when I asked about our drinks came up and asked if we wanted to order food (which we already had). He then said that they were waiting for our food to bring our drinks; this was not true as 1) other tables had been getting their drinks 2) he had just asked us if we wanted to order food so how could they be waiting on food they thought we hadn't ordered yet? Just the worst service; if you want drinks go directly to the bar then go elsewhere for food" u"So I came here to grab a drink and a bite to eat with friends on Friday night. I must say don't come here for food. If it wasn't for the bartender Brittany being so chill communicative and attentive I would give this place a solid 1 star.I ordered the buffalo chicken nachos and BBQ chicken pita pockets. Buffalo Chicken Nachos:ProsThey look amazingVery spicy which I loveToppings were greatConsVery SaltyIF YOU'RE OKAY WITH SALTY GIVE IT A SHOT BBQ Chicken Pita Pockets: ProsNoneConsNot enough pockets for the cost Taste like something you can order from Wendy's DO NOT ORDERI also had a frozen margarita. You'll get what you pay for. Go down the street to blockheads for better margaritas." u"I've been here before but I think I forgot to write a review but this place has these 5 dollar frozen margaritas that are awesome. \xa0The staff is super friendly and they make sure that they take care of you and ask you if you need refills etc.I would come back to check out other deals and their food as well." u"3 Stars just for the frozen margarita's which really sounds like is the best thing here. I ordered the Land Shark beer on tap.. which did not taste like Land Shark at all. It was definitely a pint of the Budweiser that was offered to me.Service wise it's quite OK and this place was relatively empty on a Sunday afternoon at 1:10 pm." u'Decent Bar to get a few drinks. Plus they have $5 Frozen Margarita\'s cant go wrong with that. My only complaint We ordered Nacho\'s and Cheese and waited for 50 min before cancelling the order and walking out. I mean its F\'g Nacho\'s and Cheese my 6 yr old Nephew cant get it done in 15 mins. I get it you are busy but ITS NACHOS AND CHEESE if you cant sever that in 50 mins DON\'T PUT IT ON THE MENU OHHH BTW THEY HAVE LIKE 5 THINGS ON THE MENU. The only response I got form the server when asked "Its Coming..." Go here if you want some Cheap Margarita that is the only upside I see here.' u'What\'s better than $5 frozen margaritas and buffalo chicken nachos for under $15 which is easily shared between 3 people? How about really awesome service the whole night???I love this place because whenever I\'m in Hell\'s Kitchen and need something "bad for me to eat" or just want to continue the party I always come here. The music is great the atmosphere is fun and the food is so tasty whether you\'re drinking or not.However I wanted to write this review because me two best friends and I came here last night and had a waiter named Sean. He was the whole reason why we had fun...he was SO fun and was a really great waiter as well. He just had such a good vibe about him and he made sure that me and my friends were taken care of in a timely fashion and made sure we were having a good time. So kudos to Sean because he was one of the best waiters I\'ve ever had. He will be the reason why I keep coming back here!' u"My friend and I found ourselves here to pass the time while waiting for a table at a neighboring restaurant. We were looking for a bar close by with good happy hour deals and saw their sign outside for $5 margaritas. The first thing I noticed upon sitting down was that the seat was really sticky and full of crumbs. I was rather put off by that but it was fine since I knew we were not gonna be there for long anyway. It would have been nice if they could have cleaned or wiped down the seats after the previous party left.. Especially since it's really dark inside and you can't make sure that the seats are crumb-free before sitting down. (Not like anyone should have to check their seats for crumbs or other spillage at a decent restaurant..) The $5 margarita special was only for the original flavor. If you wanted the other flavors (and they have a lot - apple strawberry blueberry etc.. I can't remember the whole range) it'd cost you $6. The drinks came in small plastic cups and I was disappointed that they were very weak! There are other bars around the city with cheaper happy hour margaritas that pack more punch. When we asked for the check we realized that they had put another table's drinks on our check in addition to ours. Considering that the bar was really empty and there were literally only 3 tables occupied it was a mistake that should not even have been made.The saving grace of this bar was definitely the friendly waitress. Very happy joked with me and my friend and was very pleasant and helpful! Having said that I don't think I'll be back here again." u'DISCLAIMER: LONG REVIEW BELOW!I\'m really giving this place a zero but clearly that is not an option. Friday (10/19) my co-workers and I went back for the 4th time we decided to make it our spot on Friday\'s since we had such a great time with the staff and the happy hour runs until 9pm. We had 3 rounds each and ordered food.When the bill came and my female co-worker and I both notice that we were charge 4 drinks each instead of 3. When we bring this to the attention of one of the several servers that served us for the night he immediately gets defensive and doesn\'t try to help the situation at all. He then brings over his manager. The SECOND she came to the table she was rude and didn\'t even try to listen to what we were explaining She immediately went into "how we did this before" and was completely disrespectful and accusatory. COMPLETELY UNTRUE. Had we done this before try to dispute drink orders why allow us back in and never confront us about it. In addition to even conversing and sitting at our tables while they worked....By this time I had had enough of her so I asked for the owner and asked the 3 waiters if they had this issue with us before they all said NO but would not say it in front of her. At this point its not even about the additional added drinks but the fact that you are blindly accusing us of scheming on the bill. I had even gone to the bouncer to confirm this and he admitted that the last two Friday\'s that we were there we had a great time and left without any sort of dispute SHIT I even had shots with the staff two Friday\'s ago!! When the owner came out looking like a complete coked up jackass I explained to him the situation He proceeded to say that the system that they are using doesn\'t allow for mistakes.... I used to bartend and an aloha system is touch screen and can definitely ALLOW for an honest double tapped mistake. Especially when you have SEVERAL servers serving one table and they don\'t even keep tabs on the last order made by their co-worker. Like Carl G\'s review the owner proceeded to curse me out and continued to be a complete jerk-off. The staff really aren\'t bad in fact they were the reason we returned so many times. Its the manager and owner that screw this place up. The food isn\'t good either but this isn\'t the place to eat. Instead of remedying the situation and allowing either parties to admit a mistake be it us or them the management made the situation worse which completely blows my mind. I\'m sharing this post on FB just so more ppl can see how backwards management is and so that ppl know to tally mark their drinks before the owner/manager curses you out.' u"We wanted to drink just one beer and on our way to the hotel it was the first bar. I'm glad that we wanted to drink just ONE beer... 9$ for a Spaten Lager wtf?! In a restaurant we had been before we were eating a 3-course menu for about 18$ - compare that! Our impression was that it might be a gay bar." u'My two friends and I attended this place and let me tell you: what a bunch of jerks the staff are. My friend ordered a drink and he was immediately treated as hostile. We were so confused. The bartender continued to berate my friend even when my friend was focused on our conversation. Naturally we opted not to tip. "I don\'t need your $4 dollars anyhow. You know I can have you thrown out of here" says the bartender. We HAPPILY left and never plan to return. If you like nice people don\'t go here.' u"Stopped in after midnight on a Sunday (now Monday) night asking if the kitchen was open. Nice guy at the door said they're open until 3am. Since I live in the 'hood this was good to know. Sat at the bar Elene (sp?) was the bartender. Had a couple of drinks and the smoked brisket sandwich. All was good. Will definitely come back. Nice friendly staff." u"On this first hot day of the year I was looking forward to nothing more than enjoying a cold drink with outdoor seating. Unfortunately I came to Mickey Spillane's where my boyfriends coke tasted like seltzer water the first time and the second time after we told the non friendly waitstaff. Speaking of which he then managed to tell us we couldn't bring in outdoor drinks (since we had to get a coke from the deli across the street). We were never offered water or were asked if we needed anything when I really needed some mayo and ketchup for the driest brisket sandwich I've ever had. In conclusion I didn't eat the sandwich my boyfriend wasn't allowed to drink anything. And the only time the waiters came was to deliver the check. AND as I'm writing this review across the street the waiter manages to chase us down the street and ask why we didn't tip. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE ESPECIALLY OF YOU'RE THIRSTY ON A HOT DAY." u'"Gay? Straight? Who cares?!! This place is great"As soon as you step foot into this place you greeted by the wonderful staff in a part of town that is know for both good and bad attitude. We were even allowed to sit outside just to have only drinks. We came here for a drink or two so I cannot comment on the food. But the margarita was delicious and strong. Plus the waiter was cool with me modifying my margarita order since I am not a fan of very sweet drinks. For example one of the margaritas has triple sec and sour mix. Our bill was a little higher than expected because there was a little confusion over which drinks were on the happy hour menu so we paid 12 bucks instead of the 5 dollar happy hour price for our drinks. But that could have been due to a misunderstanding on our part. I will be returning to this place.' u'From the moment you walk into this fabulous NYC bar you are greeted by friendly staff and if you are lucky enough you might also meet Ritchie the owner and personality behind this brilliant brand.Great food great service fantastic vibe. I have been in there twice during this NYC visit and I will be back of course! We loved their guacamole and chips (most delish I have had in the city) the group of 10 people we were with loved the chicken salad the tomato and mozzerella cheese and everyone loved the vibe.Do yourself a favor and check out this great spot. Thanks Ritchie for making us feel so welcome and looking after us so well.' u'The chef needs to learn what a Croque Monsieur is before attempting to make one! What I was served was a couple of pieces of floppy damp lukewarm bread with a bit of cheese and ham on it. I was there with a French friend who warned me "it won\'t be good" when I was choosing from the menu but I had confidence that a popular bar in Hell\'s Kitchen would make a decent stab at creating this pretty simple dish. How wrong I was! I think this is the first time I\'ve ever sent food back without even trying it.The BBQ pulled-chicken mini-pitas that I got instead were "ok" but far too sweet. Less BBQ sauce more chicken please.The waitress was pleasant-enough though.Unlikely that I\'d ever go back.']
43.Kellogg’s NYC,[u'I love cereal. Who doesn\'t? I just couldn\'t pass off the offer of stopping by this cereal haven that has been all the hype this summer. An important thing to note that I saw on a sign walking in was that this place only accepts credit card. So make sure you\'re ready before going in as they do not accept cash. The decor of this shop is absolutely on par with the aesthetics of its cereal! I love how I was able to customize my own bowl while also having the option to choose a preset bowl. The shop offers pretty much all the types of Kellogg\'s cereal you can possibly ask for. There are also various choices for toppings that are worth trying out! My cereal also came with a small surprise - a temporary tattoo of "Kellogg\'s NYC" that was really cute. Overall - this place is a 5/5 for me. The experience of tasting freshly arranged cereal with local Brooklyn milk in an aesthetically pleasing shop definitely made this place worth the visit. A bit on the pricey side but where else can you find a cereal-tasting experience like this?' u"A+ concept. Deep down inside we always knew that cereal could be eaten any time of the day. We were just waiting for somebody to solidify this concept and Kellogg's does it! C- pricing. $11 for a regular sundae bowl. I got the green tea berry and it is quite obvious that the ingredients don't add up to this price. Strawberries were more on the sour side and their vanilla blue marble ice-cream comes out already semi melted. Your best bet is to go to red mango and get something just as similar for half the price. The only downside is that you don't have all the types of cereal that they offer here. Overall it's nice to come here just to try it out because of its sparkling white interior cute red doors leading you to your purchased bowl within & everything you wanted in your childhood and adulthood come to fruition. ** Credit cards only!" u'There is always something new popping up in NYC. A recent newcomer also called one of the "weirdest" opening of this Summer (2016) is the Kellogg\'s NYC. I always loved cereal especially Kellogg\'s cereals. So we decided to check them out. It sits in the heart of Times Square great location for getting lots of curious customers.I liked the simple retro and clean designs. Most of everything was black and white with pop of red color. The seating area was kind of small around 16 - 18 seats. But since this is more of a quick snack & dessert place the turn around is pretty quick. If there is no seat available or if you are in a hurry there was a bar area at the back. It is a tall standing counter so there is no bar stool. This spot is good for those customers who are looking for a quick snack or not interested in eating but just want a quick cup of coffee or tea which they do offer here.After we made the order we were given a buzzer that corresponds to a number on the bright red cabinet door. When the buzzer went off I went to open the door with our number and there they were our cereal creations waiting in the inside. There was no tray to carry them which was not considerate...Yes the price is high when you think of is as "cereal bowl" with a twist. I can imagine people thinking they can buy a whole box of cereal for less than $6.50. But then again most of food and drinks we get outside - coffee beer pasta sandwich...etc. - are more expensive at restaurants and bars. What you are paying for is the experience just as you get from going out for a dinner or drinks. Whether this is an experience you want to repeat or just one-time experience is enough...that is up to each customer.No Bathroom and Credit Card Only. Read my full review of this restaurant and food on my food blog foodlovergirl.' u"If I could eat cereal every day all day..I would. So maybe my review is biased. This place is awesome! I would suggest going with one of their recipes (Corny Blues was amazing)but you can custom create you're own. Staff is friendly. The presentation is unique (you go to your own cabinet to get your cereal out - like at home :) and it comes with a little Kellogg's prize. Can't wait to go back and try a sundae" u'If you are looking to have a quick breakfast interesting snack or even a quirky dessert then Kelloggs Cereal Bar is the perfect place for you! I understand "it\'s just cereal" but honestly I was thoroughly but the amount of fruit mix-ins varieties of cereal and milk this place had to offer. While trying to decide on what to eat I took a seat at the counter for a few minutes to make up my mind. I decided to go with a somewhat slightly healthy cereal because it was still morning time and I wanted to start my day somewhat off right before ruining my diet. I decided on Special K strawberries bananas malt powder and almond butter. For the milk I choose non-fat. A few minutes later my order appeared in the window waiting for me. I was impressed with the presentation and the cool temperature of the milk so much that I quickly devoured my bowl. I left absolutely nothing behind! When I visit New York again this place will definitely be on my radar! I loved it so much that I will definitely be trying an ice cream cereal bowl next time!' u'Fun idea. Mix up cereals with ice cream or your regular milk. Small and clean. They seem very over staffed but maybe because it is new and only the manager really knows how it all works. Interesting idea and fun to try once. Just once though.' u"This place rocks.Any place that serves legit easy delicious Kellogg's cereal is good in my book. And Kellogg's NYC makes it FUN to enjoy your cereal.It's a bit hidden amongst other flashy places but it's not crowded once you make it in. Since they're new I don't expect they'll be this way for long but it's so refreshing after fighting my tourist crowds to get here.My favorite thing to get? Some 'plain jane' Frosted Flakes cereal. It reminds me of the way my mama 'made' it for me when I was a kid. Whole milk from local farms makes it THAT much better.Dress your cereal up or keep it plain add a small bit of fun with fruit and toppings or go all out with sugar on sugar on sugar.The choice is yours my friends. Choose wisely!" u"Ya Ya I know it's only cereal what's the big deal right? Well for starters they do it right!!!They got 14 plus different Kellogg's brands to choose from with 30 plus kinds of fruit nuts and candy topping you can have it with whole skim soy milk or yogurt and ice creamFrom the manager on down to the staff are super friendly helpful and cool. You go the the counter to put in your order 'CREDIT CARDS ONLY' no cash. They give you a beeper and wait for it to buzz and go to the door it flashes to pick up your order. Now for cereal the prices are steep a small bowl starts at $3.50 with milk and no topping so you could end up paying $7.50 or more depending what you add on it.I got those n variety packs with 5 or 6 different brands and most of the time my favorites are gone and I'm lucky if I got a banana to slice to have with it. \xa0Here I got Strawberries Blueberries and Marshmallows too with some real cold milk and it was all fresh. And they gave me a bubble gum prize too. ;-)Know I wouldn't be coming here all the time but I know when I want to get a fresh fruit multi-topping cereal treat where to go. And they also have sundaes too which I have not yet tried." u"Super cute place !Stopped here on the way to work after reading the other reviews. It is what it is:CEREAL yes. BUT it's thought out on the other ingredients they mix with it. Creative and fun ! You pick up your food in a locker... I was soo excited and honestly probably grinning walking up to it. I got the pistachios and Lemon as well as the Life in Color with Milk instead of ice cream. Both cereals were really tasty! Who knew lemon zest would make me whoo !BTW to the owner your marshmallows are super fresh and I hope you keep up with that....nothing worse than a stale mallow in your cereal !I wish I had kiddos to bring here too. Super cute place ill be back!!" u'Now grant you I was skeptical about it at first and did take about week before giving in and agree on coming here. But seeing the excitement on my friend\'s face after he found out Kellogg\'s was opening I knew I\'d have to give this place a try. Upon walking in we were greeted by a friendly staff who handed us the menu. While standing in line I followed my nose and decided on the option to "raid the pantry". I went with the Frosted Mini - Wheats Chocolate (starting at $4.5 Reg/ $3.5 Small) and some add ons ($1.5 for each item). I chose Banana + Green Tea Powder as some add ons for my cereal. Not too sweet (I don\'t like anything to sweet) had the right amount of crunch and the best part was that the green tea powder turned into matcha milk (I love everything matcha). The combination sound so simple but it was so good!The staff were really nice and genuine the reason why I give 5 stars and not 4. A bowl of cereal here may cost as much as lunch but the ability get out of the comfort zone to experience something old (and something new) there\'s nothing like it.' u"These pop-ups are always fun to go to and more of an experience than anything so that's exactly what I expected and got from this place. It's essentially a cereal bar that you can either make yourself (what my friend and I did) or you can pick one form their menu.You can get regular cereal & milk OR get cereal & ice cream (they call it a sundae) which we thought sounded more delicious so we ordered that. We were right! With recommendations from the extremely friendly staff working here we ordered our sundaes and waited only about 5 or so minutes until our buzzer went off.Once the buzzer goes off they put your cereal behind one the red doors and you open it up (which is a really cute way of serving your food!) and take it back to your table to enjoy! I got a big kick out of this and it's a very cute photo-op (if you're into that kind of thing).I'd definitely go to it while it's here -- don't be put off by how it's in Times Square of course it's kinda touristy but it's good! It IS overpriced which is the only reason I bumped it down a star so be wary of that. We had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon so we were fine but just a heads up! Still would highly recommend!" u"Yes it is mostly just cereal that most people will complain is too expensive but it is in the middle of Times Square so it could be worse.For something different and harder to make by yourself at home try one of the delicious sundaes made with Blue Marble Soft Serve. The Life In Color is definitely the most instagrammable but the You're Cracklin' Me Up is also great ($8.50).This is actually more than just a cereal bar it's now one of the better options for frozen dessert around here." u'I love love loved the idea of this place! I nice little breakfast place perfect for even lunch and dinner. Although it was just cereal in a bowl I was super excited about it! Would definitely go back here' u"I know I know. I came here mostly for the grams but it was well worth the try! I made my own custom bowl small All-Bran cereal with raspberry blueberry matcha powder and lemon zest. The milk was good. Not the watery texture that you get in some places and when the matcha melts voila a matcha latte! The staff were very friendly and the store was pretty spacious on a Saturday afternoon. Probably leaning towards the pricey side for a ~$5 to $7 bowl of cereal depending on what you add on but hey the pics are insta-worthy. I'll probably be back next time to try their yogurt or other toppings!" u"Buy one get one free opening special here. The cereals with yogurt were what you'd expect: crunchy with some yogurt at the bottom. They could've used more yogurt as the cereal to yogurt ratio was too high. Good snack place.Food:Crack me up: delish but could've used more yogurt Lemony one with pistachio: good" u"Yes. I tried it. I gave into the hype and made my way down to Kellogg's cereal bar and you know what? I loved it! It's cute the cereal is awesome and you even have the option of cereal sundaes which I totally have to try on my next visit.The staff are very helpful and friendly with suggestions information about the more popular items on the menu and how we can go about building our own bowl. FYI apparently this place is a hit with the after broadway show crowd!We got our cereal to go (they package it very nicely and the milk is in a bottle for later pouring) and everything was perfect when we got home. Hey it's cereal in Times Square. You can't go wrong with cereal. Are people actually complaining about the price? Smh. Stay home and pour yourself a bowl for free or pay for the Times Square experience. It's a relatively free country people!!!" u"I have to admit Kellogg's was not on my list of establishments to visit even though I'd heard of their upcoming opening. But I ended up checking it out anyway now that they've opened with my sis and her kids - and am glad I did. We tried two cereal bowls. I probably would've liked them both if we had gotten them with ice cream or even whole milk but we chose skim milk which I know I know changes the experience. The skim milk didn't stop me from tasting the flavor of the cereal though creatively combined with interesting toppings. Didn't fall in love with the cereal bowls but I did prefer the Corny Blues over the Pistachio + Lemon. Actually didn't really like the latter - personally I didn't think the thyme went well with the other flavors (sourness from lemon zest \xa0sweetness from cereal and nutty from pistachios)PISTACHIO + LEM\u0141ONSpecial K Original Frosted Flakes Pistachios Lemon Zest ThymeOdd combination - \xa0not sure what to make of this. THE CORNY BLUESCorn Pops Blueberry Jam Lemon Zest Kosher SaltThe ice cream is really good. I think everyone should get the cereal with ice cream. We tried the following sundaes:LIFE IN COLORFroot Loops Lime Zest Marshmallows Passion Fruit JamPEPPERMINT PATTYFrosted Mini-Wheats Chocolate Cocoa Powder Fresh MintYOU'RE CRACKLIN' ME UPCracklin' Oat Bran Dried Cranberries White Chocolate Toasted CoconutThe winner (our #1 favorite) was the YOU'RE CRACKLIN' ME UP probably bc of the healthy grain flavor but we also love almost anything with coconut (which is not overpowering). Close 2nd was the LIFE IN COLOR. Surprisingly I wasn't a fan of Fruit Loops but I did really like it with the marshmallows and jam. The PEPPERMINT PATTY was just ok. The cocoa powder kept scratching my throat and I choked with almost every bite I took. Did not enjoy...The room in the back is basically a bathroom but says Employees Only. Staff told us originally to go to a bathroom across the street but they made an exception when they knew it was the 4yo. Nice of them but strange that a food establishment with that much real estate and dining section doesn't offer bathroom to all customers." u"Christina Tosi (of Milkbar fame) and Andrew Rudolf (of Per Se fame) recently opened this little slice of heaven.The concept here is Kellogg's cereals with newfangled creations from Christina. Pick your pleasure: do you want Rice Krispies with strawberries and green tea powder. Frosted Mini Wheats with raspberries and ground coffee Corn Pops with blueberry jam lemon and salt? All of that is served with a jug of Five Acre Farms Milk. Concerned about your inability to digest dairy? Don't sweat they have soy for $1 extra. Maybe you want something a little bit crazier in which case you want a dessertier option. The Life in Color was thebomb.com. Froot Loops lime zest marshmallows passion fruit jam served with Blue Marble soft serve ice cream. Unreal! The Peppermint Patty with chocolate Mini Wheats cocoa powder and fresh mint was also divine. Or for the adventurous ones you can customize your own bowl with all the different Kellogg's cereals fruit nuts and toppings.After you place your order you're given a buzzer. When your food is ready a number is displayed on the buzzer. You go to the red lockers and open the one that corresponds to the number on your buzzer (a deacon is there to assist). Plenty of cute seating too. The staff is beyond friendly. Special shout out to today's deacon who was the friendliest nicest and funniest! What are you waiting for? This place is serially good (see what I did there?)." u"I've literally been dreaming of a cereal bar since my college days. And Kellogg Cafe lives up to the dream! Simply put it's cereal (or Blue Marble Soft Serve) with a bunch of unique toppings. But what takes it over the top is the experience. From the buzzer and kitschy automat feel of the cubbies to the beautiful presentation of the cereal and Five Acre Farms milk and the occasional little extra they throw in (a NY Times when I was there for breakfast in a business suit) it's quite the experience. \xa0Go in the morning and there's hardly a line. Five stars for a unique and fabulous experience! *****" u"If you're looking for something healthy and wholesome look elsewhere. \xa0There really isn't anything on the menu that I normally eat since i prefer savory stuff. It's all just sugar loaded on top of more sugar. For what it is it is entertaining and the combinations of cereal and soft serve ice cream were delicious. I think that sharing a small bowl between two or three people is enough since it's too sweet. \xa0I'm too old to be eating like this. Cereal on top of ice cream topped with marshmallow and even more sugar will cure anybody's sweet tooth. I feel like they should have the bar be diy. Seems like it would be more fun for people to go nuts with whatever combinations they can see rather than having a chef designed creation."]
69.The Jolly Monk,[u'This serene-at appropriate times- lively bar is close to the E train/Times Square but far enough that I do not have to deal with crowds. I have been here twice. I was in the area searching for a down to earth bar with drink specials that ran till 9/10pm. I ordered a few house wines and their spinach dip. The dip was delicious though the chips are oily. The wines are also strong a decent amount and cheap. My buddy ordered beers and mixed drinks.' u'with so many other choices in the area i\'ll likely not be back but overall it was a decent place. \xa0the food was decent and the service was good but not great. \xa0on the plus side the beer list is great and the atmosphere is fun. \xa0square bar with (if i recall correctly) seating on three sides. \xa0traditional square wooden stools with padded seat and back support. \xa0probably around 20 or more of them so it\'s relatively easy to grab a seat at the bar. \xa0great wooden bar top with it\'s natural imperfections. \xa0a round foot rest. \xa0 since the bar is square the bar back is nothing special however it does play up the "jolly" theme and has a few TVs (also TVs on other walls). \xa0red tiled ceiling above the bar area. \xa0surrounding the bar are several high top tables and windows that look out to 9th st. \xa0not a destination but worth a stop.' u"I went here for dinner with a friend to grab a late bite to eat on a Monday night. There was a decent crowd but we were able to be seated right away.For my meal I decided to get their famous Monk burger with a side salad and a Magners. The burger itself was cooked alright but I did not get much flavor from any of the ingredients that they added-resulting in the burger being pretty bland.Overall this place seems like a great place to grab a drink and watch a sports game but does not hit high marks on the food scale. While our waitress was pretty attentive she wasn't particularly friendly or warm." u"On to the next. I was in HK and had some time to kill before meeting someone. On the outside this place looks very inviting so I invited myself inside to grab a glass or two of wine. The place was relatively empty aside from about 7-10 people TOPS dispersed throughout the bar. I believe that I sat at the bar for at least 5 minutes before the bartender (a blond female) saw me but finished her conversation with someone else \xa0then asked if I wanted anything. I asked for a wine list she gave it to mean and left for another 3-4 minutes to participate in another couple's conversation. I ordered and received my drink which was fine. However it was weird that I had to prompt her for another drink (perhaps I am being a little sensitive). MOST bars that I visit typically the bartender will ask you if you want another beverage as you are finishing. Maybe I was supposed to scream across the bar whistle or ring a bell for my refill of wine. I probably will not be back but I will say that the menu of bar/pub food looked pretty kick ass." u"Ahh The Jolly Monk stumbled upon this place while walking the streets of Hell's Kitchen with my better half. We were so undecided on where to grab a bite. Whipped out my trusty Yelp App with its many options to choose from and a grumbling stomach. \xa0After searching through reviews of establishments within the area The Jolly Monk stood out amongst all the rest.As you enter there is a huge center bar with table seating that encircles the entire area. We were greeted by hostess and seated promptly at an intimate table behind the bar. We arrived in the middle of happy hour and found a buzzing crowd of suits and tourist types. We took a peek at the menu and decided on the BBQ chicken wings as a starter (Half-Dozen $10). What are wings without bleu cheese dipping sauce? Nothing like a good Bleu cheese to dip all over your BBQ chicken wings galore. These wings were a decent size and smothered with BBQ sauce; much better than the usual pub grub. Who doesn't order wings on a Friday night of shenanigans anyway?Since we were pretty hungry we both decided on the Bacon Cheeseburger sliders ($12 each + French Fries $3) pretty pricey for the size of them. Came with the usual 3 sliders and you can pay the $3 extra for fries. They weren't bad but could have used a little more seasoning. Washed everything down with a cold beer for (Happy Hour $5)The only minor complaint I have is the extremely loud music which made it hard to have a conversation without having to yell across the table. jollymonknyc.com" u'This is a good place with poor awareness. \xa0I decided to "check-in" at The Jolly Monk.To my delight I got a response that because of my Yelp "check-in" I was deserving of a FREE Sangria or Beer. \xa0Being somewhat challenged and not-necessarily-trusting that I would get something for free I showed the Yelp message to my server. \xa0I confirmed that I had indeed hit the jackpot. \xa0I ordered a delightful Kwak served in the proper vessel. \xa0I would not have ordered it if I had known that I had to pay for it.As it goes the "free" pint upon "check-in" is limited to Swill Beer or Sangria. \xa0Not "real Beer" like Kwak. \xa0When the server brought the bill it came from a new (third) server with a question "Is there a question about the (complimentary Yelp check-in) charges for the beer. \xa0This was a deliberate attempt to insert a new (innocent and otherwise uninvolved) server into the mix at the point of sale. \xa0They knew that they were encountering a potentially explosive Yelp situation.As we questioned the proceedings (out of principle rather than economics) it became clear. \xa0 The manager TODD made sure to make his presence known and assure me that the Yelp message (you know about this already) included a condition that it only applied to Swill beer and Sangria. \xa0Not Real Beer. \xa0My unused Yelp credit for a free Sangria or Swill Beer would be honored in the future.So. \xa0Here\'s my message to The Jolly Monk. \xa0Given that I questioned YOUR offer and was only provided a SHRUG of a response I feel that the difference between a free KWAK and free SWILL BEER is meaningless when one considers the mark-up you charge for ANY BEER and the value that I COULD add to YOUR BUSINESS here. \xa0Instead I piss in the Swill Beer and hope Todd enjoys the effervescence. \xa0Why didn\'t Todd just recognize that I tried to understand his STUPID condition and that YOUR server didn\'t know it either?Todd assured me that I could claim my free Swill Beer in the future upon a future visit. \xa0I am really grateful for that because I choose to come to The Jolly Monk to drink Bud Light and other Swill Beers. \xa0Well not really. \xa0I came here to drink Real Beers.I would actually go back here but I think this is a good place with immature awareness.' u'After an afternoon stroll in the city we ended up here ordered the calamari as appetizer but disappointed they didn\'t have! Then we ordered the portobello salad which I had to return after waiting 30 minutes because it was awful it came with 3 small pieces of Dried mushrooms and the sweet mustard dressing had a stale taste to it exchanged it(which I rarely have to do not picky) for the chopped salad added the chicken for 4$ more. Making the salad 17$ total which to me is a bit pricy for a salad but it Was tasty and filling! Also had the salmon with smashed tater tots. The tots were not good weird mix of sour cream tater tots with a balsamic sauce. The Salmon piece was skimpy and not worth 20$ we left half of it. Overall the customer service was on point This spot is def. for those "catching the game" with some folks and having a drink/ appetizers and probably a burger. Thats all!' u'What happened food-wise? \xa0This used to be my go-to place in the hood to get friendly service with nice open space and good food. \xa0I\'m not sure what happened to the last part but recently it\'s been a big disappointment. \xa0The past few times I\'ve been the food has taken forever to come out and isn\'t well made. \xa0My (usually great) grilled cheese (that took 45 mins to come) was basically warmed buttered bread with unmelted cheese in it. \xa0Last time my husband\'s burger and the guy\'s at the next table both came out overdone and had to be sent back. \xa0They also seem to be out of a lot of menu staples (no brunch on a Sunday afternoon?No pork for the pulled pork sandwich? No brussels sprouts?!). \xa0Apparently there\'s a new "chef" who seems to not care which is a shame because the front of the house staff have always been super great. \xa0Hoping it improves soon!' u"After a year & a half this place continues to be one of our favorites...they have a kids' menu (which is not that easy to find in Manhattan) good (non-stale) beer selection AWESOMELY friendly staff & they treat my daughter like a princess. \xa0Kudos to you Jolly Monk. \xa0Love the brisket burger so much (Even if I can only eat half)!" u'While around the tourist trap that is Times Square a group of 6 of my friends decided to walk over and try this spot.Walked in and were promptly seated by this awesome hostess. The server came over very fast and asked for our order. Food came super quick and that might have been a bit if the problem with some of the food.out of 6 plates we received soggy wings excellent fries and fried pickles. Super delicious calamari and so so mussels.We started eating and drinking but when we got to their "famous" mussels we were not impressed. each had one or two and they were decent until we got what it seemed to be a bad batch. I know they say that they got them fresh but the next 4 were dead and super disgusting.. The waitress came and promptly comped the Mussels. That was really appreciated.Next day i was not feeling well... PS i always eat mussels oysters etc.It happens so next time i will review it again and update.' u"This review is based solely off of their food. Came here one day over the winter when I had a nearby cupcake making class to attend with a friend. We decided to grab lunch here before heading over. I right away noticed the macaroni and cheese on the menu and my eyes lit up. Wherever I see Mac and cheese on a menu I must try it. We decided to go with the beer and bacon macaroni and cheese...it was perrrfecccttt! $15 but worth it..so so so good! Perfectly cooked pasta cheesy and creamy sauce nice smokey flavor from the bacon and a crunch breadcrumb topping. We devoured it and we're even tempted to order another! I definitely want to come back here to try some more of their menu items!" u"Came here for lunch with a friend and have already been back again. This place has amazing food and a great beer list. Whether you're looking for generic domestic beer or different types of craft beer to try this place has what you want. The food as I said is amazing. I ordered the lunch special of tomato soup and a bacon/tomato grilled cheese. it was some of the best tomato bisque I've ever had. smooth and creamy just the way it should be. The sandwich was a little on the greasy side because of the bacon and cheese but it was excellent. On my second trip I went with a mushroom burger and fries. Still great. I'm pretty simple when it comes to my burgers so if they're hot and cooked the way I like then I'm a happy customer. Case in point this burger was hot juicy and had a little blood dripping on the plate. That my friends is a winner in my book." u'*** Corey\'s Trivia NYC "World Tour" Winner: BEST VALUE Manhattan ***I\'m organizing a trivia "world tour" throughout NYC as my friends try to find the combination of a good bar and a good trivia provider (in this case NYC Trivia League). Trivia for The Jolly Monk ran from roughly 8:15-10pm.After going to well over a dozen bar trivia locations throughout NYC The Jolly Monk offers the best value by far for a Manhattan venue. (Two places in Queens offer larger prizes.) That alone should warrant trivia fans checking it out. The best value is driven by them offering the biggest prize I\'ve seen in the borough \xa0- first place is a $50 gift card to the place (which you can also use the same night you receive it); second place is a $25 card. Additionally the team with the best team name (which I imagine also serves as a consolation prize) receives a round of shots. And on top of that if you check in on Yelp (limit once per day) you can get a free drink (I believe the choices are Bud Stella Hoegaarden or sangria). How awesome is all of that? This place is a hidden gem of a trivia location. The prizes nice d\xe9cor (I might consider it for a future date spot) and trivia provider should be attracting tons of people there but unfortunately the two times I went had only six and seven teams (with one of the teams consisting of just a bartender) competing. Based on the number of Yelp reviews (currently at 52) I assume the place is still fairly new and developing a customer base and has some stiff competition from other Midtown bars including an NYC Trivia League location a couple of blocks down (Social) that starts an hour earlier.There\'s a solid beer selection including drink specials (including $5 Stellas). Sweet potato fries are always nice but the entrees I\'ve ordered during my visits (cheeseburger and grilled chicken) were just okay. Prices were reasonable (entrees/sandwiches range from $11 to $22). We had two servers throughout our stay and the first one in particular was very friendly and attentive.Comparing Jolly Monk to Social Jolly Monk dominates Social (and every other Manhattan bar) in the prize category and service while Social had the better burger and earlier start time. But really check out Jolly Monk if you want to go for the trivia glory.' u"My new favorite spot in midtown! The staff is kind and courteous \xa0excellent beer selection \xa0wine you can drink (which rarely happens at midtown sports bars) and a great menu. \xa0I'm working my way through it.... also weds. trivia night is a must." u"Food was much much better than the service which is my reasoning for the 3-star rating and not 4-star. This is another one of those times that I wish Yelp had a 1/2 star system. To be fair the place was pretty packed for a Monday but the food still took waaaaaay too long to come out and there were times that we didn't see our server and waited on drinks etc. Overall disappointing service. \xa0The place has a great selection of beers. I knocked down a 3-4 of the Brooklyn Brown Ales and each went down smooth.We ordered the Brussel Tots and they were awesome cooked perfectly with a nice crunch and loaded with bacon. Hard to go wrong when there's bacon involved :-)My wife inhaled an order of the Mussels -- she went with the traditional cream sauce verses the Spanish style with chorizo and tomato base. I tried a couple and they were OK but I'm not really a mussels guy to begin with. After the apps round we ordered Fish and Chips and the Steak Frites. The Fish and Chips were really good; lightly breaded cod with a big serving of well-seasoned fries. The tarter sauce was fantastic as well and with a little Tabasco and vinegar it was even better. I would definitely recommend. The Steak Frites were just OK in my opinion; the steak was cooked a little over medium and was seasoned well but was a little tough in my opinion. Definitely not a great cut of beef and for $22 bucks I expected more. At the end of the day the place has a pretty cool neighborhood vibe above average bar/comfort food and plenty of cold beer to choose from. I just wish the service would have been a little better." u"*** Decent drinks Great ambiance *** Came here for happy hour. There's tons of seating and a great selection of happy hour items. Free sangria if you check in on Yelp!" u"Wow* In the matter of a 2 week span the food quality suffered. I don't know what happened in their kitchen. Let me start off on a positive note. The service was awesome this last time our server was a woman named Young - she was fantastic. \xa0Now for the negatives. I ordered what I usually order - Mac and cheese a Monk burger with a salad and wings. The mac and cheese suddenly became dry and not cheesey? I guess they changed their recipe what a bummer.The onion jam on the burger tasted sour. I ordered a medium rare burger and it came out well done and burnt on one side. I ordered the salad with my favorite white balsamic dressing and it just wasn't the same. The wings were underdone and soggy. I really don't know what went on in 2 weeks but please fix it. My coworkers and I really enjoyed coming here on our lunch hour but not anymore. :(" u"I had a great experience here. I never really had a reason to come in but I was fine having bar-ish food for dinner and was craving a beer so I tried the jolly monk. The beer selection is on point. I had an affordable ($12) beer flight with a big selection of beers to choose from. For appetizers I think fried pickles and fried cheese are a hit and nearly every appetizer is something deliciously fried. For dinner I was lame and tried the chopped salad and didn't regret it. It was fresh and well prepared. I think burgers are a huge hit here. Pop in with a small group or table for two and share a few beers or snacks and I don't think you will be disappointed." u"This Jolly Monk is the Applebees of Hell's Kitchen. There are so many more unique places around that there's no reason to stop here. The interior truly looks and feels like a bar & grille in a Midwestern shopping mall. The food is just OK. For a belgian beer bar it has surprisingly few interesting beers on tap - think Hoegaarden. I was hoping for some hard to find trappist ales like Achel but their beer list is far away from that." u'Really liked the space and great beer options. \xa0That being said our bartender was really cold and unwelcoming. She seemed annoyed having to get our drinks (2 people sitting at the bar). \xa0Every time she stopped by she would ask the person I was with if he wanted another and didn\'t ask if I needed anything when I was clearly almost done my drink. When she would drop off his drink I\'d order mine. \xa0I understand having to make 2 trips is annoying but how about being a little proactive/engaging and ask if we both need anything. Listen I\'m a "please and thank you" kind of guy on EVERY drink order/drop off so it\'s really annoying to be given attitude when I\'m being polite/grateful and you\'re pissed at me for you not doing your job efficiently. The couple next to us was getting full smiles warmth and attentive service while we sat there like unwanted step children.']
73.The Hummus & Pita Co,[u"Super!!! Delicious food friendly staff. Best hummus and falafel ever :-)Everything is fresh. You can make Your perfect composition what You want to eat. It's perfect place for relax after sightseeing or to relax from loud NYC" u'There is a lot to like here -- great hummus grilled vegetables are good fried eggplant is strong. \xa0The service is quick and professional. \xa0Unfortunately there is a huge drawback: \xa0your main dish here is going to be either the lamb or the chicken and the chicken is regularly over-cooked -- as in possibly microwaved to death. \xa0That pretty much blows up the experience. \xa0When the chicken is splintering in your mouth none of the other positives matter much. They fix that and this is a 4 star joint.' u'Food is great; service is not.Went here for the first time and was trying to figure out the menu as I was rushed through. Wasn\'t given options on the things I could add/modify and was rushed through. Anyone who helped me kept looking away or talked to another employee while helping me. At the end I was charged the wrong amount because the employee was talking to a friend when she rang me up. I corrected the mistake and she blamed it on someone else. Then I asked for my fountain drink since the menu said "make it a combo with fries and a fountain drink". Well they got rid of their fountain drinks so I was offered a can of soda.Again I\'d eat here again because the food was SO good but the service pushed me away for good. So many other options I would have like to have tried too. If I could order online I\'d try it again but who knows if they offer that. I\'d ask but they would ignore me and stare out the window while I talked to no one.' u"This place is really really good... Like crack... It's so good yet sooooo bad for you... Here's my reasoning. I took a peek at the nutritional information for each of the dishes and this place loads it up on sodium. It was insane. Not trying to be a downer but there are definitely some smoke and mirrors here.

I doubt that they are trying to cover anything but rather get to the bottom of things and see if the data is incorrect. Either way they need to answer." u'Concept was uniquen prices were a bit high but compare to the portion it was fair enough. I asked for a Laffa with Eggplants & falafel i was disappointed by 1 thing & thats the Bread. I am Arab I know how thin & soft a laffa bread must be instead they used a kind of thinner version if Taboon which is still considered thick comparing to a normal fresh arabic bread. It was hard to bite in it & it was defenitly not easy to chew it.' u"Dear god! I was not aware that this place was open until last night when I was going to pass out of hunger. Yelp has totally saved my life.I had one of the best falafel sandwiches I've had. (This doesn't include Mamoun's) I ordered your regular falafel sandwich in a pita bread with house hummus and salad and it was heaven on Earth. However I came here at night an hour before they closed so I guess the service wasn't on point as a lot of the food wasn't ready or they had run out of items. In any case awesome food and quick. They also have beer in case you're in the mood for a drink without the bar atmosphere. One downfall is that there are a lot of homeless folks in the area so sitting on the first floor isn't ideal if you don't want to be bothered." u'So far the food has been great here. The prices are outstanding. Every bit you get a bang for your buck.' u'I had the shawarma bowl alongside some hummus chickpea salad and an assortment of toppings. Food was fresh flavorful and delightfully spicy. Portions were huge!!!' u"I can't get enough of this place. Seriously! Everything is just exploding w/ flavor and super tasty! I kinda wish I hadn't discovered The Hummus & Pita Co. b/c now I'm addicted! Try it and I'm pretty sure you'll feel the same way.The first couple times I visited I got a pita sandwich.... but then I learned that you can ditch most of the dirty carbs and get a meal just as delicious AND filling. I usually get the Shawarma Chicken Platter which comes with three sides! It's definitely the way to go if you have big appetite like me! I've tried some of the other proteins but seem to always return to the chicken shawarma b/c it's very tender and seasoned just right! As for the sides for the platter you can't go wrong with just about any of them. I typically try to go for the healthy-ish ones and get the Israeli Salad Tabouli and Saut\xe9ed Veggies. THEN the best part of all is the toppings/accoutrements selection. It's freakin' unlimited and all of them are on target! I load up on lettuce tomato purple cabbage pickled onions green and red pepper paste feta cheese +++ Just get them all. You will not regret it!Note that platters also come w/ a pita (white or wheat) on the side but I always tell them to not include it; it's not really needed." u"There is no better falafel lunch!!! Get the bowl with all the veggies your heart could desire for $8 and if you have enough self control...it'll be two meals worth! Comes with whole wheat (my preference) or regular pita. I RARELY say this but this place has my heart give'm some business you'll be so happy you did" u'I liked the place. Had the chicken breast on a plate with 3 sides... Guys were really helpful with the ordering process ... The "steak" didn\'t look too much like a winner - but if you read my review of the Thai joint in London... I\'m a bit jaded toward beef right now lol Seating is good- has upstairs too. Clean and has refillable fountain drinks. All in all a great place. Right next to some bus stop too... Which is odd because we are going to catch a bus but at the 33rd street stop lol - a lot of people eating here are waiting for a bus.' u"the shawarma here tastes so good it's addictive definitely one of my favorite lunch spots near work" u"Round 2! \xa0The experience was much better during my second go-around. \xa0I ordered the same meal that gave me some issues the day before and the delivery arrived promptly.This time the food met all of my expectations based on all the reviews I read on Yelp. \xa0Previously my platter was good aside from the fact the gyro was bad and had a dry/crispy texture. \xa0This time the gyro was tender juicy and very flavorful. \xa0The side dishes (corn salad cous cous and cole slaw) along with the hummus was awesome. \xa0All around the meal was terrific and I'm glad that after an off night they were able to notice my feedback and the results were solid. \xa0I can say that this experience was far better than my previous one and I'm looking forward to ordering more food from here in the future." u"Awesome location with a great view. I was looking for something healthy around lunchtime in time square and this place came up on yelp. A lady was handing out 10% off coupon outside the door so I decided to go in. It looks a lot like chipotle for Greek food and is set up very similar. I tried the lamb and beef and it got one side with it. It turned out very nice. I did have a miscommunication with checkout person which the manager had to fix and was kind of stressed out about. Maybe it's because they were so new but I definitely would go back for their great food quality." u"It's fine. Got 2 plates: chicken breast & chicken shawarma.Chicken breast was cubed into thick pieces. Dry tasteless and it was so thick then when you bit into it the inside was fully cooked but cold. Chicken shawarma is where it's at. Not only is it cheaper than the chicken breast cubes but the chicken shawarma is also marinated in a sauce and it comes out warm and delicious. Don't make the noob mistake of ordering chicken breast. The beet roots are a no. I love Mediterranean food but this place won't be my new stomping ground. The hummus is rather bland." u"I absolutely loooooove pita chips and hummus! I was meeting up with a friend for lunch during the work day and she was coming from Port Authority and we found that Hummus & Pita Co was a close place. The ordering process is very much similar to Chipotle where you first pick your protein and then toppings afterwards. I decided to get a falafel bowl with cous cous and babaganoush. Every order comes with a slab of hummus and pita bread!As far as the taste the hummus was a little bland so I think next time I'm going to get flavored hummus (it costs extra $$). However the portions were very good and I was able to have some food leftover! Definitely get a bowl over a gyro --- you get so much more food." u'The Hummus & Pita Co is my favorite Mediterranean fast food spot in NYC. They have perfect falafels with the perfect crispy exterior. I also love the variety of toppings and sides that you can choose for the platter.I usually get the Falafel Platter which includes 5 balls of crispy falafels 3 sides and as many "toppings" as you want. My go-to sides are roasted eggplant baba ganoush Israeli cous cous or stuffed grape leaves. Some of the sides especially the roasted eggplant and cous cous are really oily though so probably \xa0not that healthy. The unlimited toppings include pickled cabbage pickles lettuce onions etc. You also get to choose different types of hummus. I would recommend the original or spinach & feta.' u"The Yelp app is like a local friend... guiding your clueless ass in a foreign land... Thanks Jeremy Stoppleman for creating Yelp(CEO and inventor of Yelp) for saving my keester in odd travel situations....not knowing where to find a good meal QUICK...Found this gem in Times Square... using the Yelp App like a red tipped cane... for my blind ass...I didn't even know what to order so I looked at the pics.... hmmm this looks good... and ordered straight from the Yelp Pics...(so I didn't look dumb) ahahahahahaThis place is like a Subway Sandwiches in the ordering sense.. you order from the bar but the food is different and made me want it the rest of my trip... food you think about on later days... when you are hungry.. that doesn't happen to me often... but when it does.. you know it is true food love...ORDER: Laffa Bread with hummus spread with falafal grilled/fried eggplant cucumbers Taziki sauce and some chili spice sauce on the side... The equivalent of a very humongous \xa0burrito... sub 10 bucks...

The place to go to eat SMART is Humus and Pita. The pita (whole wheat) was tasty along with the fresh vegetables and chicken. This is all TOP SHELF food that - when you finish - you actually feel satisfied. And MORE satisfied than that place that starts with a CH...The whole restaurant was very clean and the service was the AMAZING. It is not my style to write reviews as most restaurants are either mediocre or just plain not that good. Humus and Pita meets all the criteria for a satisfying and nutritious meal - on the go. And the service is what puts this establishment - OVER THE TOP. Never having ever been to this place I was warmly greeted by the Counter Person - Luis. This is what made my visit worthwhile. He selected various sides - all which were perfect and put together a meal that was PERFECT. And this was not done in a hasty get the customer served manner. I honestly feel that he really cared about the customer - and THAT is why I am writing this review. In other words he exemplifies total Food & Beverage professionalism - which makes this place the GEM for all of the workers in the area - as well as the tourists. Please do yourself a favor and visit this restaurant - and STOP the quick pizza chex-mex Chip.....syndrome - and enjoy a high quality meal with fresh vegetables tasty hummus and excellent beverages - such as Green Tea etc. I hope that this review is published - in the hopes that more people will catch on to correct eating - as this is the place to do it. All my best to Humus and Pita - Theater District.' u"I've been to Roti on 43rd probably more times than I should... So I was expecting Hummus & Pita Co. to do me the same favor and give me similar flavors for the same price. \xa0So they pretty much serve the same things although I believe Hummus & Pita probably has way more options. \xa0The way this works is you line up and you choose what you'd like - it could be a pita shell filled with food or a bowl/platter (two or three sides up to you). \xa0I believe hummus is free (it's called hummus & pita co.) with a choice of a protein and three sides plus any sauces and toppings. \xa0I went with chicken with tzaziki hummus israeli salad Mediterranean rice and grilled veggies. \xa0No problem with the sides at all - plus pita bread was included yum. \xa0What I really didn't like was the chicken - it just wasn't as flavorful as I had liked. \xa0And the hummus was really bitter not like hummus should have tasted. \xa0Maybe that's just my taste or because I've had Roti where the hummus and meat are more suited to what I like to eat.The line moves fairly quickly and the price isn't bad for Midtown lunch ($10). \xa0They also offer boxed fruit and nuts etc. \xa0I would highly recommend if you really love choices because they have a lot or if you're vegetarian. \xa0Don't go for the hummus."]
75.An’Nam,[u'Great Duck Buns. Great Hot and Sour Soup rock shrimp and lobster roll.Great after theatre place. Nice decor atmosphere and good prices. Would return on a future NY trip.' u"I wish I could give this 10 stars. I'm usually skeptical of places that offer a variety of cuisines but this place stole my heart (and tummy). Ordered the lunch pho and pad thai - for $9 each! Each was expertly prepared. And I couldn't believe the value for such great quality and quantity. My husband and I were both stuffed! Both dishes were so flavorful and fresh. I would eat at this place every day if I could. I LOVED it. Friendly and attentice service. Kept filling our ice waters which is top notch in my book. Clean and comfortable atmosphere. Adding this place to all my future trips to NYC." u"Cut of fish is top notch. As good as it gets.The noodle soups are fantastic. It's a half block from Times Square. In fact 2 theaters are on the block (The Kerr and Long acre) Delivery is extremely fast always quicker than estimated.The interior dining room is very nice and comfortable. You could entertain any business lunch there or date.Prices are fantastic. Especially lunch but dinner too for the area. Need I say more. PS I live in the neighborhood. I know the area." u'It was empty when we went in on a Sunday night. I thought the prices were a too expensive for Asian food IMO. the decor and ambience is definitely nice. They have clean spacious bathrooms too. The food was just alright. But they do give you pretty good portions. The service was nice.' u"I ordered pho and the first thing I did was taste the broth which was delicious. I poured the broth over the noodles and sliced raw beef and stirred to let the beef cook slightly. Unfortunately very little of the beef was edible the vast majority of it was pure fat (see picture). It was very difficult to eat this pho while trying to pick around all of the inedible fat.I also deducted a star because most of the prices on their menu are wrong. I tried ordering dumplings that are listed as $4 and was told that they're actually $7. I tried ordering pho from the regular menu which is listed as $9 but was told it's actually $12. I ended up getting the lunch menu pho which is actually $9." u'"Asian fusion" places always worry me because I usually find they do at most one cuisine well--often they are Chinese restaurants converted to fusion because sushi and Thai have become more popular than General Tso\'s chicken.After our $9 lunch specials here the jury is still out. Most of the options were Chinese or Thai and the staff appeared to be Chinese. The one Vietnamese dish we tried--vermicelli with shrimp was closer to Chinese than Vietnamese and too greasy but the pad Thai was ok.The price was very reasonable \xa0for the theater district and the decor is very nice. The staff was very attentive. Obao and Qi Bangkok are better area options but if your theater is closer to An\'nam and you do not have time for the extra walk weigh An\'nam against its neighbor Pongsri Thai.' u'Awesome pho one block from the W hotel and in the heart of Times Square! Warm hot pho with tons of meats and great flavored broth. I will definitely be back! If you are looking for soup on a cold day this is definitely your spot!' u'After walking around Central Park my friend and I wanted to get something to eat. I Yelped "Vietnamese" and found this nice Asian fusion spot. First of all they open a hot hand wipe for you which was a first for me. The prices are impressively reasonable considering the location sleek decor and portions they serve. My chicken pad thai was $11 and they really hooked it up! I couldn\'t even finish it which is uncommon for me. My friend ordered curry chicken fried rice and a tuna roll both which she enjoyed to the point that she\'s looking forward to telling her friends about this place. The man who served us (possibly the owner) was great to boot. Would love to come back sometime to try other stuff on their extensive menu.' u"Weekday lunch review with solid 4-stars to food decor and service. \xa0I will go back here for the excellent range of QUALITY FOOD on the menu. \xa0I came here with a work colleague because I was craving soup and Asian food. \xa0I ordered Pho and my friend ordered a Bento Box. \xa0The servings are generous the prices are not excessive and the service is prompt and courteous.The Pho is served in a large bowl with soy beans and a bowl of broth enhancing paste (my best description as I'm a Pho fan but nowhere near an expert). \xa0The Bento Box was nicely spread out on a rectangular plate (a very flat box). \xa0I recall it looked quite appetizing but our conversation was unusually intense and in my self-absorption I have to admit I have no recollection of the various items.The interior DECOR is modern and shiny metropolitan black lacquer and glass. \xa0I didn't notice background music.SERVERS are there to take order deliver food and check on water glasses or other drinks. \xa0The bill was prompt and we were easily in and out within 45 minutes.As a Times Square food option this is a good one for theatre events or curious tourists looking for an alternative to chain store restaurants that the area is so well endowed with." u'Good meal with fusion of Japanese and Vietnamese. Duck was absolutely delicious and the Cod brought tears of heaven.Kids who love sushi are quite happy here also!' u'Great atmosphere. Service is fast and friendly. Food was top notch definitely coming back. I had the the shrimp and vegetable tempura and my brother had the sushi sashimi combo prices was affordable and the flavorful excellent place was empty when we arrived so everytjing came out fast. Thai tea is sooooo goood def. Reccommend it to everyone!' u'Everything we ordered was great! We ordered Pho Grilled Chilean Sea bass grilled pork chop and Philadelphia Roll.' u"Vietnamese AND Japanese cuisine. i know right?! I ended up having one item of each - Pho and Sushi \xa0Flavorful broth and generous portion of meat even for a small bowl. The Red Dragon roll was good! Fam had the bentos which were large enough that two could share. Overall a great experience. Wet wipes before your meal. Attentive staff (water glass was always filled) and quick service. Reasonable prices for Times Square eats. Oh if you like easy listening music ala Lionel Ritchie Phil Collins Chicago (Peter Cetera Chicago) then you'll love this spot and will be humming while you eat. i know i did. Would return and recommend" u'Took family to eat here after watching School of Rock. \xa05 min walk from the Winter Garden Theater. \xa0Made reservation with Peggy (probably manager). \xa0Got seated right away. \xa0The food was very authentic and delicious. \xa0Ordered the duck bun appetizer. \xa0Once my son got over the idea he was eating duck he devoured it. \xa0Like the option of being able to order just a couple. \xa0Most places you need to order the entire duck. \xa0Good spread on the variety of foods. \xa0Got a couple of specialty rolls and traditional rolls. \xa0All pretty good. \xa0The Singapore vermicelli was cooked perfectly. \xa0Also got the squid red curry that was very balanced in flavor. \xa0The waiters were very attentive. \xa0Will definitely dine here again.' u'Ordered lunch beef pho and 2x vietnamese coffee (yep I was dying) $18 out the door with a 20% tip. I was very hesitant to go to a Japanese + Vietnamese place but decided to give it a shot since I wanted pho and that\'s the one harder to mess up that sushi. Then I admitted to myself how often I had wanted light Asian food and then having a hard time deciding between those two cuisines. The menu simply called my target "beef" noodles so I asked the waitress exactly what "beef" and whether was it the fatty kind (which is what I was after). She answered no just thinly sliced beef. Well I can tell you this: half of "beef" the fatty (not the fattest) and very slightly tendon-y beef that was quite perfect with pho (I think it was the lean end of beef belly?) and the other half was the thinly sliced brisket. The latter was a tad too salty but very richly flavoured and quite tender.Very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pho the soup was quite decent and the noodle tasted fresh and was well prepared. Excellent service--though I went at 14:30 so it might just be that everyone has too much time on their hands lol. Will definitely return if I can fit it into this trip with all the other culinary temptations in the city (or when I run low on my budget... lol).' u"This is a great place to eat with a group of friends due to their generous seating. The interior is very modern sleek and clean. I like that the menu is so large and versatile in order to satisfy everyone's needs. Location is in the heart of the theatre district which tends to break the wallets of college students like myself. Luckily this place is decently priced given their large portions and top notch location. Friendly staff & fast service." u'Great potential. \xa0Nice decor. \xa0Flavorful food. But the waiter was not very attentive \xa0and seemed distracted. \xa0The beef teriyaki came out cold and under cooked and had to be sent back. \xa0In NYC too many choices to give them a do-over.' u'I came here for the first time with a group of seven people. They were able to accommodate our large group and I was glad that this place was pretty easy to find and easy to get to! The decor is really nice and modern making me feel a little fancier than usual haha. I ordered the vegetable green curry and I was really surprised to see how quickly the food came out and the huge dish they brought out to me. The presentation of the food was on point and the portions were generous making it a very satisfying meal. The prices are definitely worth it for the amount of food you get and its quality! I would definitely come here again.' u"The interior d\xe9cor and food presentation was on point. Excellent range of Asian fusion. There's Japanese Thai Vietnamese Chinese - and all pretty authentic! (I eat everywhere all the time)I also came here with a very large group of 16 people and the staff was very organized. I came a little early for the reservation and they allowed me to sit at the table with no problem as I waited for my group. They were organized in taking our drink orders regular orders and were never annoyed at all with those who took too long to order or those who came late.The food was amazing. I got the red chicken curry and crispy calamari with mango sauce. Sooo delicious! And the portions were so huge I felt like everyone shared their plate and were stuffed.Can't wait to come back. Great for groups or a perfect date night location." u'I was calling to canvas restaurants to host a group of 14 (including young children which include my 1 1/2 year old twins) \xa0Most of the places I called and requested for two high chairs said that they only have 1? \xa0How does a restaurant in NYC have only 1 high chair? \xa0The reception at An\'nam (wish I could remember her name) also told me that they have 1 high chair but worked with me to accommodate my party for a small retirement dinner for my mother AND would make sure that we would have 2 high chairs. \xa0 The servers who worked with our table were nice and accommodating as well. \xa0The food was good and portions were big. \xa0It was an affordable dinner for a group of 10 adults. \xa0I would recommend An\'nam for a regular dinner or small dinner "event". \xa0The restaurant itself is modern and clean.']
180.Westway Diner,[u'YES I took my family there 6 times in 7 days so kill me. \xa0The menu is massive gyros to italian paninis to breakfast seafood name it its on there. \xa0And we ran the gambit baby. \xa0Everything was really great and that was from ALL my family from a chicken & mango salad to fish and chips (hidden in the Wraps section oddly) corned beef hash and eggs gyros it goes on and on like Heaven on a stick. \xa0The prize winner for me was a new version of bread pudding white dense and delicious that I thoroughly enjoyed with some decaf one nite after we had seen a show. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The ONLY down side for me at all was a corned beef and pastrami sandwich. \xa0If you get it stick with just pastrami. \xa0It seemed to have had some flat top grill time which was awesome but the corned beef was a little too fatty a match for the lean pastrami and I ended up pulling most of it off. \xa0  \xa0 \xa0 Like other reviews here I found the service to be affable and dedicated almost all the time. \xa0In some cases during busier times of day getting drink refills can be a challenge. \xa0The coffee cups are a small sized and I love me some coffee so that can be disheartening when you want to chase that breakfast with some hot java. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 We only had one server who seemed genuinely disinterested in coming back to see us once the food was there and I think it was only because it was a dessert only order after a show and he was not expecting a big tip. \xa0Amazingly the way to guarantee a good tip is to give good service and return often. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Unlike other reviews here I never received a cold anything unless it was supposed to be cold. \xa0The food was always piping hot and delicious. \xa0 \xa0 The prices can seem a little steep compared to chain restaurants for those not accustomed to NYC diner dining. \xa0Soft drinks and dinner entrees for four can run $45-$60 but no one is leaving disappointed. \xa0There is a restaurant every 10 feet in this city (literally) but the fantastic variety brought us back over and over. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0COME GET SOME!! And try the bread pudding if that is your thing it is fabulous!!' u"FINALLY! \xa0The diner I once knew in 2009 has returned!Years after my last review I saw that Westway had undergone a dramatic and modern renovation. \xa0The general layout of the diner is still the same. \xa0When you walk in there's the cashier station in front. \xa0There are a combination of booths and tables (favoring booths) and in the back is still an old fashioned bar but with new furniture and equipment. \xa0I was astounded at the dramatic change (and yes I know they did this a while ago).In sharp contrast to my last visit the staff was on point just as I remembered them being before their dark turn in 2009. \xa0Our waiter had a great sense of humor and he was patient when my girlfriend had a hard time deciding what dish she wanted. \xa0He was also quick moving from one table to another with speed and accuracy. When he wasn't tending to us someone else would pour our water or take away dirty plates. \xa0The service has definitely improved!I had a turkey burger with swiss and sweet potato fries and it was great. \xa0Everything was as good as I remember the place being before. \xa0The burger was juicy and cooked well the cheese was melted onto the bread (awesome!) and the fries were wonderfully crispy. \xa0Side note: coleslaw fans take heart it's great! \xa0I also appreciated all the condiments (from ketchup to hot sauces) already being on the table.I'm so happy this place has gone back to being the diner I remember with a brighter and cleaner look." u"Hit or miss.Fast delivery and ok food. Not everything is awesome but it's good. I will say their chicken Caesar wrap is good...when they remember to put dressing on it. It's my little local diner so I order from here for convince. But on many occasions something is always forgotten from my order. Their roast chicken dinner with stuffing is actually really delicious. Muffins are stale and have very little flavor. Budget food I guess." u"After searching Yelp for a place to eat (and being overwhelmed with all the choices) my mom and I decided we would just wander around and find somewhere for dinner. Restaurant after restaurant had HUGE lines and we just didn't feel like waiting around to eat. That's when we walked past Westway Diner and thought- let's give this place a try!SO GLAD WE DID! This place was great! For one it was quite empty. Saturday night around 7 and there were so many open tables! Some may see emptiness as a bad sign after being surrounded by millions of people today having space felt amazing!The menu is QUITE EXTENSIVE. Wow. So many choices. I went with a chicken parm panini. It was delicious!!! The fries were hot and crispy! So good!My mom had a pastrami and corned beef sandwich. It was huge! So much meat on it! She loves it! Our server was so nice! Indoor and outdoor seating.Loved getting away from Times Square- way too busy over there.And to top it all off after the fact I read that this diner was a meeting spot for LARRY DAVID & JERRY SEINFELD!!!! Omg!!!! I love love love them!!!Highly highly recommend!" u"Geez some of you fellow Yelpers are harsh! Westway Diner certainly deserves 4 stars not a lousy 3!!I'm forever hungry so diners literally keep me alive. Westway boasts an extensive menu of all day eggs sandwiches salads and dinner options. I was debating myself between either a burger or a salad and then I was hit by a sudden craving for breakfast again. So I decided on a grilled cheese with 2 scrambled eggs. It came with a side of coleslaw and a pickle. Obviously not the fanciest order but it was just what I needed. The wheat toast was very nicely grilled I must say it was crisp and slightly nutty tasting actually. I had a lot of time on my hands so I decided to linger and just order unlimited coffee refills. Service here is fast and courteous which is another reason for my 4 stars. This part of Hell's Kitchen gets tons of foot traffic from locals and tourists alike so you're bound to see all sorts of characters pop in. Definitely stop by if you've got time on the weekends for a long brunch." u"Our family is glad we found this place. \xa0We went their many times during our stay in NYC.The prices aren't ridiculous and the staff is super friendly. \xa0They have something for everyone. \xa0It was nice to be able to sit down and have a decent lunch with the family. \xa0Sunday Brunch was a big hit. \xa0Thank you for your kindness and service." u'When you want to have cawffee talk with your friends but everyone comes from different parts of the city it\'s good to find a mid point where it\'ll be convenient for everyone. This is the place for us. \xa0 We\'ve came here a few times to eat and drink coffee. \xa0The coffee is so so. \xa0It can improve just a bit. \xa0The menu is very extensive. \xa0I usually order the turkey burger deluxe. \xa0It comes with fries but one time I was able to switched it up and get the onion rings instead. \xa0I usually stick with savory items but their sweet breakfast items look good too...I\'m talking about you waffle. \xa0Maybe next time. \xa0I like to call out meetings the "Weekly/Bi-weekly/Month Emotional Support Group Meeting." \xa0It\'s great to have friends where you can just sit and talk with.' u'Oh Westway... You gave us all quite a scare when you papered over your windows and disappeared for a while last year. \xa0Not another Hell\'s Kitchen casualty!!Thankfully this was a rare instance where "closed for renovations" could actually be taken at face value and you reappeared like the Phoenix more triumphant that ever. \xa0Yes you\'re now a little shinier than your average greasy spoon. \xa0But if that\'s what it takes to make you palatable to both locals and tourists alike then so be it. \xa0But ironically just a little more grime would\'ve earned that 5th star methinks. I love you for your weighty tome of a menu  whose pages you can pore over for a solid half hour and still wider if you made the right choice \xa0(correct answer - one of everything!) This spot is perfect for a late night cup of chili or bowl of soup with grilled cheese to warm you up on a late winter night. \xa0And its matzo balls are the best around following the tragic demise of Cafe Edison. \xa0Also great for a post-show dessert or milkshake. \xa0Late lunching here between shows on a Saturday is already great fun. \xa0On a nice spring day where the patio seating is open you\'re all but guaranteed to see some of your thespian pals making their way up and down 9th Ave. Thank goodness for spots like Westway that remain. \xa0#savenyc' u"One of the few diners left in Time's Square/ Hell's Kitchen. The breakfast food is always good for curing hangovers! And a great go to spot if you have a dog you can sit outside in the summer. Highly recommend." u"So much food I couldn't believe it. \xa0We really enjoyed the fast-paced vibe of Westway Diner on a Sunday morning. Lots of locals and tourists fill this place but we didn't have to wait. \xa0I had the corned beef hash and eggs with potatoes and toast. \xa0I think I ate about a third of my plate. We also had the challah french toast and bottomless cups of coffee. \xa0The French toast was great and the service was prompt and attentive. \xa0This place is a great value for the amount and quality of food we received. \xa0Easy walk from Times Square or Hell's Kitchen areas." u'According to NYC.com "The self-proclaimed number one diner in Manhattan and birthplace of the popular television sitcom Seinfeld this place offers the entire spectrum of diner grub--milkshakes hamburgers deli sandwiches French fries simply the works. Certain to please the most finicky of kids!" Oh my I don\'t know where to start. \xa0Everything here was on point!!Just off the bat they\'re outdoor seating area was fantastic and a great option!! We sat inside however in their 50s style booth. My coworker mentioned how comfy they were. Ambience for sure is nostalgic to diner feel but yet very upgraded and very modern. It was also very clean. It was just so nice inside.Our waitress man.. she was AWESOME!! She reminded me of my "Yeta" when I was a kid. She could read me like a book. I ordered Challah French Toast and while I couldn\'t make a decision whether to order bacon or their homemade sausage she said "Bacon" but later gave me both. \xa0She said "I knew you wanted both!" \xa0Man... was that cool or what?My coworker had his California omelet which he even said "Man... this was the best breakfast I\'ve had in years and service is on point!!" And believe me he\'s from Florida!! Hahaha...If you\'re looking for a SOLID AMERICAN DINER you have to come Westway Diner. They have EXCELLENT food and EXCELLENT customer service!!Until then Cheers! ~ :p' u'It\'s not about being put off sir it\'s about being disgusted.We were siting at the counter so we could see your cook periodically sneezing; talking on the phone all while "working"Maybe you can trust him making your food (doubt it) but I wont.My friend and I have complained to Health department so now you are there problem.' u"Food and service were decent. This was the only meal I had on Saturday and around midnight going into Sunday I developed severe food poisoning that's still ravaging my body several days later." u'Again Peter your short order guy does not know how to cook basic items such as toast eggs burgers omelettes etc. Your breads ground beef are the lowest quality ingredients imho. \xa0Chicken salad sammie was outright disgusting with mushed up minimal SHREDs in old mayo on stale rye toast. Should ve never left the kitchen. \xa0Chicken fingers slopped on a plate no garnish unappetizing frozen deep fried yuck. Soup so salty inedible. \xa0I could go on but it s embarrassing. \xa0Your location is the only thing WestwaY has going. \xa0There s too much competition and you guys have not kept up. \xa0And your price hikes are ridiculous. \xa0If the food quality was up to snuff I don t mind paying. \xa0Oh and no CC for phone order delivery? \xa0Really? \xa0Bad business. \xa0Don t worry the tourists will keep coming...I will not. \xa0Your fabulous waiter Miguel deserves a better place to work.' u"Came here after a fashion show with a group & love that it has late hours. \xa0My chicken caesar wrap was yummy they were very accommodating of our group without breathing down our necks. \xa0Great find & I'd come back." u"Canned or frozen spinach on Eggs Florentine? Hollandaise sauce that probably came out of a tube? Gross! Coffee is decent. Service is mediocre. Ambiance is acceptable diner not grimy or dirty clean and acceptable. Probably won't be back intentionally but if I was stuck in a pinch for a quick bite I would *maybe* return. But with lots of other good options in the neighborhood it is unlikely." u"Have been going to the Westway for about 20 years probably more. Old-fashioned NYC diner -- great burgers fries shakes salads etc. The servers & hosts truly try to accommodate people even providing excellent service in the Wednesday pre-matinee rush. Have been here in the afternoons evenings and in the middle of the night -- it's always good.I often recommend it to tourist families who are out of patience & out of money from all of the restaurant eating they've done in Manhattan on their visit. It's good for such families because the menu is sterotypically huge so everyone can get whatever they want at the same restaurant & it's a diner so the kids can get a bit fidgety if they need to without it disturbing anyone.Honestly the only thing I would change is that there are too many itsy bitsy tables stuck in the middle of the floor. I sat against the wall today & watched the host try to seat 3 parties in 5 minutes at one of these tables & everyone asked to be moved elsewhere. They recently renovated & could have added a potted plant or 2 to allow people to feel a bit protected but chose this layout instead." u'wandering around hells kitchen looking for a late night brenner to satisfy my sweet tooth i stumbled on this diner.off the bat lighting upholstery and cleanliness are stand out over other diners in hells. and theres a good mox of people of all ages and walks of life - group project meetings seniors cop and late night yelpers like me.i think that not being 24/7 is better for diners in the city. people get tired and dgaf late in the city they need to go home and sleep. it isnt a diner culture like jersey so theres no larger reason to try.ordered french toast with vanilla ice cream. bread was light thick and fluffy. a little light on salt but thats ok. ice cream was sweet but too creamy nice. and a clean presentation. IG worthy. but not 5 stars because true diner greatness is about that nomtastic satisfaction. a late night craving that makes you happy. the ending to a story about a great night out. this place is worthy but it leaves something to be desired.' u"Great service Ok food.Service: Server was extremely friendly and helpful! I first ordered the quiche but it turned out that it sold out. Then our server kept apologizing to me although it wasn't even her fault. Then she recommended the lobster rivioli in pink sauce as her personal favorite. When I was hesitating about wether to order an appetizer she told me that the rivioli comes with soup and the portion is very generous. Food: the sauce tasted pretty good but the color was a bit too artificial. Amazingly the lobster filling has a good taste of fresh seafood it is rare for cheap eats in dinners. However I couldn't really tell what was in the filling the meat was too mashed. The portion was big for me that I didn't finish it-eight huge riviolis and a plate-full of sauce." u'God service reasonable price. Feels like genuine breakfast place.']
44.Taqueria Tehuitzingo,[u"Live fairly close to this taqueria so I was excited to learn that it had great reviews on Yelp. Came here spontaneously with my roommate a couple of nights ago despite the shabby exterior and sketchy vibes we got from the ambiance. It is a small small shop - flanked by other sketchy Hell's Kitchen businesses. The only reason why we decided it was worth frequenting was because of the A+ Yelp reviews (thanks guys!)We tried the tamales + the chicken tacos. Both were actually super super tasty. Tacos were simple but flavorful and the tamales too - not a lot of filling which helped bring the flavor of the tortilla out. It was fairly empty when we came for dinner (I guess it gets really crowded more into the nighttime so I'm glad we avoided the crowd) but the food still took a good amount of time to make. Made me think it was truly made-to-order!We were nervous about getting sick from the food etc. but it was just overall a quite tasty meal. I'd definitely come back for a bite." u"Really tasty carnitas with a little crust on the pork from the grill just the way I like it. \xa0Plenty of meat in both the lengua and the carnitas.Green salsa is tasty and mild as advertised. \xa0The red sauce is definitely spicier but not in a burning off your eyebrows sort of way. \xa0It has a good chili flavor that's not hidden by unnecessary heat.One order of tacos is two tacos no rice or beans. \xa0Two orders was probably one more taco than I needed. \xa0Next time I'll get one order and an extra taco on the side. \xa0You pay slightly more for individual tacos but nothing ridiculous.The Pozole stew had plenty of meat and hominy in the soup itself. The provided a little container of cilantro a lime wedge and some chili spice to add to the soup. \xa0The broth needed the spice. \xa0While the broth was fine in a chicken soup kind of way it really didn't have a strong flavor kick so the chili powder was a necessary addition. I'd have liked some shredded lettuce too.The quesadillas are huge.The last time I was there it took them 20 minutes to fill my lunch order with only one other person in the place because it turned out that they had a big phone order that they were working to fill. \xa0I was kind of pissed because the guy behind the counter told me that they'd have the order right up and didn't say squat to me while I was waiting at the counter all that time until I asked. \xa0I don't mind waiting but next time please tell me I'm going to wait. \xa0If I weren't in a hurry to get back and eat before a 1 PM meeting I might have been a little more tolerant of the wait because the food was good so that's why they're still hanging on to that fourth star." u"For the area what a great surprise.The inside is quite small with seats for about a dozen or more.I ordered a torta which turned out to be one of the better tortas I've had. Breaded milanesa with a stringy cheese pickled veg a slighly crusty roll and with a touch of hot sauce made the sandwich sublime." u"I tried this place after reading the great reviews and seeing the pictures on Yelp. The food looked amazing especially the chips. So I walked the long walk from my job to this place and got two tacos and chips and guac to go. Never again! Not sure if they just give takeout orders their scraps because they won't be there to send it back but....The chips were dried out and looked nothing like the pictures I'd seen. My pork taco I couldn't eat because it was mainly globs of fat with a few pork strips thrown in. SMH!" u'Ok so my husband and I decided to order takeout from here last night because we were in the mood for burritos and the chipotle nearby had pretty bad reviews on Yelp. We had eaten there before with no issues but wanted to give this highly rated and "authentic" Mexican restaurant a try. What a mistake. The ordering process was simple enough. We ordered nachos without meat a spicy pork burrito and a chicken burrito. The food was ready when we got there. Service friendly. The food even tasted OK going down. Nothing special but not bad. A little greasy for me but not too bad. However as soon as I stopped eating my tummy began to rumble and bloat. My husband got nauseous and had diarrhea. \xa0Really. I should have just gone to Chipotle which is what I will do once I can stomach a burrito again...so turned off right now. Will never go back. Especially after walking by this morning and noticing their B rating which I had totally overlooked because I was so sold from the reviews and because it\'s partially hidden by the rain protector door thing. B rating. Eeew. \xa0Never again.' u'This place is a hole in the wall and not much to look at but has excellent authentic Mexican food. \xa0This place was near our hotel and we were in the mood for Mexican and decided to try it out.I had chicken fajitas. \xa0It is did not guacamole or source cream like you usually see just super rice beans and the chicken with peppers and onions. \xa0Very tasty.However I wish I had ordered what my nephew chicken in mole sauce. \xa0That sauce was out of this world I stole as much as I could. \xa0His chicken was really moist and delicious. \xa0My other nephew also loved his burrito and devoured it in a millisecond.Unfortunately it did not look like they had alcohol and seating is really limited. \xa0No surprise it was busy at 3pm I could see this place being packed at normal meal times' u'Not good. I had 4 different tacos and they were tasteless and dry. I had to throw them out. Waste of money.' u"Yummy and delicious. Stopped in after reading all of the great reviews on here. Small place (with maybe 6 tables) and is a little crammed but you're there for the food. I had the bistec al pastor and carnitas. All were delicious but the carnitas were my favorite. Everything on the tacos tasted very fresh. It was fairly crowded when we stepped in but the food came out in a relatively quick manner. Can't think of any complaints other than size (we were in the table closest to the door which had a slightly awkward placement)." u"As someone from California I can be a pretty big Mexican food snob. So I never have too high expectations when I try out Mexican food elsewhere. But I was really craving nachos one day and saw that this place was located pretty close to my apartment so I decided to give it a try! I got the nachos with carne asada and wasn't blown away but it satisfied my craving. For $9.50 they give pretty generous portions of meat and guacamole so as far as pricing in NYC goes it's a pretty good deal." u"Live nearby and tried it on the recommendation of a work colleague. The quesadillas are great some of the best cheap mex food available in midtown; the tacos and burritos are good but less standout. \xa0Recommend the chorizo and al pastor. It's def no Cafe Ollin but worth a shot!" u"I was craving some yummy guacamole and tacos. This place had such good reviews and it had really affordable prices. I was excited to go here for lunch with a friend. After trying the tacos nachos and guacamole I can honestly say I will never come back here ever. The chips were stale. The guacamole was bland and the meat was extremely dry. Despite our buyer's remorse my friend and I tried to eat the food anyway. Halfway through eating the food we stopped eating because we just lost our appetite. Overall the food was presentable looking but it severely lacked taste and quality. It wasn't worth trying even for the prices." u"The food is ok but don't get the rice.I got a breakfast burrito and almost broke my tooth on something. Turns out it's the rice. I kept eating thinking that it was just a bad piece but I was able to take out the rest of the rice in ONE piece. Gross.One bonus: called the restaurant and the person over the phone gave me a refund. The best thing was that he was sincerely apologetic. Perhaps I'll try this place again sans the rice (everything else in the burrito was ok)." u"Taqueria Tehuitzingo doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let the size fool you! These tacos (pollo al pastor and carnitas) are some of the best I've ever had. Simple flavorful and delicious! The obvious downside is the size but we had no issues at 6pm on a Friday night." u"one tequila...two tequila...three tequila...four tequilsa...five twequila..six tequikla...ninetenquila TACOS!!!Cheap... good food in time square! I'm sold!Gotta love their service as well as their sandwiches!!! The guy was very nice in helping me with my order because it was so hard to order just one particular taco..so I ordered two... and a Cuban sandwich for myself....I can't help it....i thought the sandwich was delicious! I the tacos was good but i'm not really a big fan of the taco..the soft shell on the outside was somewhat dry..but the ingredients inside the taco was full and flavorful... honestly i would just order the same sandwich next time I come visit....The place is clean...yet small...only three to four tables...not really good for a group hang out...perfect for a quick lunch! service is good and food is great.... What's there to complain about?! :-)" u"My neighborhood spot. Inexpensive and quick. These are the businesses we New Yorkers depend on to eat out and relax. I'm a vegan so I can't speak to the meat dishes but vegetarian tacos are fresh and you can order dairy free." u'You know you\'re in New York when "cheap tacos" are $3 each...I got the $4.50 mini carnitas quesadilla with $1 additional guacamole. They gave a generous portion of meat but it was kind of tough. Guacamole was just okay. I also went at 9am for takeout and it took almost 30 minutes! Not somewhere for a grab-and-go.They have a pretty extensive menu though so I\'ll probably update my review after I give it another chance.' u"Upgrading my rating to 5!Ordered from here last night after seeing their name on Seamless. Delivery took a while but man it was so worth it!I tried to get 5 tacos 2 carnitas 1 pollo 1 al pastor and 1 barbacoa. The restaurant called to tell me that they had ran out of carnitas so I switched to beef instead. Let's get down to the results:Portions - AMAZING! I don't think I've ordered from anywhere else that's close to as generous as these guys! The tacos were SO filled I barely had enough room to add in guac! The guac came in a round tin container that a lot of places use to deliver rice (think any Indian restaurant) which I was super pleasantly surprised by seeing that most places would give me guac in tiny plastic containers.Food - GREAT as I've experienced before. I think the chicken taco is my new favorite after the Al Pastor. Definitely will be ordering from this place whenever I get taco cravings!" u'Ordered the following from Taqueria Tehuitzingo last night:Bistec TacoTinga de Pollo TacoChorizo C/Papa TacoTortas (Sandwich)Flor de Calabaza (Pumpkin Flower) QuesadillaThe food was warm and delivery was fast. However we missed a whole order of chorizo tacos ($7 value); the torta which was supposed to have breaded chicken had shredded chicken; and the flor de calabaza quesadilla for which I paid an extra $1 for chicken had no meat.Although the food was good the mis-execution of our orders was disappointing. Not convinced I will be ordering from them again.' u"Food was amazing some of the best tacos I've ever had. Affordable prices and friendly staff. Didn't give 5***** because of slow service and dirty plates were left sitting on table. Regardless I'll definitely go again." u"Taqueria Tehuitzingo is one of those restaurants I would never normally think to check out partially because I generally avoid the area around Port Authority like the plague but also because it looks like any other little nothing-special restaurant in that immediate area. While it may be little indeed it turns out it's cranking out some awesome big ass tacos!This taqueria is a hole in the wall with just a few tables crammed together in front of a small counter. The menu is lengthy featuring tacos burritos quesadillas tortas and more with over 15 filling options (mostly meat but a few vegetarian).My friend and I each got an order of carnitas tacos (2 tacos per order $6 each). These may have been some of the most generously-filled tacos I've eaten in Manhattan. And they were gooood. The pork was crispy and flavorful and it came cloaked with raw white onions and the freshest cilantro. Our guacamole and chips ($6) also came as a large portion and were decent. I wanted to order a chorizo/potato burrito to (mostly) eat for lunch the next day but they were out of that filling so I ended up just choosing carnitas again. The burrito ($9.50) was stuffed full with rice beans and the works and was very mushy and very VERY mushy the next day. I'd say only come here for the tacos in which the meat takes the spotlight or any of the options that don't totally drown out the meat.I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if you happen to be in the neighborhood and are looking for a cheap quick bite to eat Tehuitzingo's got you covered."]
133.Don’t Tell Mama,[u'DTM is a classic New York piano bar on restaurant row. I go to shows a lot in the capacity of reviewer but don\'t hang out much at the bar. The drinks very cheap. Happy hour wine is 4 dollars and drinks I think are 6 or 7 with house booze. It\'s a relaxed casual and cheap place to hang out with friends (or get liquored up before you go eat at Joe Allen). I have never eaten at DTM so can\'t speak to the food but with Joe Allen so close that\'s my go to for food in the area. The bartenders are all great and sometimes you hear someone singing at the piano that blows your mind. Yesterday was such a day: Amy is a sub on Sundays and she\'s extraordinary. In fact my friend was off to a BBQ and I decided to have an early dinner at Joe Allen. I went to make a phone call and heard "One Note Samba" on the speaker audible from across the street. And I went back and had another drink just to list to Amy. She\'s not the regular person for Sunday afternoon but I hope DTM hires her on a regular basis. Versatile singer: Great American Songbook to 1970s pop to Latin music. And a far better than average lounge pianist. Much fun.' u"Tell Mama Not to come hereI came here with 2 friends during a girls day in the city.The good: the wait staff was courteous and friendly. The seafood in my seared seafood trio pasta really wasn't seared but it was cooked well. \xa0The ceasar salad was pretty good.The bad: It took about 20 minutes for our entrees to come. Friend #1 found a hair in her demi-glazed chicken the staff was apologetic and brought another dish about 10 mins later. \xa0All of our food had 0 seasoning which is absolutely unacceptable. It took a while for friend #2 to get her dessert.I won't be back." u"This place is located on restaurant row which means its touristy and lives up to the expectation that a touristy spot will be mediocre at best.My party of 4 came on a Sunday evening to the piano bar. I must point out that the service and staff was very friendly.The bar itself was a tight space. The tables were tiny and extremely closely spaced. Its impossible to get out of your seat wiithout hitting or disturbing something or someone. We came when it wasn't busy/crowded so it was nice. However at that time only the bartender was there and we had to keep getting up for drinks and food (basically serving ourselves). The place was clean but very dark. The piano music was lovely. The particular performer had a beautiful voice and she was opened to requests however only from her iPad song selection.The food and drinks were disappointingThe menu they have posted online has changed a little. Skip the burgers they taste worse than McDonald's burgers. The chicken skeweres were dry. Skip the cheesecake.The guacamole brie tiramisu and fries were decent Drinks low quality and very sugary" u'Great ambience NYC crowd which is nice. Piano player and a cabaret in the back. Gotta find out what THATSabout!' u'From m the moment I walked up the gentleman at the door was very courteous and friendly. I was seated at an appropriate table and was greeted by my server in a very pleasant manner. I ordered the braised short ribs and market salad. I decided to have a cocktail and chose the "sexy mamma" it was perfect and refreshing. The salad came and was artfully plated fresh and tasty. The main dish was sever in a very timely manner and was melt in your mouth delicious! The device was impeccable and the atmosphere intimate and lovely I would highly recommend this little gem for any occasion!' u"Randomly walked in don't tell mama after dinner with friends on a Friday night. The decor here looks like the Titanic and feels like in that era. A good variety of people it is not a specific type of bar. Great for group especially for music lovers. All the people in the bar could sing: the waitress the piano man the cashier and etc. The line up for today is Jerry. We love the singer Tara Martinez!!! Fantastic voice.not to exaggerate I mean they could all go to the auditions for X factor. The sweet potato Fries is a must try! For drinks: Sexy mama the funny girl a chorus line martini wicked witch and Blue man balls are great cocktails. No for Mormon Mai Tai it tastes like cough syrup... Overall amazing experience!!!! Recommended to everyone!!!" u"Stopped by for dinner with friends tonight we're sitting in the dining area. The drinks were good the food was just fine - not the best and for my opinion overpriced. The service was good too I have to admit we were in a rush and got everything in time. But I didn't get one thing. They automatically charged us 20% service charge. So I paid 55$ for lobster ravioli 1 drink and a bread. Yes be ready to pay for bread.C'mon guys if I speak foreign language it doesn't mean I won't give you tips. I understand those things but it was the first time and not a pleasant one.Will not return." u"Wonderful entertainment! Was looking for a good piano bar in NYC for a Tuesday night! This place was perfect! Great service food and performance!! No cover charge!! Definitely will be returning when I'm back in the city!!" u'Absolutely love "Don\'t tell Mama"! Was expecting a normal piano bar but this bar hit it out of the ball park! The waiters and bartenders join in with the music and offer Broadway quality performances to the enthusiastic patrons. Particularly recommend this bar for musical theatre fans. Will definitely be back to grab another "Sexy Mama" cocktail!' u'We were in NYC few just a few days and organized an impromptu "family reunion." We had heard about Don\'t Tell Mama the location was perfect (we had tickets for a show down the block for that night) and were able to get a reservation for 10 the same day. While there are several venues in this one location we stayed in the front dining room only.Our server brought the main menu. Someone in our party asked about the price fixed menu and the server brought those out too. For $24 you get a soup or salad an entree and a dessert. Seemed a good deal especially in a midtown Manhattan restaurant. I decided to go with the price fixed meal. I chose the gazpacho to start the tilapia for a main course and a brownie for dessert. It\'s been a while since I\'ve had gazpacho so I have no expertise as to what a good bowl should taste like. However the gazpacho I ate here was just bland and very unexciting. Not bad but much less than the gazpacho I remember from my past. The presentaion of the talapia was very nice. But the presentation was the best part of the dish. Also very bland and unexciting. The brownie was the highlight of the meal. Moist and delish. My wife had the chicken marsala. Now that was a tasty dish (only $18). My brother-in-law had another of the price fixed dishes the coucous. It ended up less than half eaten. He described it as greasy and bland.The service was excellent. If only all of the food was up to that standard. I was torn between 3 stars (for the food) and 4 stars (for the food and ambiance) but since the food quality is the most important item in the rating I ended up rounding down.' u"Not having reservations on a Saturday night of a holiday weekend was a huge bummer using open table we stumble upon this place and heard from a friend who lived here they do some singing and what not while there. Unfortunately when we got there with our reservations it was only for the restaurant area and not for the entertainment boo. We were seated quickly and never got the complimentary bread/olive oil. The service was quite shotty the whole night. For my entree I had the Demi glazed chicken. It wasn't the best chicken I've had the flavor wasn't bad but it wasn't outstanding either. The potatoes were super mushy - not great and the vegetables were just ick. My partner had the steak and that also was not great. For the price of food and drinks I would not recommend this place. Overpriced and not great service. There are way better options out there." u'Love this place so much! \xa0Always entertained and amazed by the talent on staff and as patrons.' u"I really hesitated to make this review as the place is a HOOT and I don't want it to get overrun! We were sent by a new friend Beth who sometimes performs there I think... There is a cover for several earlier shows. We went after a play about 10:45 pm. There was no cover but there was still a 2 drink minimum.....who drinks only 2?? ;). Any way we were seated at the bar close to the stage as all the tables were full and it is a small place. We ordered no food. WE HAD AN ABSOLUTE BLAST! The main piano guy was great and energetic. All the waiters waiters and even the bartender sang......the talent level puts American Idol to shame!! These people are SO amazingly talented! I hope they all obtain whatever goal they are seeking. We will NEVER miss a visit when in town which is usually only once a year.....but it's now on our permanent list of things to do!" u"This review is for the Piano Bar. We walked in late on a holiday Sunday after a show and were immediately greeted. The venue was packed but luckily for us four seated had just opened up at the bar.The staff is friendly and super efficient multitasking by singing while mixing drinks or serving tables. They are amazing and talented and very entertaining.The atmosphere is pure and unfiltered fun. Everyone is laughing amd singing along and it's just all around a great time.The food surprised us in a good way. We had a turkey club and it was pretty good for a bar snack. The drinks are a little pricey but completely in line with this side of town.We'd definitely go back it was just too much fun." u"Great spot to hang out and listen to talented staff and piano. \xa0Didn't eat but if u want to relax this place is great" u'I can not rave much more about this place. I love it. My spouse and I have been going to this place for so many years and we love taking new people here. For a great time after dinner or before your last bar definitely come here and sing a long. Amazing singers and patrons you meet. I came here on Friday and brought my friends who have never been here and ended up meeting 3 other young people and all got along well sang made new friends. Reserve in advance best times to go is after 9pm. It seems like everyone is more alive at this time.' u'I dined with my girlfriend during weekend. The waiter took 40 mins to serve crab cakes and it was just ok. \xa0However the main entree Chicken Scarpello is very good and so the Chilean Sea Bass. \xa0There were a couple who were very loud but overall I liked the ambience after they left. \xa0I ordered a non alcoholic beer by mistake and they are courteous to exchange for a regular one.' u"If only I could give this place 0 stars... (By the way this review is for the singing concert)I went here for a friend's concert with my sister. I was told it would be $15 for entrance per person which I thought was a little pricey but whatever. What outraged me the most is how they forced us to buy 2 drinks minimum per person. Which I thought was fine... Until I found out the drinks were 6.50 PER DRINK. So my sister and I ended up spending $64 (including tip and tax). By no means am I a millionaire so $64 just for a 30 minute concert and 2 drinks (that were really small) was a dread to pay. I felt robbed of my money at the end of the day.I advise you guys not to go here. The waiters try to make you buy more drinks without your consent." u"Came for a show. $20 cover $13 for ginger and seltzer $10 automatic tip for party of three. Great show! Sticker shock at the resulting bill. But it's midtown" u'Great food and drinks really enjoyed the lamb chops & lobster tail . be sure to try the drinks "Rocky Balboa" \xa0(Yes I\'m a Philly Native) & the "sexy Lady" (vodka based) Food is very reasonably priced']
50.Shorty’s,[u"NYC isn't the city of brotherly love but Shorty's does a great job bringing some of that love (in food form) to The Big Apple. I've been frequenting this joint for a few years now as it's arguably the best place to grab a Philadelphia-style cheesesteak and other Phillie favorites. Sunday night I stopped in here with one of my buddies to grab a quick bite. It's not a big place but makes the most of its space. Want a good craft beer? They have a great selection and if you come on a weeknight they're all $4. I went with the Dogfish Head Festina Peche which was a nice light Weisse-style brew. We then split cheese fries a cheesesteak wit whiz and onions and my personal favorite the roast pork special with sharp provolone broccoli rabe and a side of au jus. The fries were crispy with plenty of cheese whiz melted on top. The steak was nicely chopped and the whiz mixes in well with it. As for the roast pork it's a sandwich you really can't find in New York and compared to the ones I've sampled in Philadelphia it does a great job complementing the style and flavor. Oh and the bread? The bread is perfect especially because it's shipped in from PA which helps make the meal a true Phillie experience.Overall this is a real gem in New York City especially if you like grub from Philadelphia. The only downside? The Philadelphia sports they play on the tv screens!" u"A group of us were having a good time. Eating and drinking talking and laughing that was until the bouncer shows up and rudely tells one of us we have to move because we're blocking the isle. We were squeezed in barely covering the isle and definitely not blocking space. Even saw one of the employees had said you guys are good your not even covering the isle. People were able to walk in thru with no problem. I don't understand how there's bouncer or door guy whatever his position is called but stands by the To Go Window often and on his phone. How is that for safety? If he needs to ID someone that should happen at the door as soon as a customer walks in. Not when that customer is already seated. Door guy needs to learn people skills. What a turn off at this location." u"Ordered from here this evening and was sent a completely wrong order. I called into the store as soon as I opened the bag. Was sent beef I informed the store that I didn't and could not eat it. The young lady I spoke with admitted the mistake was hers because the didn't do something correctly. Seems the kitchen was busy. Understanding these things happen I asked what can be done since this was supposed to be my dinner. Long story short here I sit with food I physically can not eat $23 poorer and no options. I will NEVER darken the doors of this restaurant again. After speaking with the manager Eddie he said basically the delivery guys are done I guess we can give you a free sandwich tomorrow. \xa0As if I'd be stupid enough to risk this foul up again? Right... unlikely. \xa0And how would he even know? All he asked for was my name and phone number. \xa0Granted not ky full name cause how many people in HK could possibly be named J. And how many peope in Manhattan have a CO phone number? Understood Shorty's lessons learned. For my part I'll pass this information within the charity I run servicing roughly 10000 people here in the tri-state area. Maybe not all will avoid you but if just 15% do that's more than enough. I do hope 23 dollars was worth all of this. This is all I'll say now since I've been deprived of food I haven't the energy to continue the review of this tasty place that happens to have horrid people working it." u"Yes the bar is sticky but that's just the crappy varnish. Other than that this is an amazing bar with only the occasional creep. And we can't say enough about James!!!! He is a god among bartenders. A delightful ball of enthusiasm and stories. A titan among the meager masses. And good looking to boot. Come for the beer. Stay for the sass." u"Must say my family's from South Philly and I've had my share of good cheesesteaks sandwiches.However no cheesesteak beats Shorty's veggie sandwich! I love the broccoli rabe marinara and provolone combo - and it definitely has a spicy kick to it. And THE BREAD. Definitely the taste and texture of the amoroso hoagie rolls down in the 215. The sandwich is stuffed. Crab fries are bomb too - brings me back to eating at Chickie and Pete's. Delivery is always early and Shorty's has become my go-to delivery place.I haven't tried their Cheesesteak sandwiches as there's no need to - the veggie sandwich is consistently good." u"Who needs Philly when you have Shorty's?I was surprised at how good the cheesesteak here was. I got one with wiz and fried onions. Also got a side of the Italian fries (basically fries with Italian seasoning and lots of grated cheese). Being a French fry fiend I LOVED these. The fries ($6) pushed the meal from reasonable to overpriced lunch (cheesesteak on its own is $12). Expensive lunch for $18 but on the other hand I did have lots of leftovers. I would definitely go back." u"Cute place. Food was good for what it was. Nothing calling me back there. It's more bar than restaurant. Friendly service." u"Simply delicious!!!Me&my boyfriend were starving on our first night in New York and didn't know where to eat. We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We got the classic Philly cheesesteak and it was amazing - the meat the bread - all of it!!! I never ate a Philly cheesesteak like this before. We also got cheese fries. They were delicious as well. We went there on a Sunday night when they have specials after 7pm for chosen cocktails @ $5  which I think is a really good price. Highly recommend the place to any one but make sure you are hungry because the portions are big!!" u"I would have to say the best thing here is def their roast pork. Good cheesesteaks for Manhattan but there's other things on the menu I would go for rather than the classic. The bread is perfect. Went to college in philly so I'm a harsh reviewer when it comes to my steak bundles of joy (how I say cheesesteaks). If you haven't had it go for the roast pork special with hot peppers and dip that baby in some au ju and you will be a happy camper." u"For N.Y. cheesesteaks......I'd definately rate it a 5. \xa0Not nearly as good as some of the Philly joints.......but you don't have to drive hours to get to Shorty's either. \xa0I tried the traditional Cheesesteak with onions and wiz on a visit and it did not disappoint. \xa0On another visit I tried the Cheesesteak with prov which was also good. \xa0The Italian fries were crispy and made just right.Mozzerella triangles were nothing special. Biggest disappointment came from the roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe. \xa0Roast pork was dry and nothing like you'd get at the Reading Terminal Market.But hey........the staff was friendly at both locations and it had a fun vibe to it.So if you're looking for something remotely comparable to a real philly cheesesteak........I'd say this one beats out 99 Miles Carls and Tads. \xa0Definitely worth a try." u'My boyfriend and I come here all the time. Very chill spot. Nice to watch some sports games. Their Philly cheesesteaks are the f**king bomb! The staff is nice and fast. Definitely recommend coming here for lunch or a drink during some sports games.' u"I have ordered from this place since they first opened and have been a pretty loyal customer but I've just had it with attitude of their delivery guys. \xa0Food is good but the service is so poor. \xa0I resisted writing a review the first 2 times it happen but it happened again today. \xa0I have had it. \xa0Antonio today calls me telling me come down to get my food. I calmly tell him that I am in a meeting and cannot. \xa0He belligerently replies come down or else I won't get my food. \xa0I ask him to please come up because I cannot leave my meeting again. \xa0He proceeds to tell me he doesn't have ID so he can't come up. \xa0This seems to be a line they use frequently as 2 other delivery guys from Shorty's said the same thing. \xa0I excuse myself from the meeting (CEO was not happy) and I go down and find that he isn't even at my building?!?!? \xa0I have to go outside and wait 5 mins before he comes. \xa0I tell him he wasn't even there and he is clearly BS**ting me. \xa0He continues to be belligerent and give me some choice words. \xa0I tell him I give tip so that I can get the door-to-door service. \xa0He continues to ignore my words and tells me off. \xa0It is like talking to a bratty teenager.I have come to the conclusion this is the way Shortys runs its business. \xa0They hire some pretty suspect guys that don't care or are carrying out the management's wishes. Whatever it is I've had enough. \xa0 Because of me my entire company loves Shortys and on a number of occasions I have influenced my CEO to order for our entire company....enough is enough. They clearly don't care. \xa0It comes down to simply respect this business does not cherish that. \xa0To make sure I'm not being emotional I spoke with others in my company and found when they order individually they have also received the same level of service. \xa0Yelp friends if service matter to you then order at your own risk." u'Don\'t order from the website. I ordered at 1:07 got TWO confirmation emails that they received my order and that it would be delivered around 2:07. Okay that\'s fine I\'ll wait the hour. 2:30 rolls around and I still have not received my order. I call them up saying I still haven\'t gotten anything any their response was "oh we don\'t have the sauce you requested." "oh sorry our internet was down." \xa0Just the dumbest excuses I can hear the employee trying to think of. \xa0Regardless Carl\'s cheesesteaks & Gary\'s steaks trump Shorty\'s. Now that they took the broad street bully sandwich off the menu I have no desire to order from here again.' u'Absolute loved the sandwich. I love Philly cheesesteaks so much so I will drive to Philly but this place has made things much easier. I got the steak philly sandwich with everything on it. At first my order was not correct but they were Bernice about changing it. All in all great place and def going back' u"Our first night in New York we went to Shorty's. After a long day of travel my husband wanted a beer. We found Shorty's while walking down the street by our hotel. We got a cheesesteak with wiz and onions. It was a little small but the flavor was excellent. You don't get much better unless you go to Philly. My husband ordered one of the Amber ales on their drink menu which was a nice smooth beer. The kids got the chicken strips and said they liked how crispy the batter was." u"What a great place to hang out with a few friends after work. Their happy hour specials are awesome. From 4pm-7pm:$4 any fries $4 draft and $5 shots.Cheesesteak here are pretty darn good. A bit too drippy for me but it packs a ton of flavor. One thing I'd stay away from are the peppers here. Not only will it cost you extra $$ it'll have you chugging beer after beer. So avoid it at all cost if you're cheap like me.At such a prime location (near Time Square) there's not much more you can ask for." u"Not as good a Phil's Steaks - the food truck. I was craving a Philly and wanted to try this place. Glad I did." u"My second favorite cheese steak joint in New York City. But it's a pretty fierce lineup so in this case number two is a really good thing. This is THE place to be during happy hour where all the beers are just four bucks and they have various food specials going on as well. Just 10 blocks away from Penn Station means it's not too much of a walk to catch my train afterwards though I am a little jealous of the folks who can just go down the block to catch their bus back to New Jersey. Speaking of the beers it's a great selection of craft beer from across the country and one of the few places in the city that I can count on to have Jai Alai from Cigar City Brewing in Tampa on hand year round. As far as the sandwiches they are a little pricy with the starting price of $11 and then an up charge for each extra thing you put on the sandwich. The sandwiches generally are well prepared and the homemade bread that they use is pretty good- though being from Pennsylvania myself it's no substitute for s proper roll baked in Philly and delivered the same day. Fries leave a little to be desired as they are frozen with some type of batter on them- would personally prefer crinkle cut fries- that's what the Philly steak restaurant I ate at as a kid had- guess it's personal preference." u"3.5/3.75 stars. Rounding up because when I come to Shorty's I'm among my people. Something really really atrocious would have to happen for me to round down on any place affiliated with Philly. Well something really really atrocious did happen while I was here but it had nothing to do with Shorty's itself. Just the Eagles' ineptitude.Came here to watch the Eagles-Redskins game this past Sunday and it was all kinds of crowded. People were unintentionally sitting on me at times. Not exactly optimal. My small star deduction is due to this given that the Shorty's in Flatiron is significantly more spacious. While we did get seats they can be a blessing and a curse here - you can rest your legs but run the risk of being blocked by many bobbing heads. This all said people are fairly considerate if you ask them to shift positions slightly. On Sundays we're all here for the same purpose - to hopefully watch our Birds win. So we can't *really* get annoyed at anyone because we're all quite literally on the same team. So despite it being nearly impossible to navigate around in this place I didn't find myself running into any rudeness. Now onto the good. Most TVs are showing the Eagles when they're playing - pretty standard. On this particular Sunday the Giants were playing at the same time so they had that game up as well. My semi-educated guess is that NFC East match-ups will always be shown over less relevant games. So if for some reason you're a lost Giants Cowboys or Washington fan (not getting into the name debate right now...) you might be able to find your game on here. But I have no idea why you'd come to an Eagles bar then unless you're a complete masochist. While I can't speak to their cheesesteaks I actually got a breakfast sandwich (I know I know very weird...but I hadn't eaten breakfast yet so...) here on Sunday and it was super tasty. Broccoli rabe egg and provolone on a very fresh roll. Simple and delicious. Also - only six bucks! Not too shabby. Unlike the Flatiron Shorty's you should not expect a server to come by asking to take your order - it's simply too cramped for that. So order at the bar and someone will bring you your food promptly. Done and done. Yum and yum. And if you do want a cheesesteak they've got an impressive variety to choose from here - if I see Philly fans genuinely enjoying cheesesteaks at a New York establishment they're bound to be good." u"Went back there again last night and got their steak nachos. Despite the awesomeness of their buffalo chicken the nachos was a disappointment. Portion is big enough to feed two hungry people and it was loaded with guac and sour cream. The tomatoes in the guac didn't taste very fresh though. And very little cheese was laying there-cold and kinda pathetic. Think I'll stick to their cheesesteaks and wings but NO NO to the nachos."]
110.Sushi Seki Hell’s Kitchen,[u"My friends and i had lunch here for restaurant week. It was not busy because of the location perhaps. This restaurant is pretty spacious. The d\xe9cor offered a Zen feeling.I had the nine piece sushi and chef roll. The sushi was good. RW deal pretty good. For dessert i has the matcha crem brulee which was really good. It was the perfect portion if you don't want to overeat. Overall i had a good experience here for restaurant week. I felt like it was good value. The rw menu offers a variety." u"The food is alright. The service is slow though! They definitely need more waiters!!!!! It took forever to get everything like menus.I came here for the matcha cocktail! It's pretty nice it's made of rum and matcha. The matcha flavor is strong. Not bad! My friends also get Sakura cocktail which is based on sake. Lychee one is petty standard one. The drinking menu list is pretty long. My friends think oysters are good. For happy hour around 2-3 per one. I got miso cod for my entree. I like it even though the size is really small for $29. We also shared some other appetizers such as beef sth (with scallions) tofu salad (something healthy) crispy rice with crab (almost all crispy rice like Guo ba in Chinese\u9505\u5df4). For dessert we got matcha creme br\xfbl\xe9e which I like. They also have special fixed menu which is much cheaper and omakase." u"I used to go to the UES location - especially for omakase - but it's always so crowded and difficult to get a reservation at. Didn't realize SS opened an HK location. Same great quality and what feels like twice the space including a second floor. Everything was fresh and tasty - sushi and cooked foods included. The spicy scallop roll and black miso cod were my favorite. And at a fraction of Gari/Nobu prices.Come!! I don't want this place to close." u"Sushi Seki was alright. \xa0The ambiance was slightly sterile and the food selection was not very exciting. \xa0We ordered some small dishes and some sushi. \xa0Everything was decent but you can tell it's not top notch sushi based on the mediocre rice underneath each sashimi. \xa0And it's pricey. \xa0For $50 a person we could have easily been satisfied in many many other choices in Manhattan." u"Food here is pricey but it's pretty good! I would give the food a 4 but the service was a definite 5. I came here with a group of 7 and anyone who's ever dined in the city knows it's rare to have a restaurant seat you before until your entire party is there. Not only did sushi seki seat us right away before the rest of our party arrived they even offered us a private room! \xa0We took off our shoes to enter the private room and they had slip on crocs that you could borrow instead of going through the hassle of putting on your shoes when you went to the bathroom.Half of my party got the 6 course meal which was quite filling! \xa0I opted to get the agedashi tofu and Chilean seabass. The tofu was amazing. I would definitely get that again. It was nice and crispy on the outside and silky smooth on the inside. The dashi complemented it perfectly. The Chilean sea bass was pretty good but one piece that I got was a little on the dry side. I got a yuzu cocktail. Not only was it beautiful but it was delicious. This cocktail is for the true yuzu lover. It wasn't overly sweet and had a nice tangy flavor. It's not for those who dislike sour but was just right for me. I tried a few pieces of sushi and sashimi. While the flavors were great and there was absolutely no need for soy sauce I'm not sure how fresh the fish was. However I may be too spoiled by recently going to Japan and eating sushi straight from the fish market.The overheard us talking about it being my husbands birthday and brought a complimentary green tea creme br\xfbl\xe9e in addition to 3 extra Mochi ice cream. The waitress and waiter were all super sweet and informative and never rushed us. \xa0I would definitely go back!!" u'The sushi rolls are delicious; however they are small in stature about the size of a quarter.The ambience is appealing. The staff is very attentive. But please note that if you do not have a party of six or more you will not be seated in the main dining room. Overall I will give it four stars because the sushi is impeccable despite the small size. Please put this place on your list if you are in New York City.' u"Ambiance and decor: 5Food: 3Service: 4Price: 2This location is absolutely gorgeous spacious and beautifully lit - the opposite of a lot of other New York hotspots. The ambiance makes you really excited for your meal. The servers are attentive without being too pushy and generally pretty fast. Unfortunately the food was just ok and very overpriced for the quality. We ordered a variety of nigiri a few appetizers and salads a couple rolls and a carafe of sake. The rolls were incredibly disappointing with slightly burnt fried soft shell crab and tiny portions. All of the nigiri was fine but at $5+ per piece it's ridiculously overpriced. The most disappointing item we got was the seaweed salad with onion dressing which is mostly a leafy salad with a tiny bit of seaweed and an incredibly strong onion/pungent dressing that was almost inedible. Maybe I'm just going to the wrong sushi spots in NYC but none of the places I've tried thus far have impressed me." u"Upon entering Sushi Seki i was just blown away. The contemporary decor is truly beautiful. This establishment is bi-level. Lunch is served only on the bottom level and the upper level is open for dinner. \xa0Located on the bottom level is a long cocktail bar which serves artisanal cocktails as well as sake and Japanese whiskey and beer. On the main floor there is a communal table which looks really neat and there is also a Kappo bar in front of the open kitchen. Upstairs you will get more of the authentic Japanese feel. The upper level features a sake and whiskey bar sushi bar a few tables on the terrace over looking Hell's Kitchen and the coolest of all tatami rooms! The tatami room is traditional and offers a private dining experience.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Upon arriving I asked Ryan the amazing mixologist to recommend a good drink on the cocktail menu while I waited for my friend. He recommended the Yuzu. It was perfectly garnished served in a ceramic cup and really refreshing. Cocktails run from $13-$19 but they are quality drinks. Now on to my favorite part...the FOOD. Off of the special menu I ordered the mushroom soup with black truffle and the crab scallop and avocado on crispy rice. The mushroom soup was rich and delightful. The crab scallop and avocado with crispy rice was served on a shell. It was really really good. My friend and I ordered the spicy oyster roll and spicy tuna roll. Each order comes with 6 pcs. The spicy oyster roll was amazing!! I couldn't stop eating it. The rolls were so tasty that you don't even need soy sauce. Sushi Seki definitely uses quality and fresh ingredients. The price is really great for the quality of food they serve.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 I will be coming back for more food and more cocktails. I heard they are launching their happy hour specials on Thursdays and Fridays soon. I cannot wait! Not to mention the staff is so friendly and warm and the place is pristine.Sushi Seki gets a 5 star for ambiance food cocktails and service!" u"It was a disappointing dinner and here is why.I walked into this newly opened Japanese restaurant - well decorate spacious friendly staff got its own Japanese sake and whiskey bar - looking to enjoy a good dinner but it failed.None of the dishes I tasted met my expectation:Agedashi Tofu: it was too firm there's no air at all inside the fried tofuSpicy scallop roll: there's no scallop in itTempura roll: not well fried and the shrimp was tinyUni sushi: good but it's Uni you can't fail Uni Miso cod: good fresh fish but way too sweetSea bass: again good fish but the black bean sauce messed up the dish it was too saltyTea: how can a Japanese restaurant not serve its traditional tea but rather have some tea list that charges you $7 for a cup of tea?Overall I might still give the restaurant a try but this place is not anywhere near the level of 15 east yasuda morimoto azabu etc." u"Cute little place in hells kitchen! Loved the interior and staffs were all very nice. We ordered omakase which was around $160/person. It is pricey but also was very good. Interesting chef's choices!" u"With the demise of the old Firebird joint in restaurant row I was eager to see who would come and take over the copious amount of real estate left behind by the Russian stalwart. \xa0In comes Sushi Seki .. in all of its east side glory in the Theater District.To be honest I was a bit skeptical. \xa0Why open a new Japanese restaurant on a street that's full of high level established names (Sushi of Gari 46) .. new entrants (Saki Bar Hagi 46) and pretenders (Osha)? \xa0Clearly the owners feel there is demand for high-quality Japanese food here and for the most part Sushi Seki does not disappoint.The new digs are a big departure from the days when we saw the ornate furnishings of the old Firebird restaurant that made diners think they were taking a trip back in time to the days when the Czar ruled Russia. \xa0Now it's been totally overhauled with the sublime neo-Japanese decor that defines to many new restaurants. \xa0The overall experience - from the huge bar featuring their highly touted cocktails - to the spacious seats - to the simple/clean sushi bar in the back - it all screams modern chic.I decided to give the pre-theater menu a try. \xa0For $42 dollars they offered a simple four course menu with a few choices for each part of the meal. \xa0I opted to start with the agedashi tofu which featured two small pieces of finely fried tofu paired with some warm tempura sauce. It was tasty and simple. \xa0I followed that up with the snow pea salad with house ginger dressing. \xa0This dish was fine and the fresh crispy snow peas really paired well with the savory dressing. \xa0My only qualm was how the dish could have been better had the peas been mixed more with the dressing to accentuate the flavor but this dish should suit those with light palates very well.Since I was in the mood for protein I opted for the beef teriyaki as my entree. \xa0The quality of the meat was fine but I was expecting a better cut. \xa0The meat was a bit more rubbery in texture than I expected and the sauce was also underwhelming. \xa0Given the type of dish it was .. I was expecting the flavors to stand out more. \xa0In this case it didn't feel like the meat and sauce worked in harmony. \xa0The meal wrapped up with my order of red bean panna cotta. \xa0I enjoyed this dish a lot as the sublime custard paired well with the rich red bean flavor. \xa0Again this could have used a bit more red bean to help create more harmony between the milk and azuki flavors but for the most part it was delightful. \xa0One theme seemed to resonate with me based on my initial experience. \xa0While the quality of the ingredients and the flavors were there - there seemed to be instances when the flavors didn't jive completely and certain elements that should have been more robust or pronounced didn't materialize. \xa0The service here was polite but spotty. \xa0At times I had multiple come and ask me the same question. \xa0Other times I had to flag people for attention. \xa0It didn't seem very even to me but given it's a new restaurant these things may take time to shake out. \xa0I will come back to try more of their menu (and sushi) on a future visit but for now I still have to give the edge to Sushi of Gari 46 as the best Japanese joint on restaurant row. \xa0But I do think this place has a lot of potential to take the top spot if they work on some nuances.PS - I did also get to try their tempura udon. \xa0It was good but not remarkable. \xa0The soup base was the best part of that dish ... being light and mostly flavorful." u"I have been hearing about sushi seki for quite sometime and then one day walked by this new location. I decided it was time to try what many of my friends have been raving about. This spot is top notch from the space to the service and of course the food. We got a huge platter of sushi and indulged. We also each got a couple rolls. One my favorite rolls the toro and scallion was phenomenal. The spicy scallop roll which apparently they are known for was also amazing. The drinks here are top notch as well. It's an expensive place but worth it if you want to experience some of the better sushi in NYC." u'Great service"" food"" presentation"" drinksEverything was delightful! My friend and I sat at the sushi bar. You could chose from traditional tables or booths where you sit on the floor. We were greeted with a warm washcloth. We stupidly ordered sushi with salmon belly- it was good and smokey but not worth 18 dollars! Everything else was tasty the fish was very fresh but everything tasted a bit smokey.' u"My friends and I came here for dinner before catching a show on Broadway. We made a last minute reservation had to call and make it a little later but had no trouble at all changing the time. The hostess checked out coats for us and then showed us to our table which was upstairs. They have really nice private dining rooms that seat about 6 they definitely look like something I'd want to try.I ordered the miso soup to start and then my boyfriend and I shared a plate of sashimi. We had yellowtail medium fatty tuna king salmon eel and another one I can't remember. They were all so fresh and delicious! Our waiter Frank was incredibly helpful answering all our questions explaining the specials and giving recommendations. He mentioned that they just recently opened a few months ago and I'm very impressed with the place.We mentioned how pleased we were with the service and they brought complimentary hot green tea! Which hit the spot since it was below 10 degrees that night.Great job Sushi Seki! Will definitely be returning next time I'm in NYC!" u"I used to go to their UES location regularly as I live in the neighborhood but it got almost impossible to get a table there so I am happy about the new HK location which is super convenient for a pre-theater dinner. \xa0I came here twice within a month - once for omakase at the sushi bar and another time for sushi special at a table. \xa0The omakase was as good as I remembered from UES - rice was perfectly cooked and all nigiris were interesting. \xa0Inside the sushi bar felt more casual and lacked the traditional discipline you would typically see at a traditional sushi bar which was a slight disappointment for me. \xa0Sushi special was also good however it obviously lacked the freshness of omekase and some pieces felt dry. \xa0The appetizers were hit and miss - I would stick to the deep fried items like chicken karaage or ebi shinjo. \xa0The panna cotta and green team creme brulee were spectacular. \xa0I really wanted to lick the bowls. \xa0I would definitely go back for pre-theater. \xa0I love the fact that it's much easier to get a table even in the last minute." u'One of the best sake bar in the City is "hidden" on the 2nd Floor. \xa0The sake selection was masterfully put together and will challenge even the most discerning aficionados. The overall decor attention to details and design are sure to get your attention as well.' u"Omg best place for sushi and sashimi. I went here to have one drink and some appetizers before heading out for main dinner. My friend and I ordered a platter for two which costs $35.00...all the fish slices and oysters are so fresh and well seasoned. Put it this way I don't even like raw fish but this is amazing. Five stars all the way. And they chilled my glass before serving prosecco...Will be back for more." u'Great cocktail menu. Tried and loved the Yuzu. Two floors of sushi! And a bar on both floors!' u"Been going to the 1st avenue location for years and always had a good to excellent omikase dining experience. With clients I decided to try the 46th St locale and left with huge regrets and and even bigger check. We did omikase for 4 1-2 drinks each and 2-3 apps=$850!!Ok so it was outrageously expensive I could be ok with that IF the sushi wasn't so dry flavorless uninspired basic. Blech! It was a 4 course omikase with 4 pieces per course. Not a truly great piece in the mix and explained poorly by an uninspired and uncaring server. Suffice to say I'll pass on all Seki's going forward. Since they expanded and are now a small chain the quality has sunk faster than an anchor. Many better options in the city but it's still sad to lose what was a good one. Bye Seki." u'Seriously this is such a beautiful spot with delicious food and amazing drinks. I went when it first opened and it was not super crowded and went again last night and it was about the same. Hoping people try this place out so it stays open!']
95.Kobeyaki,[u'The tuna tataki salad is the perfect item to satisfy a Japanese craving with something healthy. The creamy ginger dressing that comes with it is excellent- similar to the traditional carrot ginger dressing served in Japanese restaurants but creamy!I also had the beef teriyaki bowl. The beef was good- not dry as you would expect in a typical lunch spot. I would compare the teriyaki to the kind you get in mall food courts but I mean that in a good way.' u'Came around 12:30 during lunch time rush. The line to order moved quite quickly and so did the line for picking up food. However that "waiting corner" is a mess. It\'s super crowded and awkwardly close to the condiments. I was constantly shifting places so people could get their orders or so I wasn\'t in anyone\'s way.I got a shrimp bowl with brown rice and my sister got a pork bun/sandwich. Her pork bun was super flavorful but my shrimp bowl is another story. The veggies were okay but the shrimp was really bland and didn\'t taste like anything. My sister said the brown rice was pretty soft compared to other places though which is a good thing cause brown rice tends to be harder than white rice.Seating fills up quickly but people are in and out so we didn\'t have any trouble finding space.I would come again for the bun but not for the bowl.' u"Don't be intimidated by the lunch rush line it goes quickly. The place is clean and has a decent amount of seating for groups of 2-4.Soft Shell Crab Bun: Tasty! Just the right amount of crispiness spicy mayo goes PERFECTLY with it. You can get more mayo in the condiments area. Seemed small for its price point you'd get a better bang for your buck going with a bowl option but this is a nice detour from your usual lunches.Tempura Sweet Potato Fries: Also on point with the crispiness pretty good to try with their few sauce options but my favorite is still the spicy mayo.Would return to try one of their bowls." u"There are some serious staples in this establishment. Serious.Kobeyaki: a fast food Japanese joint serving anything but fast food. Watch out for the lunch crowd the line can easily be out the door and you could be in for a 20 minute wait. Well worth the wait? For some menu items yes.After ordering you're given a buzzer and once your order is ready it comes in a very sturdy brown bag. Perfect for the city that's always on-the-go. Noteable items:Udon Noodle Soup ($10) - shrimp tempura on the side with nori scallions tofu tempura flakes an abundant amount of udon and the pink colored fish cakes. What more can you love? Perfect amount for a filling lunch.Tuna Tataki Salad ($11) - avocado edamame a lovely blend of romaine cabbage cucumber & carrots topped with thinly sliced seared tuna. Their ginger dressing is probably the best tasting thing marrying this lovely salad together.Soft Shell Crab Bun ($12) - actually the best thing on this menu. Fried soft shell crab a generous scoop of crabmeat a mix of Japanese mayo unagi sauce and spicy mayo topped with Bahn Mi like vegetables perfectly pickled and adds a nice texture.I'd avoid the sushi there's other much better (maybe even cheaper) places you can find your California Roll. (Psst. check out Wasabi on 40th & 7th)" u"I'm always incredibly satisfied when coming to Kobeyaki! It runs a little on the expensive side as you have to order everything individually but I Don't mind paying a few extra bucks for good food. The beef burger was juicy and flavorful and my veggie udon bowl was packed with vegetables - I had so many left overs I could have probably split it into another two meals. My boyfriend loved his crispy sweet potato tempura fries and my miso soup was light flavorful and refreshing. We also got a veggie roll that my boyfriend devoured despite claiming to not be a vegetable fan - the rolls are really large but fall apart really easily. It's packed on weekends and during rush hour but for a 7 pm Monday dinner there were no lines and a decent amount of empty tables." u"Kobeyaki was recommended to me by a friend of mine. We decided to come here after work for a quick bite. I quickly decided that I wanted to know what a Japanese style kobe burger would taste like. Also saw that the fries were very highly rated so I ordered that as a side. The Kobe burger was nothing spectacular and it definitely lost some points in the flavor department. I did however enjoy the texture of the burger itself. Between the soft ciabatta bread and crunchy coleslaw it definitely had the works of an amazing burger. I felt as if the burger meat itself was unseasoned. It also felt as if it was missing something. Maybe it could have used a few pickles. The spicy mayo was good but I would've liked some more of it. The fries are the saving grace of this review. It is rare enough to find sweet potato fries but to find sweet potato fries that aren't soggy or overly oily is near impossible. The potato fries here were excellent. Perfectly crisp and still maintained that sweet soft potato on the inside. I do regret ordering the burger but I would definitely order the fries again. Maybe this time I'll let my friend order first and copy whatever she gets." u"At first I didn't want to get the soft shell crab burger because the picture showed the crab's legs and I found that a bit creepy. But made the jump and it was great!! No legs either. Also ordered the tempura sweet potato fries. Those were yummy but made me feel more unhealthy than eating regular sweet potato fries. Appreciated the plethora of sauces they had!! The star of the show was the spicy mayo. The wasabi mayo helped my friend clear her sinuses though." u"Y'all better off passing on this Asian fusion eatery. After having failed to make a last minute reservation at a nearby restaurant we decided to just find something on Yelp while walking towards Port Authority. We were getting near and I hadn't seen anything that caught my eye yet so we jumped in at the first site of a somewhat trendy modern-chic decorated down-to-earth joint that didn't have a bar (they do however sell alcohol... Anytime is a good time for sake indeed- but tonight I was trying my bet to pass on that since my liver has been cursing up a storm from Monday night).There was no line when we walked in. We both ordered the grilled chicken rice bowl. I didn't look at the menu close enough. Had I known they offered brown rice white rice udon and salad for the bowls I would've leaned towards getting a salad bowl. But the lady taking our order only asked whether we'd want white or brown rice. If they were out of the other two options I'd like that to be noted somewhere- verbally or physically. Nothing else on the menu really jumped out at me and with my gluten allergy burgers were out of the question. We took a 4 seater booth and stacked up on sauce - their sauce station game is strong. Spicy wasabi terriyaki ketchup (tastes like straight up ketchup to us) spicy mayo all on the pump like an upscale McDonalds for Asia and a bottle of sriracha. There's also heaps of wasabi and soy sauce patches. Grab a plastic cup from the cashier area if you're dining in to get some water.The buzzer rang and we leaped for the pick up station. Everything was swell until the food came out *sigh*. Totally meh. My face fell. The terriyaki sauce tasted like an even crappier quality than what supermarkets offer. With high sodium content (I drank a gallon after this tonight) but not much of any other flavor I was drowning the bowl with sriracha. Chicken pieces were lacing and the vegetables could've been cooked better (into softer pieces). I was nauseated after finishing 1/3rd of the bowl and gave up. If you can't do a grilled chicken bowl right I can't imagine what on the menu they can do right." u"we were looking for a place to get some lunch fast. so we came across this burger/Asian fusion eatery by our hotel. Kobeyaki has burgers rice bowls sushi rolls salads n soups. it's like an Asian fast food joint. u walk in n order at the counter pay n wait for your number to b up as u sit at a table. the shop is small n dim. if we walked faster we probably would've missed it. thank god I saw the Kobeyaki sign on the front window. during the lunch hour it gets pretty busy. the tables r all along the left side plus a couple in the front window facing out to the street. we had no idea what to order having never heard of this place or the food. I immediately saw a pic of their burger with soft shell crab n wanted it! (seriously can't say no to soft shell crab.) so we both got one n some sodas. Soft Shell Crab Bun : this burger would've been a dud if not for the saving grace of the spicy mayo. that mayo is legit. the burger itself is a normal size. not too small not too big. I was kinda disappointed in how it didn't come out looking like the one on the wall with all the legs protruding out. it was instead more like a round piece of crab. oh well." u"We needed somewhere nearby and quick for lunch. \xa0Prior to flying out to NY I had Kobeyaki bookmarked as it was nearish to our hotel. \xa0So why not? \xa0We hit the lunch rush but the line moves fast and tables turn around at a decent rate. \xa0Kobeyaki kind of seems like the Asian equivalent to Chipotle (minus the assembly line in front of you). \xa0You can choose from a rice bowl noodle bowl or salad format with your choice of protein or opt for a burger or sushi roll. \xa0He and I both got the teriyaki chicken bowl option but I opted for udon noodles and he got white rice. \xa0I totally forgot to say no edamame in mine as I do not care for them at all and was totally trying to avoid them when I was eating my dish. \xa0It came with all natural chicken breast edamame carrot scallions onion zucchini teriyaki sauce sesame seeds and yellow squash. \xa0After about 10 minutes our buzzer went off and the food was ready to eat. \xa0Not bad for about $10 in this pricey part of the city. \xa0Everything tasted pretty fresh and the chicken was moist. \xa0The noodles were fine but doesn't absorb any sauce like rice does so I noticed how over sauced my dish was because of this and a little on the salty side. \xa0I like how Kobeyaki also has an assortment of other items if you aren't feeling a rice or noodle bowl. \xa0I would have been adventurous and tried one of their fish offerings but I'm always a little cautious with ordering fish at restaurants and if I felt like getting my hands a little dirty I would have chose one of their burger options. \xa0I would choose Kobeyaki over Chipotle any day. \xa0It's fine for what it is but not a destination eatery." u'Love this place! Delicious burgers friendly staff and cozy environment. Great place to stop in and get some amazing grub for an affordable cost. True to the statement "Japanese Chipotle" (minus the e-coli).' u"Kobeyaki is freakin' awesome! This is my 2nd time here during my 4day visit here in NY & I am grateful I discovered this place. I am picky & a health nut ergo not easy to please me. Sushi & bowls with brown rice was the first hint of how they can accommodate such a difficult customer. The spider roll is fresh crunchy & a big portion (8 rolls peeps). The green salad had several slices of avocado. The spicy tuna burger is so yummy and also a big portion. Tempura sweet potato is not too breaded so it was okay (guilt food). And by the way our 2nd visit was a party of 10 & they still did not disappoint! Janet was extremely courteous and patient with us. She accommodated all our special request with a smile. Janet please do not change & you deserve a raise (she was working on June 29th at 7pm). This place has a reasonable price and the food is of great quality for a fast food. Please open up in LA Thanks again Janet!" u'I was pleasantly surprised by this place. \xa0I needed a place to eat quickly and had ramen and a roll. \xa0They were both pretty good for a quick serve place. \xa0The broth was satisfying and had generous serving pork. \xa0The roll was also fresh and tasted good. \xa0Not bad at all.' u'Solid quick takeout in midtown. Had the teriyaki bowl with chicken over udon.Very much enjoyed the mixed vegetables they add to their bowls and the overall dish was a well balanced teriyaki saltiness with a little sweet.' u"I had high expectations for this place because my friend had told me about it. I wouldn't say it was the worst but it definitely was disappointing. I got the kobeyaki salad - the fish was good but the lettuce was skimpy and the portion size was a lot smaller than it looked. I was definitely still hungry but didn't want to pay for another meal. My friend had a burger which was wrapped nicely and looked good and the sweet potato fries seemed okay too but again a little too thin and not filling enough. I came famished here after a long bus ride and I left feeling still hungry. Not the worst - but not nearly the best." u'First time at Kobeyaki! My friend from work insisted that we go here for lunch because she loves their food. \xa0I\'m not a huge fan of Asian food so I ordered what I thought would be the "safe option" the California Roll. I was not disappointed! My roll was huge and \xa0absolutely delicious! \xa0I can\'t wait to try other things on their menu.The one downside is that there isn\'t much seating in the restaurant so be ready to fight other people for tables.' u"Kobeyaki is one of my favorite go-to lunch spots but only for pickup via online ordering on their website (not available on Seamless/Grubhub). Until I used their online ordering service I didn't realize you could substitute meats in the soups (they don't make this clear in person) specify what you want/don't want in your sushi or how you want your meat/tuna cooked. It's not a particularly small location but there's never any seating during lunchtime and the line is always almost to the door during the lunch hour rush. It's definitely crowded even by Times Square/Theatre District standards. They've recently added a new interior door vestibule-type thing to prevent the cold air from coming in and they're down another seat because of it. \xa0If you do end up waiting on line their turnaround is pretty quick once you actually put your order in. It's usually chaos by the register though between the people picking up food waiting to order food and then people trying to get their sauces and utensils. I feel like they need to utilize that space better space rather than use part of it for seating for customers waiting for their orders. No one ever really ends up using it because their turnaround is pretty quick.I think their $8-9/item is pretty standard for the area but it's more fair here because of their portion size. \xa0Their udon and ramen soups have lasted me for two meals. My hands down favorite thing to order here is their tuna burger which I think is even better than tuna burgers I've had at upscale restaurants. I've also enjoyed their tofu veggie bowl - they separate the tofu so it doesn't get soggy. \xa0The chicken sandwich was pretty unimpressive though. One thing I don't get is why they have such huge to-go bags. I wish they'd just give a simple brown paper bag. They finaly got rid of the cardboard boxes that would go inside the bags making it even bigger. \xa0My half eaten lunch takes up tons of space in the work fridge. Plus their fries and burgers don't have a foil thing so once you open it up you're out of luck trying to wrap it up to bring home because it's all loose. Overall though it's a great place and I'd definitely recommend." u'Stopped by for quick dinner after passing by dozens of times. Interior is clean and minimal and place was not too busy. I ordered the Kobeyaki burger of course since this is my first experience here. At $9ish price isn\'t bad at all and wait time was only about 5 min. Burger came nicely wrapped but not overly so like some places that make it cumbersome to eat. They have three sauce pumps so I took sample of wasabi mayo teriyaki kept up and good ole sriracha. The other one was spicy mayo.Upon a bite I really liked the quality of beef- it had that not from frozen texture that was also tender. I liked the medley of shredded carrots and cabbage. Not much teriyaki onion to find though. I mostly ate through without putting anymore sauce on because beef tasted good with the light amount already on the burger.I finished mine within 10 minutes at moderate pace... it was good but 20% short of reaching full satisfaction level for me a voracious eater 6\'3". Of course I\'m sure that\'s what the restaurant intended so that you\'d add side of fries. In fact if it weren\'t for time I would\'ve gotten some! Pretty good overall. I\'m coming back to try their ramen and soft shell crab bun next time!' u"Nice hidden spot by the park.Grilled chicken bow is pretty good $9.15Spicy tuna burger was good but missing something maybe it was a little dry or lacking in some ingredient I'm not sure but really tasted like it needed a little extra something. $8.95Sweet potato fries are amazing$3.25Green tea sandwich was really good not too sweet and stays perfect temp while you eat the rest of your food. $3.25Yuengling I don't remember what this was but I know it cost me $5.06 hahahaThis place is nice quite and clean would return for sure." u'This is a good midtown lunch spot for work I but don\'t think it should be considered a "must try" restaurant. It\'s basically an Asian fusion version of Chipotle (minus the e.coli outbreak issue of course).Employees are very nice and work quickly. The line is always very long during lunch hour but it goes by very fast! If 20 people are in front of you I\'d expect a 5-7 minute wait = not long at all. It\'s extremely close to BDFM or NQR 42nd Street trains and don\'t worry - this is one of the few areas in Times Square that is not taken over by slow walking tourists with their selfie stickies almost hitting you in the face. Good times..Grilled Chicken Bowl - \xa0you pick either: chicken shrimp beef or vegetables. Bowl bases include: brown rice salad udon noodles or white rice. \xa0It comes with: edamame yellow squash scallions and zucchini. (Note: you can request 2 bowl bases ie brown rice and salad) \xa0It\'s very good but it\'s too saucy for my taste. I wish they would add more edamame/veggies to make it a healthier meal (vs. the sauce which has a lot of sodium).Kobeyaki Burger - they add terikyaki ketchup and spicy mayo to their wagyu beef patty... great combo! It comes with cucumber lettuce scallions... VERY GOOD! The bun is amazing!Tuna Tataki Salad - Very good salad! Seared tuna edamame avocado lettuce cucumber scallions... creamy ginger dressing!']
24.Bareburger,[u"On our way to way to watch the Book of Mormom we were looking to grab a quick dinner.Let me start by saying that everyone at my table thought that the burgers were excellent. I ordered a create your own burger with duck. The meat was very moist and tasted exactly the way a duck burger should - although I probably do not have many points of comparison. The sauce options are also pretty good and I'm quite partial to their habanero mayo. We also ordered some sweet potato fries for the table and they were so good that they were rapidly gone. The only thing that I'd improve about this place is the speed. The food took over thirty minutes to arrive after we had ordered and that put us in a bit of a pickle because we had a play to catch. Other than that the service was excellent and the server did an especially good job of making recommendations." u'Best chicken burger on our trip to NYC!!!Open late- perfect for NYC Very helpful staff- and fun as wellOrdered the pickle fried chicken sandwich- OMG!!!! It was a juicy bite of heaven!!!! Finished it lip smacking fastSon ordered the quinoa bowl with chick peas and feta- that was very tasty as well.Husband ordered the CA Quinoa bowl- substantial and super delicious!Needless to say- we cleaned those plates and bowls.Loved the organic and local flare- and price was so reasonable for sustainably cooked food.Enjoy your flavorful meal!!!' u"Amazing choice of meats and additions. They have a sourcing menu in case you're interested where all the ingredients come from.My friend got the Grindhouse (made with Elk) and said it was great. I built my own burger with their beef patty and it was cooked to perfection. Wrapping it in collards was probably not the best choice because it's a little fiberous to get through but good. We shared sweet potato fries and crispy brussel sprouts and both were delicious.It was so nice to find an organic/GF place to eat in the city and our waitress was super nice and helpful. Definitely recommend them!" u"Visited: 02/24/2016We came and were immediately seated all the way in the back near the restrooms. Our server did her part and gave us everything we needed. My rating of this place is only a-ok because of the taste of the burger and the milkshake. I've mentioned this more than once I am sensitive to gamey food. First time ever I had a milkshake that was actually gamey. How is that possible? I have no idea! Thankfully my boyfriend was okay with the taste. I even tried an elk burger. I finished the entire burger and of course was very thankful the bun was great! Needless to say I was trying what I'd never eaten before. So can I say I tried it? Yes. Did I enjoy it. Not really. At least I've learned what I can and cannot eat yet again...nothing gamey :D" u'Fantastic selection of interesting burgers. Blue Elk Burger was delicious. Crispy Brussels Sprouts yummy!' u"Pretty good burgers excellent veggie options excellent service.Minor complaint.... Paid my extra $1.35 for Gouda on my burger and got the tiniest smear of melted cheese I've ever seen." u"My friend and I came here for dinner. I picked this place as a reward for running the New York City Half Marathon earlier in the morning. We arrived at 5:30 pm and there was a little wait to get a table. We waited at the bar where I got a Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro one of my all time favorites. A short while later they put us at the table by the entrance. I ordered their Fire Quacker burger and added a side baby green salad. I finished things off with a Sixpoint The Crisp Pilsner. I don't usually drink pilsners but they ran out of the beer that I had originally ordered. *Fire Quacker*It was made with duck pepper jack habanero mayo pickled jalape\xf1os red onions spinach tomatoes and a brioche bun. I loved the Fire Quacker! I don't think I've ever had a duck burger before but it was a good change from the usually beef burger. It had a nice spicy kick but it wasn't overwhelming. However it was a pretty small burger. I was kind of expecting something a little bit bigger.*Side Baby Green Salad*The salad was good and went well with my duck burger.Overall: I would definitely come here again. It's a place where you can try burgers not made with beef. You could even customize your burger from a list of ingredients if none of the burgers on the menu pique your interest." u"My very first one star review. I'm a fan of Bareburger and have been to several locations within the city and in NJ. I've always had a pleasant experience in all locations so hence I am a little confused and hugely disappointed by the terrible service we received from this location.It was close to 9 p.m. when I got to Port Autho Station from JFK airport. It's theater district so I \xa0knew most of the restaurants would be overpriced and touristy so I chose to come here. I thought it'd be safe. When we entered the restaurant we saw empty but not yet cleaned tables. The waitress told us to wait outside for 20 minutes. It would take them that long a time to clean up a table for 3.We should have just left for another place to eat but we waited and finally got our seats. I don't remember which of the three burgers we got but I remember we got our foods 50 mins after we ordered and everything including the onion rings and fries were cold. The fries and the buns were soggy and our glasses of water never got refilled. I have a suspicion that our waitress totally forgot about our order and didn't put them in until we asked about it about half an hour after we placed our order. Of course I haven't been back to this place since then and I don't plan on returning ever. There are lots of other Bareburger locations - I usually go to the locations in Chelsea or West Village in the city or Hoboken or Edgewater if I'm in NJ. (I'm also excited about the location preparing to be opened in Montclair NJ as well!) Maybe we just caught at a bad time when we were eating at this location but it was pretty terrible enough to say I would never be back." u"Location: located in Hell's Kitchen Bareburger was always on my mind when I was hungry. So when I finally got here I was excited to have some bizarre flavors of meats. And when I first stepped in I was quickly greeted by a lady to a sofa table. By looking through their menu I cannot stop watching all the calories on the menu. I was like no should i just leave?While I was struggling what to order I looked around some bears are on the wall the decoration is very rural stylized.Food: my friend ordered wikiwiki? and I DIY my own which consists of elk patty collard green as bun with special sauce and spicy pickle. The food is very disappointed i would say. The patty is very moistures and hard to bite. And the collard green bun is just.. a bad choices made by myself. I 'd rather have lettuce bun.Onion ring is dense tho and also spicy pickle somethings I still dislike it.Service: waited forever for food. I hate that.Overall: 2.5...." u"Bareburger is great! They've got so many options for delicious & messy burgers sandwiches sides and fried things. How have I never heard of this chain before? It seems like they're another one of those businesses that blossomed out of the last global financial crisis. Since then they've become wildly successful and gone global. Good for you Bareburger!We entered and were quickly seated upstairs in a small seating area. Our waiter seemed a little inexperienced but he was very nice and very informative. He started off by telling us about Bareburger's stance on using quality meat all organic ingredients etc. While I'm appreciative of the information I'm not a stickler for organic food. We ordered ...$8.80 Duck Duck Gouda - duck bacon gouda fried egg tomato fig jam:Very good fancy version of a bacon & egg sandwich. This would be a great breakfast sandwich. I couldn't really taste duck in the duck bacon. The brioche bun was toasted and nicely soaked up all the grease fat and egg yolk.$11.80 Supreme - beef colby country bacon green leaf onion rings chopped fries sauce:This is one heck of a burger. The patty was big and juicy. The cheese was nicely melted over the patty. You get a nice leaf of lettuce not that shredded crap. The most obvious thing about this burger - man you get a lot of onion rings. One inside the sandwich would have been enough for me. The two onion rings stacked on top of the bun looks interesting but you end up eating it separately anyway so it was kind of unnecessary stacking. Plus it squashes the bun the top. We also shared some onion rings and fries which ended up being too much food for us. The fried stuff was good but I thought the fried options are rather expensive.The food here is delicious. You can build or customize your own burger if you like. As for me if I wanted to do that I would have stayed home. They also have other interesting meat options like elk boar and bison. I'm interested in trying those next time. Heck I'll just order delivery since they have so many locations. Stuffing myself at home in my sweatpants sounds like a good option." u"I'll be ordering my burger medium-well from BareBurger from now on. Tonight medium-rare seemed rare for some off reason (delivered). No one's perfect. This is a quality restaurant and I love the taste of the gluten-free tapioca rice bun. Had a rich strawberry shake at the restaurant. It was great. It's possibly enough for 2 except for a strawberry milk lover like me then it's mine all mine. The atmosphere at this BareBurger is well-lit and I felt the server gave a good vibe. I've never been to any other BareBurger." u'On our last day in NYC I wanted to try another famous cheeseburger. After seeing this named one of "The Next Burger Superstar Chains" by an article I had to stop in. After all how could I call myself a burger connoisseur if I didn\'t? The restaurant is definitely trendy and unique. The artwork on the walls was fun and I felt like it would be a great place for a beer. We were in a little bit of a rush but there were only a few other tables so it wasn\'t a problem. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu.This is where the two stars come from. Was the food good? Yes. Was it great? No. I ordered the bison burger with a few standard toppings. We paid extra for a "special sauce" that I couldn\'t even taste or see so ended up using their special ketchup as well. I just wasn\'t impressed.Just to note: We visited this location on a Tuesday at lunch hour. Assuming they attract not only tourists but also business people on their lunch breaks we were caught a little off guard because both of their large screen tv\'s were playing Nickelodeon cartoons. And not old style cartoons like Looney Toons. We are talking Paw Patrol and Sofia the First (don\'t judge that I know the shows). We even asked if that was usual for them to be playing and were told that it was. Weird?' u"Wow very good El Matador burger! A group of us from my office went out for lunch here the staff were extremely helpful each of us pretty much ordered something different but the menu is full of gems we didn't manage to snatch one of each from it. I look forward to drop by a few times to try other things from the menu.My burger came with medium bison the bun was so soft the cheese went so well with the meat while it didn't overpower the taste. The only complaint I had was that the meat was not warm and everyone else said the same. I've had warmer if not hot & fresh off the pan meat at other burger places. It's still very good.ORDER THOSE SIDES!We had fried spicy pickles these were so buttery inside but spicy and crispy on the outside. The sweet fries were also seasoned those onion rings...omg so crispy and flavorful. I usually don't eat onion rings but I had two because the four dippings they came in paired very well. My coworker is health conscious she ordered a chicken salad she gave very good compliments too.Everything they serve here was organic it was not super greasy just moderate. The decor is pretty cool oh that lemonade is not sugar-sweet but it's got a fresh taste. Overall great burger place." u"So for the first time I tried a salad from bare burger and was pleasantly surprised. The Cali fresh was in fact refreshing because of the unusual flavors - cauliflower hummus watermelon radish and red quinoa. I also included grilled lemon chicken (greens promotion $13.95) and was happy to see 3 large pieces right on top of my salad.Downside - expensive for an untossed salad. Also I left a bunch of greens at the bottom of my box because I ran out of other components. So overall I probably wouldn't crave it or order it again. Other things we ordered - Panko crusted zucchini (yum) fried pickes (good texture but didn't love the flavor) and fries (can't really go wrong)." u"Stopped in here because my husband has been raving about the Hudson salad and it didn't disappoint. The small is an enormous protein size and comes with duck bacon yes duck bacon. Amazing. Fried egg on top and mixed with the buttermilk dressing the whole thing was super creamy. Whole half of an avocado and I added chicken for an incredibly satisfying (albeit a bit expensive even if it's all organic) salad. $16 with added protein. Service was prompt friendly and efficient. Loved the location." u'Been hearing a good amount lately about Bare. \xa0My expectations were high and they delivered. \xa0Strong options for meat and non meat eaters along with solid prepared burgers so you do not get overwhelmed by every option. Service was fine. \xa0Prices are NY. \xa0Will be back to try other options and will update.' u"I really enjoyed bareburger! They had a couple of vegan options (clearly marked) which is so rare in a burger place. I absolutely loved my vegan burger. I tried the sweet potato wild rice burger with the sprouted wheat bun- very hearty and I think the bun is so important to the burger! They had lots of veggie toppings to choose from.Really good service and reasonable price. Waitress was very attentive. Good vibe to the place too.I will be back to try the other veggie burger patties-- farmer's quinoa and black bean! They also have salads fries. Will be back for a good veggie burger fix!" u"(This is probably closer to 4.5 stars to me.) \xa0Bareburger has wonderful food although the visible focus is on its organic focus and adding interesting focus on including relatively unusual meats for a burger place -- along with the standards there's also elk bison wild boar and duck. \xa0[Bareburger ostrich might make a great addition to your lineup!] \xa0The burgers are excellent and there are several salads for those so inclined. \xa0I thought the fries were just okay but the sauces with them were incredible. \xa0The iced teas (although unsweetened) are flavorful as are the lemonades. \xa0The hot (spicy) honey milkshake was outstanding! \xa0There are a few beers wines and cocktails as well.The restaurant has kind of a quirky modern industrial look to its narrow two-story space. \xa0The staff was warm friendly and patient.I would definitely eat here again!" u'This location is not as good as the others. The other locations are very consistent and similar in terms of food service etc. -- the service stinks here the food has no flavor and you have a longer wait. Two stars for the pickles and convenient location minus 3 stars for excessive waits with no help from the two hostesses the terrible wait staff with weird rules (you have to pur in an order for a side of mayo and then wait for a food runner to bring it out? The restaurant is empty and you are doing nothing. I am watching you from five feet away. Gimme the friggin mayo.)Blah.' u"Swung by here after seeing that they had grass fed burgers and such. We weren't disappointed.Food was good and their signature milkshake with hot sauce was unique and worth trying."]
157.Pongsri Thai Restaurant,[u'The service was friendly and efficient. Food was good. We had the spicy curry shrimp and the red snapper. Both tasted as they should. Prices were reasonable and the location was perfect! I would definitely eat here again.' u'Do not tip them until you absolutely leave. If we knew they would gossip about us hanging out there after we paid them we would not have tipped any.Note: it is not like they were so busy that they needed the space--most people know enough about the health and safety violations of this place (including mice) that the reputation here never again made this place busy enough.' u"This place was pretty good Thai but we've definitely had better. The service was very efficient and quite friendly. A bit slow at times but they were pretty busy.We had two small kids with us and they were very sweet and welcoming to them.We had the Panang curry but it was all coconut cream (couldn't taste curry). This may have been because we asked for mild (for our kids). We also had the Pad Kra Prow which was awesome. Chicken satay spring rolls Tom yum soup were all good. Mango and sticky rice dessert was nice.Menu is HUGE prices really reasonable. Worth a try." u'If this place wasn\'t in the heart of the theater district it might only get 4 stars but:- the menu is HUGE- the dishes are priced completely reasonably (no markup for location)- they take reservations and managed to get me a reservation for 4 people at 6pm on a busy Saturday nightIt\'s not a glamorous spot but all 4 of us absolutely loved our dishes/the experience as a whole. Everyone found plenty of things that interested them (the menu is seriously comprehensive) and the food and service was extremely quick and pleasant.I ordered the Tao-Hoo Pad Ped-Nor-Mai a vegetarian dish with fried tofu chili paste and veggies. It was packed with great flavor the vegetables tasted incredibly fresh and the portion was large but not overwhelming. Others at the table got: Pad Thai vegetables in peanut sauce and Pineapple Fried Rice. I think everyone cleared their plate completely!I was really blown away by how quickly our food came out how friendly the entire staff was and by how "normal" (non-midtown NYC) everything was. It felt like a real hidden gem among countless tourist traps/over-priced & underwhelming pre-theater dinner menus.' u"Me and a group of friends came across this place while doing touristy things in Times Square. They seated us quickly and were very attentive while we were there. The pad see ew was pretty good as was the papaya salad. However they forgot a couple things that we had ordered. Thankfully the portions were big enough that we didn't really need those extra dishes.Plus the mango sticky rice dessert was delicious!" u'By far the best Thai restaurant. Most or all dishes are very well made. They are a bit Americanized but catered very well. The best quality to this restaurant is the consistency. Never had a bad experience thus far:)' u'One of my favorite thai places in the city. The green and panang curry are wonderful. The pad thai is pretty tasty as well. Decor is warm and welcoming. Customer service could be better.' u"This was some of the best Vietnamese food I've ever had. Everything was fresh and very affordable. I had the summer rolls with all the delicious hot sauces and pho. I highly reccomend going Herr. I've lived in this neighborhood for almost 5 years now and tonigh was my first night coming here. I will be sure to come more often!!" u"I've eaten here for lunch and dinner. with colleagues and family. they are all super nice and friendly. \xa0the food is add authentic as it can get. we've never had to wait as this place is pretty spacious. portion size does fall a little small for the prices they charge but since they are in the tourist area of the Broadway shows it's on par with other restaurants. they also have two sister locations one in Chinatown and the other in Chelsea. they are great as well." u"Pros: large tables and normal chairs (all the thai places nowadays are SO crowded) authentic food good location for pre-theatreCons: A little pricey for Thai food serving sizes are okay but seem a little light not really an inspiring place where I feel I can relax.Overall it's a place I've been a few times but it could be better." u'Consistent good food had the chicken noodle soup. Reasonable price for lunch special in theater district/midtown ($8 with chicken) - $10 credit card minimum!!!Would go again!' u'Off the main 8th Avenue is this hidden spot. You walk in and the place is roomy. Quickly you are seated. It was 10pm and they gladly preswnted the menue. Late dinners after a broadway show is perfect way to dine and chat without posting a review :)We orderrd the Thai version of wonton soup and it was perfect. Freshly made wontons garnished with chives. The broth tasty. The night wss a summer night but after being indoors in aur conditioning this little cup was magical. We both ordered Pad See-Ew. Deliciously fresh. One selected pork and the other shrimp. Veggies delight and noodles smooth and yummy. Glad we ran inyo this place. But that is the magic of New York city :) every street has its magic.' u'Amazing food. I had the ginger duck and my wife had the pad Thai. We read elsewhere of extensive gluten free options but we did not find this to be the case. We were only given the option of pad Thai. Service was fast but hurried. We were not offered drinks initially. We had to specifically request later and follow up to actually receive them. Then we received one wrong wine and had request a fix.' u'Superb Thai Food in the heart of the Theater DistrictCame to grab a bite of good Thai before the show. We were told there may be a 30 min wait - but we were seated right away. The dining room is small but the very clean. I ordered the # 107: coconut milk based yellow curry with sweet potatoes onion and red and green peppers - with your choice of protein. XLNT.' u"First off I'm already skeptical since this is a midtown Asian food spot that's not in Hell's Kitchen. The menu was like 7 pages so doesnt look very specialized. Lo & behold the ba-mee praram was soaked in so much peanut sauce it might as well be a thick soup. I've never swallowed so much peanut sauce in my life even in a dare. My wife ordered a padthai and it was dry af. To top it off mandatory tip. Def not coming back." u"Amazing food! I had the Pad Thai with beef and it might be one of the best things I've eaten in NYC thus far. Great service as well! Our cups were never dry and the staff was very friendly! There was no wait we got right in and they had our meal served very fast!" u"There's a lot of options for Thai food nowadays.This one was just for convenience in location if you are around Times Square area otherwise you should go to Hell's Kitchen for better Thai Food.Lunch special available. \xa0for $ 13.00 you get a nice Rice or noodle dishes.I ordered the Beef Pad See Eww - Simple 3 \xa0main topic (Beef Chinese Broccoli and Thick flat Noodles). \xa0Apparently there was 40% meat 40% Chinese Broccoli and 20% noodles. It wasn't full for me. \xa02nd floor is quiet 1st floor during Lunch hours is a mad house. \xa0Just FYI." u'My husband and I have been here twice. I did not hesitate to take a friend from NJ who is not very familiar with Thai food. The menu is extensive and the courteous wait staff is happy to help recommend something to your liking. With a few hints from you it is almost a guarantee that a heavenly plate will land before you which leaves you sated. It was obvious to all of us that there is a reason the family has been very successful in the Thai restaurant business for 44 years! Very clean kind wait staff excellent meals. Without a doubt this is a business which is worthy of repeat visits.' u'Ate dinner here with reservation with family. This was in theater district after the show. Food was authentic Thai. Excellent service with water refill. Looks clean. Order several entrees and shared family style.' u"It was really a great gem in time square. I wasn't expecting much but the tom yum was awesome. Then I had a summer roll with the most delicious peanut sauce. I had green curry for dinner. I am a green curry expert - eating it that is. This one was excellent. Then to top off an amazing dinner I had mango and rice. It was so good - cozy and exactly how I wanted to end my meal. \xa0I am so happy to have found a good place here as I come for work in NYC often and I have a hard time finding a good spot for a reasonable price that doesn't feel like a trap for tourist. This was nice. I will bring my boyfriend back next time he is in town."]
106.Don Antonio By Starita,[u"Don Antonio's is fantastic as its essentially another branch of Keste which is one of my favorite pizza places in the city -- the menus are very similar and Don Antonio has the absolutely incredible pizza del re.In the spirit of doing something different though I got the Montanara as that is the specialty here. I liked it but wasn't blown away -- I just don't think I'm that crazy about fried pizza in general. Like everything else here the ingredients were fantastic and I still really enjoyed it but I didn't find it to be anywhere near as good as the typical Keste / Don Antonio classics." u"I came here a few months ago and forgot to leave a review. Now back in the city eating some decent pizza at Nino's 46 I remember how truly awful it was.The restaurant was busy and had a good lively atmosphere so I sat at the bar and ordered the ricotta e noci. None of the ingredients appeared to be on the pizza and it was completely bland. I had to ask if this was what I actually ordered. I never send food back but I sent this back. In its place I ordered the pistaccio e salsiccia. Slightly more flavor but overall a greasy heavy mess. I was hungry so I attempted to eat part of it but this may have been one of the worst meals I have had in NYC. At least the waitress was nice but otherwise....stay away." u'What can I say that hasnt been said before. Great tasting pizza - close to the Theaters or Time Square. You can watch your pizza being made. Had the butcher and the signature pizza - both were amazing experiences. Fresh ingredients Italian staff and bustling place. Must stop for future visits to NY.' u"Absolute pizza heaven.For a gluten free gal like me this place is a pizza MECCA. After our broadway show google maps indicated we were only steps away from this highly rated place. We made the best decision to come here.We split the following between my family of 4:1) Toscona salad: Mixed greens light lemon vinaigrette and slices of pears. \xa0Refreshing but not a lot of salad.2) Angioletti salad (gluten free): Doughy pillows of heaven delicious marinated tomato salad and argula--I could eat this every day. SO tasty and not your usual salad.3) Gluten free pope's pizza: butternut squash as the sauce mozzarella and yummy zucchini/squash on top. \xa0A little bit on the salty side but I was extremely impressed with this gluten free pizza--love that it doesn't taste like a frozen crust and the pizza was quite large!4) The Butcher -- salami sausage and all around yumminess. I didn't have any as I am gluten free but my family enjoyed this pizza.5) Antonio Starita's specialty--lightly fried pizza with mozzarella tomato sauce and basil. \xa0Super simply quite small but by far my mom's favorite! Cannot recommend this place enough. \xa0Service was attentive ambiance was lovely and the food was incredible. \xa0Great way to end our evening!" u"Delicious Neapolitan style pizza. Something about the water and the weather in nyc that makes bread and pizza dough amazing. San Diego has pizza like this but the crust isn't as flavorful light or tasty.I recommend their pizza and will try it again on my next visit.- Yes you can order to go." u"We ate hear twice during our three-night stay in NYC. \xa0I am gluten-free and read Yelp reviews to find the best GF pizza in NYC. \xa0I found it!I highly recommend the Pope's Pizza. \xa0I though after having several thousand pizzas in my lifetime I tried it all. \xa0Then I had the Pizza del Papa aka Pope's Pizza. \xa0Instead of a red sauce base it has butternut squash base - and then they put smoked buffalo mozz and a bunch of veggies. \xa0Truly unique flavors.I also highly recommend the appetizer salad with the gluten-free fried dough in it. It is called the Angioletti. \xa0The little strips of fried dough tasted like doughy elephant ears I used to eat at festivals in the Midwest growing up. I loved it!I am neutral on the gluten-free Margherita pizza. \xa0I thought the flavors were just okay - the red marinara sauce is just okay nothing special. \xa0Also there was one piece of basil on the entire pizza. \xa0If I am having a Margherita I want basil flavor in each bite. \xa0Next time I am in NYC I'm going for the Pope's Pizza and the Angioletti salad again." u"The pizza was amazing. Signature pizza is lightly fried and unbelievable. The place is crazy busy and the waitstaff treats you like a number but it's worth getting a ticket!!!!!We had sausage and margherita pizza. The pizza is too much for one but not enough for two lol so we went with the two and glad we did!!" u'The pizza here was actually pretty great!! We had the margarita pizza some type of sausage pistachio pizza and a fried onion mushroom pizza. \xa0The margarita pizza was my favorite and we actually ordered another one afterwards because it was so good!! :) The service was great! There is a bathroom to use (which is a plus in NYC!!!) Lol I would def go back here and eat again! My least fav pizza was the fried onion and mushroom as I though the waitress said "onion and meat" and I just wasn\'t wanting a basically only onion pizza! Lol Otherwise everyone loved everything and we would go back again! :)' u'I hate to leave these guys a less-than-stellar review because their pizzas are seriously delicious. We have friends who live in the neighborhood and this is our go-to place for takeout whenever we get together at their place. I\'ll start with the good:Their pistachio salchicha pizza is one of the best things I\'ve ever tasted. It\'s so good that I think about it for days after and have been known to break a diet to devour three (or more) slices. It\'s worth ordering even if you\'re not typically an adventurous eater. In fact all of their pizzas are good in my opinion but this one is the real stand-out. The bad:Ordering from there is almost always a huge pain in the ass. Every time we call there is a language barrier and chaos that makes it very hard to communicate with their staff. The last time my significant other called to place an order it took him nearly ten minutes to order three pizzas and a Caprese salad. He speaks very clearly and is an effective communicator so I know it wasn\'t something on his side.Their version of a Caprese salad is completely bastardized. First the woman on the other end didn\'t know what a "Caprese salad" was even though it\'s ON THEIR MENU. She had to ask like three people and we had to tell her the ingredients. It was mind-boggling considering that this is an Italian restaurant and this is a very simple and traditional dish. Secondly what I received (pictured) was not a proper Caprese salad. Both my SO and I are of Italian extraction and we were dumbfounded by how they thought that a few cherry tomatoes some pitiful hard balls of mozzarella and a couple of wilted basil leaves are the proper presentation. Beats me! TLDR: The pizza is good but any Italian restaurant worth its salt should know how to make a Caprese salad.' u"Love the chewy crust but Keste is more chewy. I had the vegan pie and I think it would have tasted better not vegan. The veggies weren't bland and it made the pizza soggy. I have intentions of coming back and ordering a different pie since I am not longer vegan. My sibs pie looked better and she loved it. All that cheese yum!" u"I dragged my brother here after work one day. I was looking for good pizza and Hell's Kitchen and saw this restaurant on every single list - rightfully so! I knew we had chosen the right place when we saw all the other customers were Italian. The pizza here was exactly what we were looking for delicious crust & buffalo mozzarella cheese. We each got our own pie which was plenty of food and couldn't resist some dessert and cappuccino's.My brother had the margherita with prosciutto: imported buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto di parma. The prosciutto was deliciously thin & fresh. I ordered the Antonio Starita's specialty: lightly fried pizza dough topped with signature Starita tomato sauce imported smoked buffalo mozzarella and basil finished in our wood-fired oven. One of the best wood-fired pizza's i've ever had." u"Wait staff and seating quick and attentive. The pizza order was off the lunch menu so it was 8 inch size pies ordered. Husband didn't really like the fried pizza crust was a little too bready. I had the margarita pizza with prosciutto which was yummy. Probably like the little bit of seasoning in the crust and in the sauce aside from that pretty good pizza in Manhattan. Next time I would probably order from the main menu and customize the pizza going to a larger pie hence you'll get a thinner crust." u"greatest pizza I have ever had. Also they ship their IPA straight from Italy. A buddy of mine from Queens recommended this place. You'll easily pay $45 for a small-6 slice pizza and a few beers but oh boy is it worth it. The water really makes the difference when it comes to the dough they use. This place is awesome and is a must stop if you are ever in Manhattan. Do yourself a favor and order the Salsiccia e Friarielli - smoked buffalo mozzarella Italian rapini sausage extra virgin olive oil. If that doesn't persuade you I am not sure what will :)" u"I love pizza. \xa0It's the food I would choose if I was stuck on a desert island with only one thing to eat. \xa0 And with Taylor Swift as my witness I could exist on the Montanara Starita pizza alone for the rest of my days. \xa0 Something about that pizza just makes me want to sing. \xa0I don't know why it is so delicious it just is.The salads are excellent here as well and I usually split a salad with whomever I am meeting for dinner. \xa0The service is great...they know how to get you in and out because there's usually a line for tables but they are able to ensure you enjoy your meal without feeling rushed.If I ever hit the Powerball I'm going to have a king size bed made out of Montanara Starita pizzas and I won't leave it until I've eaten the whole thing leaving me lying on the floor bloated and covered in sauce but ultimately content." u"My friend and I came here late on a Friday night. I can't say much about the service since we just sat at the bar for dinner though the bartender helping us was quite nice. The interior of the restaurant seemed spacious though it was a bit loud. For dinner we split the Pizza Fritta and the Capriciosa pizza. The pizza fritta was amazing consisting of very lightly fried pizza dough filled with cheese tomatoes and salami. It was extremely cheesy and as a result extremely filling. The cheese was gooey and melt-in-your-mouth delicious; the tomatoes were fresh and cooked perfectly; and the salami was also quite flavorful. The Capriciosa pizza was also good but not as good as the pizza fritta. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious and it was very well seasoned though I wish there had been a bit more basil. It was much lighter than expected with fluffy but thin and charred crust. It should also be noted that the pizzas here are only bit larger than personal-sized and while delicious perhaps a bit pricey for the size. However overall the food was quite good." u"On our last trip to NY I selected this restaurant because my boyfriend is gluten and yeast sensitive. I knew it was a crap shoot concerning the yeast but sometimes he's able to consume GF bread or pizza if he hasn't had any products with yeast in a a while. This means he doesn't eat GF bread salad dressings or any vinegar products on a regular basis. He used to love eating pizza before he was diagnosed so I thought this would be a nice treat. I had heard of Keste years back but thought that Don Antonio's might be less crowded. They're run by the same folks who own Keste. We went during an off-time and were able to be seated straightaway. It's smaller than I had thought. They have a lunch special which is a smaller pie with the option to add on salad for $5. I'm the type of gal who likes really simple things on her pizza. I'm happy with a Margherita or anything along those lines. My boyfriend prefers meat with a side of meat on his. Our server said each pizza is individual-sized so he orders a GF pizza with sausage pepperoni and some other meats on it. I ordered a regular Keste. Both were great but the GF pizza was $24 and double the size of my $10 one. We could have easily shared the GF one. The GF pizza was kind of flat which a good sign they didn't use a lot of yeast. He didn't experience any adverse effects afterwards which was great!Overall a very positive dining experience. The only downsides was the misinformation regarding the portion size and they played Top 40 hits at a high volume on a weekday afternoon. It's not a place where one would go to have a conversation." u"Very good pizza good atmosphere although a bit loud  probably because it's a small place. Bartender is nice and attentive. So many selections so little time! Another place added on my list of pizza go to place in NYC." u'We didn\'t have quite enough time to stick around during our lunch hour so we placed an order to go. Staff was friendly enough. Pizza is severely overpriced. The area in the front is too small to wait around in especially since the bar takes up a good chunk of space.We got the margherita and the prosciutto pizzas. The margherita was good but not worth the price it costs. The prosciutto was fine except the crust was burnt. Both pizzas were not sliced even though they knew we were taking them to go and they were given to us in boxes. Oh well. Not a terrible place if you want an "authentic" pizza experience but a cheap slice you can fold and eat would have sufficed.' u"The pizza here comes out SO FAST it's unbelievable. You can even see them making your pizza on the tv screen. We ordered the Margherita and Margherita with sausage (each about $15-$20). They were good but nothing too special in my opinion. The pizzas look big but they're sliced up into 4 pieces and it's very doable to finish a whole pizza by yourself." u"Owned by the same people as Keste. Delicious and tastes the exact same as Keste. I've had the butternut squash pizza Margherita Margherita truffle mushroom and prosuitto one and some others.They are all delicious! The crust is very light and soft. Sometimes too a fault! Over all they have great service and their delivery is incredibly fast. The pizza holds up pretty well too! Just reheat it in the oven."]
187.St. Andrews,[u"After a lot of walking perusing the nearby restaurants (and finding they were above our price range) my friend and I decided on this place. We were immediately seated while the server checked in on us repeatedly to make we had everything we needed. She was very courteous without being pushy. Service alone would be 5 stars; however the food wasn't anything remarkable. I had the fish and chips while my friend had the Shepard's pie. My fish had no flavor (aside from the tartar sauce I had to repeatedly dunk it in) and I could've used more than two fillets. My friend didn't finish her pie though she said it was good. We split an ice cream dessert which was as good as ice creams go. Overall our bill came to $54 sans tip. Not a shabby meal but we probably won't be going there anytime soon." u"I stumbled on this place while walking around Times Square and on a whim decided to have dinner there. The bar and second floor restaurant were almost empty so seating was not a problem (I didn't have a reservation and it was a Saturday). I was hungry so I ordered the rib eye. It took 45 minutes for my food to arrive. When it finally did arrive it was luke warm and was one of the toughest and rubbery pieces of meat that I have ever had. Cutting it was like sawing through a tire. I left over half of it on the plate. Such a waste of money.I thought that maybe if I had ordered something other than a rib eye the food would have been better. But the couple next to me had ordered the salmon and chicken and they were complaining to the waitress about their food as I was leaving.The reason I gave it 2 stars was due to the scotch. Nice selection. If I ever went back it would be for drinks not food." u"Your standard midtown pub. It's quite dark inside with dim ceiling lights. I went at 5:30 pm on a Thursday - well in the middle of happy hour - but three draught beers were $25. Not ideal for a post-work alcohol satisfaction you're trying to get. I did like the bartenders wearing kilts and the Scottish plaid wallpapers. The bartenders were also attentive and provided quick service." u'RUDE SERVICE! DO NOT RECCOMMENDWe were looking for a place for our group to eat before a broadway show and the hostess was extremely rude. I asked if it was possible to eat on the ground floor because the restaurant is extremely dark and her response was "we\'re going to put you where we are going to put you. You didn\'t have a reservation so this is where we are going to put you." I honeslty have been to hundreds of restaurants and her rude service was so appalling I walked out and will never return here.' u"Great place for a pre theater meal. Portions are hardy but not too much. That's a good thing. You want to save room for desert. So far I've had the Classic Turkey Club. Very good. My daughter has had the fish and chips one time we went and a hamburger another. She was pleased with both. Desert is the killer! Soooo good! My daughter has Sticky Toffee Pudding. I get the Butterscotch Ice cream Sandwiches. Definitely no complaints! Service is very reliable. We were neither bothered or ignored. The atmosphere takes me away. I love the feeling of being at St. Andrews. Golf anyone?If you need a nice pre theater restaurant I suggest trying St. Andrews. I'm never disappointed." u"Stopped in this little gem while waiting to meet with my group for dinner. \xa0I sat alone at the bar and had a few drinks. \xa0The bartenders were fabulous. \xa0They kept me company and initiated conversation with me while also taking care to pay attention to everyone else at the bar. \xa0The experience was so nice that despite the number of bars in NYC I'd definitely come here again!" u'Great Scottish ale. \xa0Decent whisky. Used to love this place. \xa0Service is slow and inconsistent. \xa0 Scottish (?) waitress seems disturbed that she has customers. \xa0All the tables around me agree. Good food. Sit at the bar not a bar table.' u"Some friends and I ended up at St. Andrew's after seeing a friend perform in a small play in the neighborhood. At 9 p.m. on a Saturday night the upstairs was pretty empty and to our advantage. Seven of us were very easily seated!Noting itself as the only Scottish restaurant in Manhattan the waiters donned kilts and haggis was most certainly on the menu. We looked at the pub menu and there were some cheaper choices on that menu but burgers were still $17 dollars. All I wanted was a burger so...I paid the $17. Ouch. Well at least it WAS a good burger. The fries were passable. Most of my friends ended up getting wings and / or saut\xe9ed vegetables. (The manager was very quick to cater one of my vegan friends and tell her what was animal-free. Wonderful of him to to!) As we left later in the evening live music was playing downstairs but I was glad to be upstairs where we were able to converse over good food. This is a nice little respite in the cacophony of the Times Square area!" u'I used to love this place but now their service is... - or shall I say they have ridiculous procedures to follow? So I was standing by the bar (near the computer) for a while waiting for one of the two bartenders to notice my existence. 5 mins later a very sweet waitress came. She kindly placed my order and put the receipt on the counter. A bartender finally noticed that I was visible and got the drink I ordered.And then when I was trying to grab my drink the bartender suddenly got triggered and YELLED AT ME (literally): "THIS IS NOT YOUR DRINK!!!"Dude chill...seriously this is just a ginger beer. And this IS my drink...can you stop acting like I\'m a wanker trying to steal your girl or something??Anyway so I got yelled and more people noticed my existence as a "beer thief". While I was not allowed to grab my drink all I could do was to stare at it sitting 10 inches from me (great)Around ten minutes later the sweet waitress came - grabbed the beer - turned around - gave it to me. Yeah! But wait...she looked a bit annoyed innit? Maybe she\'s complaining: why don\'t you grab your own beer?? You have to let me do it???Well dear I wish I could...but that bartender looked like he\'s going to throw a uncooked haggis in my face if I do that..so...nopeAnd that\'s my review' u"My friends took me here as a birthday surprise. It was amazing and just like we were back in Scotland. The whiskey tasting was delicious the men wear kilts the seats are plaid and the food tastes just like it does in Scotland. I wouldn't eat haggis or scotch eggs anywhere else but here in the states. Definitely coming back. The food was beyond incredible." u"I've been coming to St. Andrews for a decade and has always welcomed me warmly. When they moved to a new location a few years ago on 46th street I was concerned their quality of service would not come with it. Luckily this was not the case. With the price of single malts being what they are it's difficult to keep the cost low but they manage it better than some of their whisky competitors in town. Huge disappointment though they eliminated their turkey burger from the menu." u"Have come here a few times a year not as much since they moved. Last time about two months ago. Sat at the bar with some friends as usual ordered drinks and dinner after a lecture nearby. No Scottish barkeeps as there always were. Disorganized everything slow took forever food came no silverware took a good ten minutes to get it--bartender talking to people not watching the bar--amateur hour. Used to love this place. Took 2 hours to get everything. Management--monitor your place and do something soon or you will be history in the pantheon of failed New York public houses. \xa0Addendum. After I wrote this they told me the menu prices were wrong. My 13.75 dram is actually $40. To their credit they did not charge me but c'mon!!!! \xa0Everyone \xa0agreed. Last draw. Last dram! Keen's when you need some scotch-a professional establishment. Sad. Bye!!" u"Let's just start with the fact that I've been coming here for about 7 years. Beginning with their original location a few streets down on 44th street. The current location is a huge step since the bar area is bigger they have an upstairs seating area and the restaurant overall is just gorgeous. If you are looking for a fantastic beer and scotch collection this is it. Today I had a few delirium and the buffalo calamari -- which I have mentioned is amazing in a previous review. Today of course it didn't disappoint! The staff overall are very friendly and attentive. For locals it is a hangout. For tourists if are lucky enough to find this spot you have arrived." u"I have stumbled upon this place next to Times Square twice now. Once with my father on a college tour of the northeast and another when my fiance and I were exploring the city looking for a drink. The food here is okay but it is reasonably priced especially for the location it is in. I have stopped at the TGI Friday's nearby and the upcharge for that particular restaurant is absurd just because of its location next to Times Square. However back to St. Andrews. I enjoy this restaurant it has a cool pub vibe. It has an assortment of alcohol. However they do not have Irish Car Bombs which I was disappointed in however it is a Scottish pub in their defense. We had the fish and chips and they were very good. We also had a few vodka tonics and jack and cokes they were strong and good." u"I was lured here by the promise of good Scottish fare and waiters in Kilts. I was not disappointed. The bar was crazy crowded on a Friday evening so we opted for a table. They took us upstairs which is great if you want to hear each other's conversations. The drinks were awesome--good Dark N' Stormy and if you want a good Cider you need to try the Koppaberg Pear Cider. Big bottle of sweet refreshing cider to wash down your meal with!! The dinner menu was a little extreme for us so we asked if we could see the pub fare menu--to which they kindly obliged. Awesome! You need to order the Chicken Pot Pie--thick creamy and homemade goodness. I'll definitely be returning for this. If not for the pot pie then for the fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs--intense flavor and moist. These two items are enough of a reason to return that is if the waiters in kilts isn't enough of a reason already. Easily 4 stars a 5th if they had any drink specials which I wish they could have extended to us. Regardless I will be returning for some mo' pot pie." u'Without Yelp we would not have found St. Andrews in the jam-packed streets of the Theatre District. \xa0Quite a find it is too and it has quickly become one of our regular haunts on our trips to the City. The bar itself is luxuriously long and inviting. \xa0With be-kilted bartenders and warm lighting \xa0this is a great (even romantic) place for a pre- or post-show cocktail. \xa0Most recently we stopped in for dinner. \xa0Mr. M rated the shepherd\'s pie a "5" and I rated my grilled chicken sandwich a "2." Most regrettably the chicken was over-cooked and the focaccia was stale. \xa0Happily the super delicious hand cut fries and artisanal pickles compensated for the sandwich\'s deficits.Notwithstanding these imperfections we will return because we like St. Andrew\'s vibe convenient location general absence of tourists and the kilts :-).' u"St. Andrews was a great experience. Coming here during the Christmas season the food was yummy \xa0there was plenty of space and there was great ambience. They had a lot of Christmas songs playing overall a fun place to eat.New England Clam Chowder followed by grilled salmon with potatoes and asparagus - everything was great.Fun fact: The waiters are all wearing kilts which adds to the Scottish feel and they were super attentive/friendly. I'd definitely revisit before or after a Broadway show!" u"Good selection of beer and whiskey in a typical Irish pub-in-Times Square setting. Food is run-of-the-mill dive drivel. Good for drinks after work unless you're a tourist in which case enjoy I guess?" u'Very nice bar within a shortWalk from Palace Theater and Times Square. Specializes in Scotches. \xa0Decor is a hybrid of bar and bistro. \xa0Service staff seems stretched thin so you may have to wait a little while for service. \xa0TheService staff is attentive but busy. \xa0Bar seems organized and diligent so my guess is they could use a couple more staff. \xa0The plus is that you are not rushed and can gather your group as they trickleIn and enjoy a few drinks without some banshee pestering you for more orders. \xa0St. Andrews came highly recommended by a friend who comes here frequently. \xa0This place is a refuge fromThe manic Times Square scene.' u'there\'s a Prix Fixe menu for $35.. and if you get the steak option it\'s $8 more "due to an increasing meat costs" \xa0they make sure to write it in small faded font with no proper footnote reference \xa0bravo! Besides that whole thing the food was just okay nothing special. You wanna come here to drink or maybe try the awful smelly haggis (because it\'s prepared well just not my cup of tea). You\'ll find this to be of those Times Square tourist traps in some ways. Not the worst but nothing formidable.']
138.Torishin,[u"Great restaurant amazing service. Not for a picky eater as the Omakase is a great delicious value as long as you are open minded to parts of the chicken that aren't eaten in a traditional american household. We had the 10 skewer omakase which featured the fillet ribs oyster heart. We added in the duck and had to taste the crispy pork belly. As much as I want to ding them for serving small beers the service was so good that there was never a moment that the waitress didn't have the next one ready right away.Protip - sit at the counter preferably with a view of the grill." u'Not a pleasant experience..We went for dinner today. We were welcomed warmly by a receptionist who had a nice smile. We were really excited to try michelin one star yakidoris!1) As soon as we were seated our waitress Mihee told us that kitchen is little backed up so it might take 10-15 mins to get orders which was totally fine with us. We waited waited and did not even complain about getting our food late since the restaurant was packed. We tried to understand.. But we were seated at 7:20 ended up getting our food on the table at 8:15. So it took almost an hour which was ridiculous for little skewers. 2) We also ordered wagyu and it was the worst wagyu I have ever had. It was very dry. I was surprised that they charged \xa0$20+ for small 5 pieces with that quality (I understand that Wagyu is expensive in general but with that quality I could do a better job). Who doesn\'t love Wagyu? but that was the worst one ever. Even Ootoya has better wagyu skewers for $7 and almost the same amount. Trust me. 3) HERE IS THE WORST PART. We ordered crispy chicken skin skewers but we ended up getting "neck" skin skewers. our waitress had a bad service. No apologies were given which was unexpected at michelin one star restaurant. She told us that they did not have the regular skin skewers except the last pieces of neck skin. okay fine. We took it "without any complains." This is when the horrible service all started. We found obviously visible feathers on the skin so we sent them back and told her that we can not eat them since there were obvious feathers on the skin. We lost our appetite already. still no apologies. she said she will mention it to the chef. she brought them back to us again maybe a couple mins after and that\'s when I thought Torishin is the worst restaurant for michelin one star. The skewers that she brought back were burnt.. as you can see in the picture. (but picture looks less burnt..) and very dry but no feathers. I wasn\'t sure if I was supposed to be happy about it. She emphasized that those were the last neck skin they have for the night and she refused to take them down from our orders. AND SHE FORCED US TO TRY THEM. NASTY. I was really surprised that she even brought them back AND told us that it is actually okay to eat feathers. OH REALLY? then why don\'t you try them. I have a master\'s degree in Nutrition and I have never.. NEVER heard about eating feathers. She never apologized to us and left our table. We refused to eat them "obviously." I still can not believe they have been getting michelin one star in the past 4-5years straight. The money is not the problem here but her reaction + service totally got me.4) We asked our waitress for water and she brought the water when we asked again 20mins after. 5) One of chefs was talking on the phone while cooking.. He put his phone on his shoulder and cook. No mask. As you can see the counter skewer manchines are at about your chest level or maybe little below. You can have skewers with his saliva on. Great.6) I am really generous about giving tips but I gave her little more than 10% of tips which I thought was too much for her and food.7) The only reason why they got 1 star is the restroom (obviously you can\'t give the restaurants 0 star from Yelp but still..) high tech toilet seats and clean restroom. It is really frustrating to have an experience like this at michelin star restaurant. Totally ruined our appetite. I am 100% sure I won\'t be back to this restaurant and hope you are able to eat the feathers on the skin when you go here.' u"Coming from Los Angeles I had made reservation a couple of months in advance as it was a Michelin star restaurant. \xa0They requested a credit card to confirm which I gave them. \xa0We were excited as this was our first Michelin star restaurant and my first trip to NYC. \xa0We met my sister and husband who flew in from Florida and went together. \xa0The first outpoint was that we were given a waitress from Thailand who did not speak or understand English very well. \xa0She asked us if we had been there before and we told her no. \xa0We expected that she would explain the menu to us and how it works (it's not sushi which we knew going in). \xa0As she couldn't speak English or maybe had no idea herself this did not happen. \xa0She suggested we take the prefix menu and try the different things. \xa0This sounded good to us until we noticed everything was chicken and my husband does not like chicken. \xa0I had checked the menu prior to making the reservation and knew it was mostly chicken but knew they had pork and duck. We asked her if could make substitutes and she went and had to ask. \xa0She tried to tell us that we could substitute one thing which honestly we're not sure what it was. \xa0My husband loves duck but he thought it was very mediocre. \xa0At the end of the meal we got our bill and she had charged for the rice and dessert even though she said it was part of the dinner. \xa0When we asked her about it she said that the special rice and the desserts we chose were not part of it. \xa0She did not tell us this ahead of time. \xa0It was not the money but the principle of the whole thing especially with the disappointment in the dinner and service.Basically if this was a real Michelin restaurant I would have expected the manager or ma\xeetre de to come over and welcome us and go over the menu since we were new comers. \xa0The price was \xa0about $70/person for chicken lol. \xa0We had expected to drop around $500 or more but this was a horrible experience for all of us. \xa0Considering I had to give my credit card to confirm that we were coming the place was pretty empty. \xa0Now I know why and we are very disappointed to find that Michelin gave this restaurant a star for 4 years in a row. \xa0Maybe they are being treated differently which would really be a disservice to customers." u'The omakase is the way to go. Truly an authentic Japanese experience from the layout of the restaurant to the service to the food to even the bathroom! Felt like I was back in Japan. Head Chef Atsushi Kono took good care of us and explained all the dishes. Was an intimate dinner and we had a blast. Definitely crazy full by the end of the meal. My favorite of the yakitori were the arteries and the chicken oyster. But funny enough my favorite part of the meal was the appetizer plate. There were two pieces that stood out; duck uni and shiso bite and a chicken pate/truffle umami bomb. Both incredible!As for the desert would highly recommend the three creme br\xfbl\xe9e. Early grey black sesame and roasted green tea. All delicious. Also tried the shiso sorbet. Mm. While I love shiso and I mean really love it this was too much. The br\xfbl\xe9e is the way to go. Great sake options but be prepared to spend a pretty penny for the really good stuff. Overall great experience and worth the cost.' u"Enjoyed a late dinner here at this Michelin star restaurant.Still the best place for yakitori in NYC imo.Get a counter seat and watch Chef Kono do his magic.Good to know that they now offer Chef's select counter omakase (includes sashimi and tempura along with yakitori).Going to try that next.Excellent service as before.: 8 calendars" u'So when did yakitori become all fancy-schmancy? I remember when my mom used to make it on her rotisserie set with chicken tenders she bought at the Piggly Wiggly. I use to chew on them straight off the skewer but given the wait staff was intently staring at Jamie W. and me I avoided that approach here. Truth be told I had never heard of this place until I saw it on the most recent edition of Eater NY\'s 38 Essential Restaurants list. I was looking for a place to dine before seeing an off-Broadway show a few blocks away and figured an hour-and-a-half window would be plenty of time for a reservation.It\'s almost hidden on West 53rd near 9th and when we entered we were forewarned that a dining experience would take at least two hours here. Oh. I explained we had a show to see at 7:30PM so they trundled us up to the vacant dining room upstairs. We felt perhaps our casual dress motivated them to quarantine us away from the other customers but in hindsight I felt like we lucked out with a private dining experience with our own dedicated staff. Even though we went through the voluminous menu we followed the advice of the Eater NY writer and ordered the $70 Chef\'s Omakase for each of us.It amounted to several small dishes and eight sets of skewers. But first we needed some sake a $47 carafe of Midorikawa which was cold and crisp with hints of vanilla and apple that made it the perfect accompaniment for everything that followed (photo: bit.ly/24BNEN9). Things started quietly with a bowl of pickled cucumbers and daikon (photo: bit.ly/24BNuoY). Fresh but nothing special. The creativity picked up considerably with the so-called seasonal dish which was an artfully displayed grilled chicken thigh with micro-chips made from the skin nestled with grilled fava beans and bits of red and yellow peppers (photo: bit.ly/24BOpFR).It was a gorgeous dish almost too pretty to eat. Almost I say since it was tasty. The yakitori parade began from there with a pair of "Meltingly Tender (Chicken) Belly Skin" skewers their marketing not mine but accurate and quite unusual in texture (photo: bit.ly/25NhWlN). Then came a pair of skewers with Whole Chicken Hearts my favorite part of a giblets pho and never seen them look so uh organ-like (photo: bit.ly/1U8sUtn). The third pair of skewers were Chicken Thigh Fillets perfectly grilled and plump with flavor (photo: bit.ly/24BNh51). Interestingly they served a bowl of Grated Daikon instead of rice and it worked since it provided a bit of crunch to all the tender meat (photo: bit.ly/25NinwD).A vegetable break was next with first Grilled Shishito Peppers on skewers (photo: bit.ly/1RXQTHr). I had a similar skewer in Tokyo\'s Piss Alley (Omoide Yokocho) and this was just as good. Then came a plate of Grilled Wild Mushrooms not on skewers but resting on a plate (photo: bit.ly/25Niecm). The yakitori highlight came next with the Sot I\'y Lasse or Grilled Chicken Oysters on a skewer (photo: bit.ly/1XGKskF). A chicken oyster? Yes that\'s what I wrote. It\'s the two small round pieces of dark meat on the back of a chicken near the thigh. We were told to pop them whole in our mouths and savor them quickly to get the full flavor. Quite tasty and over far too soon.Interestingly we received the one non-poultry skewer duo next the Grilled Pork Belly which was just as luscious as I was hoping it would be (photo: bit.ly/25NOMzx). Our final skewer set finally arrived and it was Chicken Meatballs which were oddly anachronistic to the refinement that came before but tasty nonetheless (photo: bit.ly/28msIOA). The server encouraged us to order a side dish so we just went with the $6 Grilled Edamame just to ease our wallets a bit (photo: bit.ly/1TX5y81). Then came our rice bowls. Jamie had the Soboro Don (Ground Chicken over Rice) (photo: bit.ly/1RXRKro) while I went for the heartier Oyako Don (Chicken and Egg over Rice) for $5 extra (photo: bit.ly/22TyC62).Both came with bowls of you guessed it Chicken Broth with a touch of miso (photo: bit.ly/1WFVRAq). There was even a little post-dinner amuse-bouche in an Omelet Square with Asparagus Tip (photo: bit.ly/1YfEHcn). Stuffed? Oh sure but we still had room for a small scoop of refreshing Shiso Sorbet an intriguing herbaceous twist to a minty granita which earns the nickname of "Japanese mojito" (photo: bit.ly/22TAdbX). Believe it or not we were finished with our meal in about an hour and a quarter plenty of time to catch our show. Fancy-schmancy yakitori? I can dig it..FOOD - 4 stars...quite a presentation for mostly chicken meat on a skewer and surprising versatility in flavors and textures AMBIANCE - 4 stars...hidden away in the upper dining roomSERVICE - 4 stars...attentive bordering on obsessive...but they were nice while they staredTOTAL - 4 stars...$70 for meat on a stick? oh sure why not...' u'We had the Omakase at the yakitori bar which included 3 appetizers 6 meat skewers 2 vegetable skewers 4ice bowl and dessert. \xa0We ordered the wagyu small plate to start. \xa0It was 6 pieces of perfectly cooked beef with a side of wasabi and soy sauce. \xa0Everything was brought out at the right time drinks were asked to be refilled just as we finished them. \xa0I highly recommend this restaurant. \xa0We got an early reservation to avoid the rush but if you sit at the yakitori bar when its full you will not feel crowded. \xa0There are four different sections of the restaurant which are completely separate including a regular bar and sushi bar. \xa0And of you like those automatic toilets check out the bathroom.' u"Make sure you love chicken as that's what yakitori is! We sat upstairs where it's more private however there were two families with screaming babies sitting next to us. I had a headache within 10 minutes of sitting down and was ready to leave! I mean who brings babies out at 9 pm anyways? Shouldn't they be in bed sleeping at this hour? The service was very good our waitress was polite in explaining the menu and helping us pick out a good sake. I really enjoyed the Uni dish and my dates favorite dish was the chicken thigh skewer. All and all it was pretty good but I don't believe it's Michelin star worthy." u'Beautiful. Fantastic. \xa0Been to Japan and this is the only experience I\'ve had in NYC that nears the level of the yakitori bars in Shinjuku\'s Yokocho side-streets and allies.Unfortunate to see reviewers here make complaints like "it\'s not as good as Gyukaku" or "the portions are too small." \xa0 They don\'t get it. \xa0"It was too greasy" was another that stood out. Since the chefs are grilling your food and not frying theres no additional "grease" being applied. \xa0That "grease" you\'re tasting is actually the delicious juice of high quality chicken. \xa0 I kinda feel sad for these folks.' u"Worth every penny!Came with my cousin who is a regular on a Saturday night. We got seated in front of the chefs that he knows. An awesome atmosphere quiet and upscale.We ordered the omakase menu (pic) - the only things we have to decide between are iberico pork or waygu beef and which oshokuji (rice/ramen) to get towards the end of the meal1. Amuse - Today's seasonal dishSalmon sashimi - we started with a plate of really yum salmon2. AppetizerSeasonal sashimi grilled seasonal food homemade chicken pate and crab miso and a special pork belly topped with truffle (this is my favorite) At this point we've moved on from Sapporo to sakeScallop soup came after - it was unforgettable a little on the salty side but it was really goodddd3. YakitoriWe had so many different parts of chickens for yakitori i skipped all the organ ones but my cousins said the chicken liver was to die for all of the yakitori are really above average and their mushroom was awesome!! they also have different refreshers in between yakitoris and that was awesome4. wagyu beefThe beef was really good not as amazing as the yakitori though but definitely great5. Seasonal tempurawe had sea bass in the tempura and it was really good i was expecting more vege option that comes with it though..6. OshokujiI picked the grilled rice ball with chazuku which is essentially rice in soup it's average i've had better but at this point i'm really full already. They had the mini ramen and loved it7. DessertWe picked 3 out of 5 options: - shiso sorbet - so good!- creme brulee with three flavors: green tea black sesame and rose tea - my favorite was the green tea and then the black sesame but it was really delicious- strawberry tiramisu - the thought of it made me crave it so much right now too bad it's seasonal and runs out quickly but it's definitely one of the best desserts i've ever had!Service was phenomenal sake was awesome (a little overpriced) food was exceptionally good not sure why it only has three and a half stars but I would definitely come back again multiple times!" u"Before coming here just make sure you're really into chicken. \xa0Your sentiment on that may help determine how you feel about the $$$$ meal.I am not a huge fan of chicken except the innards and weird body parts like wings gizzard feet heart etc etc. \xa0And disappointingly my omakase didn't include any special chicken parts. \xa0According to the waitress you're not guaranteed any parts so I can't be choosy. \xa0But anecdotally I was not pleased to see parties that arrived after us served far more interesting looking fare. \xa0I know Japanese restaurants tend to treat long time customers a little nicer and that's perfectly fine. \xa0Unfo it just made my meal overpriced and not quite worth the hype. \xa0There were some very well done pieces and the thigh meat (chicken oyster - totally not the same as Rocky Mountain oysters!) was amazingly juicy and tender. \xa0But not sure I'd personally pay $$$$ for yakitori unless I get to eat some unusual parts...The highlight of the meal for me was by far the dessert. \xa0There was a yuzu cookie that tasted amazing with moist but slightly crispy texture that makes the first bite a total pleasure. \xa0The souffl\xe9 was also good complemented the chicken well.Service was very good until a large party was seated near our table after which point the waitstaff completely forgot about us. \xa0Hey maybe it was an off night maybe a supply crunch that day in the chicken exotics or maybe you'll be more passionate about chicken skewers that you won't care about the other stuff. \xa0But personally the place didn't quite live up to my hopes." u'Went to Tori Shin May 15 for dinner. Again one of the BEST meals one could ask for! Had an amazing scallop small plate should have ordered 2! Also get the avocado. Anything you eat here will be top quality? And delicious. Wish I lived closer!!!!!' u"Came here on a trip to New York and was not prepared for the deliciousness that I was about to encounter. For a chicken fanatic I was doubtful I'd taste a skewer that was really all that different. Boy was I wrong. Every delectable bite was out of this world. Even the mushroom yakatori was amazing. If you make the trek make sure you don't skimp out on the Uni appetizer and chicken chasu. It was literally the best chicken chasu I've ever eaten. It was so good that I had to order it again before my meal was done! I opted not to get the omakase because some of the chicken parts felt off putting to me but I'm sure they would be delicious. It's no wonder they are consistently Michelin star ranked. Also their toilet is straight from Japan with tons of buttons and fancy features." u"Definitely get the the yakitori combo! They were well seasoned and you can also add a bit of spice yourself to kick it up a notch. I enjoyed every bite! One advice I would give to people who are afraid to eat the insides of an animal don't be. I'm also afraid but the yakitori served here were delicious. If it helps don't ask what you're eating. Have someone ordered or you and when the food comes just eat it. You'll love it trust me. It also comes with a rice dish I got the oyakodon which was nothing special...I prefer the one at Ootoya or Izakaya Mew.This place did seem a bit expensive...especially because there were supplements for ordering certain things...which destroys the purpose of a set. But I'm willing to overlook it because the yakitori were just that juicy!The two things I would say were not my top choices were the broiled sea urchin with garlic bread and the avocado with dashi and yuzukosho. The sea urchin was just okay nothing special and the garlic flavor wasn't evident at all. As for the avocado it was just way too salty and I LOVE avocados. I worship avocados. But they basically cut it in half took out the seed grilled it and poured the sauce in the center and that was all I could taste. Sadly (literally) our waitress was not the happiest person in the world. A bit TOO shy and soft spoken...and I feel like she just had the WORST day ever (or maybe it was her first day working idk). ON A HAPPY NOTE the restaurant is beautiful itself and the desserts are refreshing. Get the shiso sorbet!" u"We were first greeted by two very nice host and because our table wasnt ready yet we sat at the bar for a drink. The bartender wore a noce suit and enjoyed making the drinks often smiling and very gracious.After we were seated and welcomed by the staff. We opted for the chef's tasting menu and subbed in chicken liver and gizzard. The gizzard was a little too crunchy. However the liver was divine. Super silky and buttery. We ordered the scallop appetizer and it was pure bliss. The sauce was so good my boyfriend and I almost fought on who got the last bits of sauce up from the spoon haha. The wait staff was extremely courteous and helpful with details and their recommendations. The shiso sorbet was a great ending to a meal as it was very refreshing and light. Oh and the bathroom is very clean. And they have the high tech toilet which everyone should use it was quite an experience. The staff lights incense in the bathroom as well. Very pleasant." u"I'll try to keep this review simple: I love Torishin.A couple of things to remember: 1) Torishin serves primarily chicken + chicken parts. 2) Torishin serves primarily CHICKEN + chicken parts.3) Torishin serves primarily CHICKEN + CHICKEN parts.Now that that is hopefully drilled into you I hope you won't make a reservation and go into Torishin expecting beef and seafood skewers. Is Torishin better than the other yakitori joints in NYC? yea. Is Torishin cheaper than the other yakitori joints in NYC? no.Is Torishin fresher than the other yakitori joints in NYC? yea.Is Torishin tastier than the other yakitori joints in NYC? hell yea.Who is Torishin good for?1. People who are loaded. (not me.)2. People who love chicken. (me.)3. People who love food that comes on sticks. (me.)Who is Torishin bad for?1. Vegetarians.2. Penny-pinchers.*3. People who don't know how to make reservations.4. People who don't know how to read menus online.5. People who gripe about the omakase selection despite the rules that I underlined at the beginning of the review.*Actually it depends how you look at the value of the food. If you are on a tight budget (understandably who isn't these days) but you are looking to enjoy a nice meal I definitely recommend the omakase for value: it is a LOT of (tasty) food. If you can't splash out the $70/person (+$5 if you upgrade the rice dish for the famous oyakodon) +tip then wait. There is no shame in that.**If we're really going to compare yakitori places though I personally think that the portion sizes/piece at Torishin are much more generous than what you would get at another place. PLUS the quality is incomparable when we're talking about the fresh local free-range chicken used by Torishin. Sinfully juicy meat. Mmmmmm....It looks like this wasn't a simple review afterall." u"Yakitori omakaze!!Wasn't a big fan of yakitori until today.Never had chicken liver and this kind of tender texture with crunchiness juicy perfectly grilled yakitori before!! Heard its tough to make a reservation with the best chef here.. So hurry up guys~!" u'If you love yakitori this place is for you! I loveee Yakitori Totto used to be my go-to now this might be my new spot! We got the chefs tasting menu and was superb! A very special experience and reasonably priced for a tasting menu THAT unique. Uni crab brains truffles every part of the chicken imaginable and of course to top it off-GOLD sprinkled on half of the courses!That being said since we have tasted the best of the best that the menu has to offer we will probably not do the tasting menu again but most definitely be back for more chicken hearts chicken oysters \xa0and a couple of other delectables that I would only remember after seeing them.' u"The boyfriend and I came on a Saturday night as we celebrated being together for one year and haven't gotten sick of each other yet. He made reservations and we were seated promptly at our reserved time. The staff and the food were wonderful! We were specifically served by the head chef chef Kono. He consistently had a smile on his face and explained in detail about what we were going to be expecting and asked about our dietary restrictions. Chicken liver and chicken arteries were part of the omakase selection that night. The boyfriend's eyes lit up! I opted out of those two and at the chef's discretion he substituted with quail and chicken breast with shiso and sour plum. Both were incredible. The quail even made my boyfriend a little envious. I was feeling generous so I gave him a nibble. After the two appetizers and 10 skewers portion of the meal boyfriend and I were feeling extremely full and didn't know how we were going to fit in the chicken rice bowl but once it was placed in front of us the feeling disappeared and we were possessed and proceeded to the gluttony phase of our evening. The raw egg on top of the rice was so orange and fresh chicken was so tender and flavorful on top of piping hot rice which you're suppose to mixed all together. How can anyone pass that up??Had we not been full to the brim I would have gone for the 3 creme br\xfbl\xe9e dessert choice but instead I chose a scoop of sorbet as did the boyfriend. However on the way home I kept thinking I made the wrong choice. For $140 a person you definitely get really really full. Keep in mind they serve mostly chicken but occasionally there would be a pork or a beef item in the omakase. This place is definitely on rotation for special occasion evenings." u"Made a reservation here for 8:30pm but they called later to tell me they're overbooked/double booked so they wanted me to cancel or come in later. I could've made a reservation elsewhere but not enough time to make a reservation anywhere decent. Thanks a lot ToriShin for spoiling my Saturday evening! If you get people turned off before they even enter the door to your restaurant I say that's the worst experience you can have anywhere. I will not be returning and will definitely let everyone know not to go there."]
124.Wafels & Dinges,[u'Words cannot explain how much I love waffle desserts! Apparently this truck has an online tracker too so you can see where it is throughout the day! I ordered "de bom" cause I was feeling ice cream and it was SO GOOD. I did not regret eating the entire thing at all. Most items are $8-$12 on the menu - worth every penny.' u"Twas a cold winter morn when I ran into this truck. I smelt the yum could not turn away had to buy. I ordered the Leige wafel with strawberries bananas and chocolate fudge. Man was it amazing! Stuffed with da dinges (toppings). They didn't cheap out! Definitely sweet but I mean it is a dessert wafel. They had some savory options for you awful sweet haters." u"Waffles are about my favorite thing in life and these really hit the spot! I've always wanted to go to Belgium for the waffles and this is exactly what I imagine it being like. I got the thicker waffle (can't remember the name) topped with strawberries chocolate sauce and whipped cream. Truly phenomenal!" u"Delicious little treat. \xa0Love the texture of the waffle - slightly crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. \xa0I can't believe this is my first time trying this place after seeing it all over NYC for so many years. \xa0Very tasty stuff." u'Wafels & Dinges is one of the first food trucks to popularize in NYC. They specialize in sweet Belgian wafles but their menu has now expanded to include ice cream wafel cone and savory wafels which I have yet to try.I typically get the Liege wafel (vs. Brussels wafel). It\'s rounder sofer and chewier with pearl sugars embedded throughout for that additional kick of sweetness. "Dinges" are their term for toppings and it ranges from something sweet like spekuloos crumble and maple syrup to healthier toppings like walnuts bananas and strawberries. You should follow them on Twitter because they sometimes have a "trivia" for free dinges!' u"Well after a nice and relaxing stroll in central park the wife and I decided to have dessert at this stand. I had the PB and J waffle with powdered sugar on top double decker and was whisked to sugar heaven! My wife had Da bomb waffle and she refused to share so I'm guessing it was equally yummy as well. This place is pretty pricey but I guess that's the standard for food stands in this area. Giv them a try at least once." u"Absolute favorite food cart chain.I've been a fan since foreeeever (forever being since 2009 before they won the Vendy Awards) and truly watched them grow into the multiple vehicles they have now amassed and even running their own tours in Gowanus (highly recommend any fan to do that! It's like $5/$10 and you can make your own wafel!). I love the WMD - my recommendation is just to get the Liege waffle with any toppings your heart desires (and the speculoos please get the speculoos). I prefer the Liege over the Brussels as it is softer. The Brussels is denser and harder to sink my teeth into. If you want a waffle + ice cream creation get the speculoos ice cream. (SPECULOOS EVERYTHING ESSENTIALLY.)The staff are the cutest always smiling while making my heavenly creation. Tip: Look online as to how to get a free dinges! Usually it's a silly/random question/challenge. :)" u'This is a really great food truck.The wafels themselves are amazing. \xa0Great taste texture everything. \xa0By itself it would be a very high quality snack. \xa0Sweet and a tiny bit crunchy but with the perfect consistency/doughiness on the inside. \xa0The topping are applied very liberally.This is a strong 4 star review call it a 4.5. \xa0This place is great and jussssst shy of a 5-star experience. \xa0Definitely would recommend.' u"Great place to stop by when you're craving something carb-y and sweet. They have a mini waffle version if you're not very hungry also. You get two toppings I believe with your waffle! The service has always been super fast whenever I've gone also." u"Every time I have family come to town I bring them to the one on the corner of 5th and 59th...I think that's the cross streets. \xa0And every time I bring someone here they get in a fight over the one waffle they decided to get. \xa0These are warm gooey fattening and addicting. \xa0We love the WMD with ice cream." u'I was actually on the way to a Starbucks to grab a coffee and wait for some friends meeting me in a few when I passed a cart. The air around the area just smelled like delicious coffee and waffles and my business was quickly persuaded their way. I had a waffle with just banana slices as a topping and a latte. So delicious not overly sweet with just the fruit topping. It was a great choice and I will stop at one of these again soon!' u"This was the best Belgium waffle I've had in a long time. The s'mores waffle is very good but next time I'll have to try the other versions. I can't wait to come back!" u"My friend and I had some good wafels here but nothing amazing. With speculoos spread it was too sweet to taste much wafel and I was a little disappointed. Doesn't seem like enough effort is put into the wafel batter to make it stand-out delicious. I like the setting and location though!" u"Pros:(+) Waffles & Nutella?? Heck yes!!!(+) Spekuloos (+) Outdoor seating (+) Near Central Park (+) Inexpensive(+) Coffee & shakes (+) Option for unlimited toppings (+) Open lateCons:(-) None. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~My review is based on the cart. It used to be located at Columbus Circle but due to issues with taxis it was relocated here. I came here for a quick dessert to take home before hitting the train and was surprised that at 11:30pm at night they were still open! Yes!!Try the Spekuloos and Nutella - it's worth it. My fav is the Nutella with strawberries - yum! It's near Central Park so perfect to grab a dessert to take to the park in the afternoon. There is also seating around the area so you can just pick up a quick bite while chatting it up with a friend.If you're visiting New York it's worth the hype to try this place out. #waffelsanddinges #waffles" u"We had just finished breakfast and wanted to go for a stroll in Bryant park when all of the sudden a familiar scent blew our way. . It smelled like Belgian waffles. We had traveled to Brussels in 2010 and loved the waffles there \xa0so we decided to give this place a try. \xa0I was going that it wouldn't be some American version because those always disappoint. \xa0I've bite and it was obvious they it wasn't a knock off. \xa0We had the original waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. The waffle itself is very shift and chewy not overly sweet. The berries and cream are a good mixture and enhance the overall flavor." u"I see what all the hype is about. Their waffles have cardamom in there in case you were wondering what that interesting spice is. They have a selection of sweet and savory waffles too so don't come in thinking this place is only for dessert. I love that this place is very busy late at night. Yummy!" u'Quality authentic hot and fresh Belgian waffle with all the fixings and topped with fresh whipped cream. This is one of my favorite treats and luckily these food carts are very accessible throughout the city! About $6-7 and definitely worth the splurge. Big enough to share... Or not haha!' u"Wafels & Dinges is a food stand/truck that specializes in Belgian waffles. \xa0I happened upon them near Midtown. \xa0If you spot them you'll be in for a sweet treat.My Overall Rating - 3 1/2 Stars (Atmosphere Service Food Return)Atmosphere - It's a yellow food truck normally located in a public area. \xa0Honestly we were simply walking when we found them but you can follow them on twitter. \xa0I happen to love food trucks so I also love these setups where you can walk up place an order & get some tasty grub. There were a number of chairs & tables around so eating was easy. \xa01 Star.Service - There was only man in the truck but we fast & quick. \xa0Not much else can be said - our transaction to food time was no more than 5 minutes. \xa01 Star.Food - Of course we went with the WMD consisting of whipped cream chocolate syrup bananas & strawberries. \xa0It was super cold that day so unfortunately we didn't get to experience the hot soft wafel mixed with our dinges. \xa0Instead it was a bit hard - but the fruit (also cold) did soften it up. \xa0In the future I think I would rather order a wafel plain so that the flavor of the batter would stand out. \xa0In our WMD the other toppings over powered it. \xa0Hey we were ordering what looked good in the photos! \xa0Still a tasty treat but $10+ for a WMD & bottled water. \xa01 Star.Will I Return? - Only if I happen upon another food truck. \xa0I won't actively seek one out via twitter but if I spot a Wafel & Dinges cart I will surely line up. \xa0Not the best wafel I've had but certainly the best from a food stand/truck. \xa0You won't be disappointed if you are lucky enough to hit one up. \xa0 1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive? \xa0Perhaps an upscale place? \xa0No matter the type atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service. \xa0But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four. \xa0It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food since this is the main reason we dine out. \xa0Sometimes the extra star is given for value but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience. \xa0I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score." u"A nutella and belgian waffle lover's dream come true.Affordable tasty and pleasantly diabetic. Not a huge fan of their spekuloos spread. I normally get the Liege with nutella or belgian chocolate ice cream and strawberries. The ice cream just makes it perfect. I can never get sick of this place. I wish they came back to Forest Hills or opened up locations in Long Island as that would be much closer to me." u'Waffles for breakfast? \xa0Check. \xa0Belgian wafels? Double check. Had the breakfast special which was $5 for a wafel and coffee. Not expecting much I bit into a hot crispy waffle \xa0that was sweet and tender. It almost taste it like there were nuggets of carmelized sugar in it . Next time I would order one with ice cream for dessert... Or maybe for breakfast.']
94.Capizzi,[u"This was some of the best pizza I've ever had!! \xa0We ordered the delicious burrata appetizer (they were out of spinach rice balls or else we would've tried those) and the prosciutto and funghi (mushroom) pizza. IT. WAS. AMAZING!! The prosciutto was top notch and the cheese and sauce perfectly complemented each other. It's a fairly small place off the beaten path but it was well worth it. I totally understand why it has so many great reviews on Yelp!We had to wait about 15 minutes on a Sunday night at 8:45 PM but the staff were great about checking how many people were waiting outside and giving us updates on how much longer til we would be seated. \xa0It was absolutely worth the wait!If I lived in New York this would definitely be one of my go-to spots. The employees speak Italian (one said he was from Sicily) and the restaurant has an authentic Italian family vibe with high quality ingredients. If you have a chance and are looking for something more tasty and different than the typical NYC pizza this is your spot!" u"Let's talk about the dough first \xa0thin crust \xa0Wood oven pizza with a really nice burnt edge. We started and ordered 4 pizzas from the Margarita to the fully loaded.The Buffalo mozzarella was very delicious and the fully loaded pizza was sloppy but good. Really good The best was the 5th pizza we had for dessert. The pepperoni was good a little spicy for the Wife however it was worth the next 5 mile walk to work it off. Try it. It's good. Is it the best. No. Still worth the stop at Capizzi Rob from Toronto" u'I\'m an out-of-town visitor and have frequented this restaurant whenever I\'m in NYC. Capizzi is cute and quaint. I love their brick oven pizzas and their yummy salads. Ordered:Arugula Salad: ($10.50) My Fave: Arugula with tomatoes onions cranberries green apples walnuts blue cheese and the balsamic vinegar dressing. It\'s a light dressing and a delicious combination. Highly recommend this dish. Fennel Salad: ($9.95) It was my first time eating fennel but I enjoyed it. Another light salad. Not sure if I\'d order it again. \xa0Pizza:Asparagus Special ($19.99). Roasted Asparagus cherry tomatoes truffle oil pine nuts. Yummy. My friends and I are not meat eaters so this was perfect!Prosciutto and Funghi ($22.95): My Fave: Buffalo Mozzarella Portobello Mushroom Prosciutto and Parmigiano \xa0Reggiano Cheese. I don\'t normally eat prosciutto but it added flavor to this pizza. It\'s cut very thin and in my opinion that "made" the pizza. Our waiter recommended these two pizzas but there\'s so much more to choose from. On top of the 10+ types of specialty pizzas there are combination pizzas and build-your-own ones too. The staff has always been so nice and courteous to us. Thank You for your hard work.So if you\'re looking for a casual restaurant with delicious brick-oven pizzas I highly recommend visiting Cappizzi.......' u"This a cozy place with lots of ambiance and good pizza. It doesn't hold more than 25-30 ppl at a time so you may have to wait a little to get seated. You can enjoy a beverage while you wait. The sangria is good!" u'CapizziNY Manhattan Hells Kitchen9pm Wednesday 21st October 20155 StarsOn Back to the Future II day we came to Capizzi. \xa0This small restaurant is not in the best location next to grimy area near the Port Authority. However the place is warm quaint and filled with smell of delicious Italian food. We drank a couple Peronis ($6.5) while waiting for our pies. \xa0I had the Loaded: Provolone Pepperoni Sausage Bell Peppers Mushrooms Onions and Whole Garlic Cloves. The brick oven made the crust crispy with wisps of char. The sauce was sweet rich with the right amount of liquidity - not too watery but enough soften the slice. The toppings were plentiful and delicious. The deep roasted garlic flavor against the sweet peppers and spicy pepperoni was a fantastic combo. The service is more Italian laid back style. *they spelled "desserts" on their chalkboard unless they are selling some sand filled pastries.' u"I was expecting more from New York pizza and I have to tell you I had been recommended to go here and I'm pretty disappointed. Needless to say I got food poisoning. Pizza was super salty and the dough was undercooked. The sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce. Not impressed at all." u'Snapshot: 5/5 Service 3/5 Pizza 3/5 Price.Great vibe with decent pies. The service is excellent' u'Definitely good pizza. Sauce is delicious. I also really enjoyed the spinach rice balls. However they did not come with a side of sauce. I had to ask for it and they charged me. I ordered the Margarita Pizza with arugula. Yum.' u'We visited Capizzi with much anticipation after reading a handful of Yelp reviews. It\'s quite an unassuming establishment that probably seats no more than 40-50 people at capacity with a brick oven in clear view. Pretty casual atmosphere and there is a lot of nostalgic memorabilia throughout the small space.My wife daughter and I shared two pizzas. We ordered a marguerite pizza with olives and a pizza labeled as "Loaded". I want to be fair and honest in my review so I\'ll just say that I was disappointed despite my anticipation. The cheese was "clumpy" and it seemed like the pizza could\'ve benefited from more time in the oven. The sauce was not very memorable and overall consistency of the pizza was "soggy".NOW the Arugula salad redeemed the experience. The arugula was tossed lightly in oil with walnuts raisins and sliced green apples and there was enough for all three us of to share. The myriad of flavors made this salad quite a treat. I\'ll seek out other pizza establishments next time I visit NYC though.' u'Ordered a large Pizza Margherita for dinner with my family and there was nothing but enjoyment. \xa0Made with fresh pizza dough to establish a excellent base and real mozzarella cheese made for an excellent pizza. \xa0Also the staff was friendly and I did not need to wait long for my take out.' u'Great pizza! \xa0Tried one with sundried tomatoes. Excellent. \xa0Cute cozy little dimly lit place playing Frank Sinatra in the city. \xa0Works for me. Caprese salad was pretty forgettable but the pizza made up for it.' u'Oh yeah I saw Marlo Thomas tonight at the West Side Theater in a great play called Clever Little Lies and I wish I\'d taken her some Capizzi pizza as opposed to the red roses so many people dropped at the stage footlights!!! If you\'re under 40 you have no idea who I\'m talking about and that\'s not your fault! I walked into this place by chance and found the following: Brick oven decent little house wine list around the corner from a few theaters and a positively charming exterior and interior. This was a bit of serendipity as I was walking the streets while waiting to see above play at West Side Theater. The staff makes very good pies and they treat you like the family (yes in NYC and at 9th & 43rd no less!) inside this quaint wood-floored tile-walled pizzeria. With all the Italian-heritage kitsch on the walls I felt like I\'d walked into another era say 1946 or so. Nice. Oh yes the food: really delicious pizza great crust. The only way to order here is one-size personal pies 12". Lots of delicious toppings and clearly made with a passion for good pizza. I had the Prosciutto and Fungi (one of the menu specials); the server told me I had made a great choice and she wasn\'t kidding. I would order it again in a NY minute.In case you\'re wondering I could not finish my 12" pizza so for about 16 bucks I had a great meal. Cozy rustic romantic charming with a capital C and lots of food satisfaction.My only advice and the only thing that kept this review from 5-star would be to offer up a few more items on the menu like some creative and over-stuffed Italian sammies etc....' u'My husband and I visited New York for the first time in June for our honeymoon and we were staying right around the corner from Capizzis every day since we have left I have thought about their pizzas! We went two different times and tried a couple pizzas and they were both amazing and the servers both times were extremely friendly and made great suggestions. I would recommend the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the sangria! It is so good! Cant wait to return to New York and visit this delicious pizza joint again!' u"What an amazing little gem. The perfect pizza place we found using Yelp. Based on the reviews we had to give it a try and it did. It disappoint. The crust is perfect in flavor and the amount of toppings. I had the artichoke pizza special and it was so good not heavy at all even though it had a light cream sauce. My husband built his own with eggplant thinly sliced and roasted not breaded prosciutto and Carmelites onions. Perfect amount o cheese great service!We started with the spinach balls that we highly recommend. Don't focus on the high price they are worth it. And the homemade lemonade made fresh daily was pleasantly satisfying. Not too sweet or tart just perfectly balanced. Our new go to for NYC when we come to visit." u"Adorable little pizza shop hidden right near Port Authority. The tiny little one-room restaurant was empty enough around 2:00 on a Saturday that our party of five was quickly shown to a table. They brought us a bottle of tap water for the table and round wooden flats to act as plates. The menu is fairly extensive and although it says that their pizzas are all personal sized you have to be REALLY hungry to eat one of those all by yourself. We ordered three pizza for the table and that was plenty for the five of us. We had the margherita the asparagus and the eggplant. All three were excellent Neapolitan pizza: fresh mozzarella flavorful marinara chewy crust. Our waitress was actually from Italy which I suppose has to be a good sign. The only downside was that when it was time to pay they wouldn't accept our credit card as they said the machine wasn't working. We had to send a couple people out hunting for an ATM. Would have been nice to know in advance that this would be the case. But it's great pizza and a fun little place so give it a try but come with cash just in case." u'Hidden gem in midtown. Close to my office bonus points. The staff is nicer than sweet Apple pie which is nice and refreshing. We want here for lunch and got 2 pizzas which were just the right size for lunch and crispy crust piping hot goodness. The prices are also reasonable. It is a small place but nice d\xe9cor. Will be back for sure!' u'Super friendly employees and really good food! My husband and I had the margarita pizzas and they were delicious. We also had the Oreo cannoli which we loved!' u"3.5 stars. It's a gem in a very dirty construction-ridden neighborhood right across the street from one of Port Authority's many entrances on Ninth Avenue. We arrived for dinner on a Sunday evening and our party of 4 had to wait about 15-20 minutes to be seated. It's one of the only authentic thin-crust brick oven pizza in the area so we didn't mind the wait. The restaurant is just big enough to seat 25-30 people at any given moment and gives off a very cozy vibe with framed portraits and miscellaneous artwork stringing down from the ceilings. Don't feel pressured to dress up because this isn't that type of restaurant. We started off with the Arugula salad- predictable but a simple way to start the meal. They highly recommended we try their sangria so we did. But they do not offer them in pitchers. We continued with a few of their pies which I thought were too big to be personal pies but too small to share with another person. The crust was thin and a little crispy just the way I like it. Capizzi is a nice place to go to if you're in the mood for some decent food in the area while waiting to board a bus in Port Authority." u'Excellent pizza! This is a sit down place and my friend and I were in a hurry but we managed to get in eat and get out in under 20 minutes. The margherita is delicious and definitely enough for two people to share. Friendly service and reasonably priced for pizza of this quality! I would love to return and try the other varieties.Update 12/2015: \xa0the salad is a great deal - very fresh and tasty!' u'Small cash only Italian restaurant. Yummy burrata with prosciutto as an app variety of wines and tons of personal pan pizza. I recommend any on the menu or creating your own!']
93.E&E Grill House,[u"Good find in the middle of the theater district.For whatever reason this place was not that crowded on a Sunday night. \xa0Probably because of the Tony Awards or whatever but I still enjoyed my experience here. The food was above average. \xa0One surprisingly memorable dish was their french onion soup. \xa0It was well made the texture was just right and it was fortunately not too salty or greasy. \xa0That was one of the highlights of the meal. \xa0The kale salad was decent and I also thought their NY strip steak was good. \xa0I'm not sure if it was $38 dollars good but it was still a good meal.I also used the Yelp check in offer and was able to get a free dessert. \xa0Opted for the bread pudding and it was pretty awesome. \xa0The caramel ice cream really hit the spot on top of the bread pudding itself.If you're looking for a place with good ambiance decent service and above average food in the theater district this is a good option." u"We had family from out of tiwn normally I stay away from the Theater Dustrict hence my restaurant knowledge is lacking. I found this restaurant on Open Table we were in the theater Dustrict on a Friday night with people that were looking for close to the usual American Fare and for myself being Vegetarian options that catered to my palette. To my surprise hands down one if the best dinners I ever had.One reviewer wrote at first glance the restaurant appears small this us true but as you walk t b rough there is plenty of sesting where you are not on top of eachother.We started off with tbe Crab Cakes which were accompanied by homemade Cole slaw very fresh and not at all typical creamy slaw.I had the Salmon which came with saut\xe9ed Kale and I had to try the truffle fries. Absolutely amazing!!My girlfriend had some sort of steak which was accompanied by Brussel sprouts and Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes. I never had Brussel sprouts I have heard over time that they are not tasty well I am do glad that these are the ones I chose to try my first time they were prepared in such a delicious manner.One more very important thing to mention the best drink I have ever tasted if one enjoys Prosseco and Pomegranate-blueberry then the specialty drink Violet Beauregarde will not disappoint! They have a sister restaurant on the East Side and I Can not wait to try it! If the prices are a turnoff take into consideration that it's in the heart of the Theatre District so this is average for a good dinner and worth every penny!!" u'Came here during restaurant week on a Friday night a few weeks ago.Usually for restaurant week deals I would browse the menus before deciding which restaurant to go to. But a friend chose this place so I went with it.The restaurant was easy to find. Upon entering it looked nothing special other than like a regular restaurant but a little further back looked a bit fancier.I\'m not sure if it was because we came on a Friday night or our waitress seemed like the only server on the clock the service was really slow. It took a long time to order drinks then order our appetizer and entree then order our dessert then finally get our check. Anyway we ordered the restaurant week menu which you get an appetizer entree and dessert for $38. The menu had a truffle butter NY strip steak for an extra $8. I was very tempted to get it since I love truffle so much. I ordered an "oz-mopolitan" cocktail with my dinner which was pretty much like a regular Cosmo. We got bread & butter for the table which tasted pretty good. Not sure if it was because I was just hungry I ate 2pieces...lol. I started off with steamed mussels which tasted kind of plain to me. Then I ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes as my entree - the salmon was cooked perfectly in my opinion but the portion size was really big for me. I barely touched my mashed potatoes since I was so full probably from eating 2 pcs of bread.I ended up wrapping my entree up and getting my dessert to go - chocolate peanut butter mousse cake.If it weren\'t for restaurant week I probably would have never come here. But it was nice to try new places.' u"Decent place right across the street from the Book of Mormon. We got the burrata appetizer followed by the burger the tuna steak and the key lime pie for dessert. I enjoyed all four dishes but they were all pretty expensive for what they were -- there's no question you're paying for convenience to some extent and while that's totally fair (it's no more expensive than most of the other places in that vicinity) if it hadn't been such as cold night I would have been more inclined to venture out a bit and find somewhere better and/or cheaper." u'The service was great. I had the half of chicken with mashed potatoes. \xa0Chicken was moist and flavorful. \xa0Mashed potatoes were buttery.' u"We came here for a pre-show event for Misery on Broadway thrown by production staff and crew.Great service and friendly staff. Appetizers that were passed around were tasty. Good wine selection.Very nice decor in an upscale classy but welcoming way. Walls are adorned with pictures and posters of Broadway productions with many signed by the stars themselves.More seating in the back area for larger groups and parties.Very convenient choice if in the Theatre District to see a play or musical. They even had a sign inside letting people know that you can preorder cocktails during intermission if you're watching a Broadway show nearby and want to skip the wait and lines for the bathroom. A fun idea but not sure how it would really work when most intermissions are around 10 minutes.Didn't have a full meal here so can't really comment on the food. Might be worth a shot for a pre-show dinner or post show cocktail" u'Seared tuna as appetizer. Excellent. As well as the Salmon and Chicken wrap with avacados!' u'Amazing Filet Mignon (sauce was the bomb) & Grill Special ($38). Great service. \xa0French Onion soup was really good. $15 wine glass seemed expensive :(' u"We didn't have dinner so this review is just for the bar area/drinks. I went before a show. \xa0The host was very pleasant but I found it hard to get the attention of the people at the bar. \xa0The bartender told me the credit card machine wasn't working in case I wanted to go somewhere else. \xa0That was considerate but he was rather lame in all other service respects (including handing a dish of lamb chops to the lady next to me and not offering her a steak knife until after she started hacking at it with a butter knife).We were not offered a menu snacks or refills on our soft drinks.The bar staff also seemed unable to figure out the conundrum of how to seat a very loud couple from Australia (or possibly South Africa) because there were not two chairs together. \xa0How about asking the guy across the bar to take his computer bag off a chair and the single lady next to the bag to scooch over? \xa0That might work.The food I saw served looked great. \xa0The dining room was very pleasant looking as well... It was also relatively empty which made me very confused as to why they were refusing to seat people who just wanted a quick appetizer/supper before the show across the street. The show starts at 7... plently of time to turn a quick table before your set of 7:30 reservations." u'I love this place. \xa0It is my go-to place in my work neighborhood. \xa0Just...love. \xa0Tom the bartender - my fave.' u"Wow what a winner this place is. \xa0Very unassuming when you step inside the decor does not scream POWER FOOD but don't let looks deceive the menu packs a punch of flavor and sophistication. \xa0Hiding behind the almost spartan dineresque menu are very creative and artfully presented selections. \xa0Try the kale salad and tuna appetizer. \xa0The Hangar Steak was very nicely done but the absolute stunner was the sweet potato fries. \xa0Uh they are wonderful tasty crispy thin-cut fries that just happen to be made out of ....sweet potatoes. \xa0How many times have you had soggy floppy and clumpy sweet potato fries? \xa0Well E&E has the antidote it's almost worth a trip over just to sample these beauties. \xa0Can't wait to be back for another round of yummy." u"Had the French Onion Soup. Best I've ever had! Then came the Filet Mignon and it was very tender. Nice atmosphere right in Times Square! Great Salmon too!" u'When you walk in & at first glance the place is as small as a fast food chain. We had a reservation for 730pm but showed up an hour early and they accomodated us. \xa0Even though it was a tad on the busy side the waitress walked us to the back to another dining area which opened up pretty generously. There was even a curtain pulled to another section for a private party.The table we were seats at was 24 by 36. I measured because I\'m a husky guy. I guess if you\'re in New York everything is big except the hotel rooms bathrooms and restaurant tables. None the less we were seated and we\'re approached to order within a matter of minutes.We ordered the flier mignon but I added a lobster tail and asked for the corn off the Cobb as my veggie. They accomodated again but it was a $2.00 upcharge. Small pennies when ordering the most succulent steak on the planet. Oh and I also had the crab cake for an appetizer the yogurt & fruit and bread pudding for dessert.When the food came it was all cooked the way we asked. I was expecting a little more zip to the corn because it had jalape\xf1o in it but I guess it all evaporated once grilled.I don\'t know how much the bill was because I didn\'t pay but I know it was much less because we didn\'t order alcohol.I have it 4 out of 5 stars because of the size of the table we were seated at and how cramped the dining area felt even sitting at a table so small. I\'m 6\'3" 275 and need to spread out. Thay little table made me feel I was riding in a clown car with 17 other clowns.None the less the overall experience was wonderful. Highly recommended.' u"After posting my original review Amanda kindly reached out to address the concerns I had regarding the service. She was extremely apologetic about the experience and invited me to stop by again.I really really appreciated this gesture. Reviews overall for this restaurant have rated the service as excellent and I do believe my dinner experience may have just been an off day for the staff.Bumping my review up to 3 stars due to the attentiveness of management at E&E. Unfortunately I didn't find the food to be anything too particularly special and personally will not return. But thank you Amanda for showing that customer service is indeed a priority at E&E!Note: I also ordered delivery once from E&E with coworkers and wow the portions were tiny for the price. Just really not worth it when the food doesn't dazzle me." u'I checked in ordered desserts and coffees (there were 5 in our party) and showed the waitress the "Free Dessert" for checking in coupon on Yelp and was told that we had to buy a full meal (even though that is not stated anywhere on Yelp). \xa0I would say you need to read the fine print but there was no fine print to read. I think the restaurant just wanted a check in. Oh well here is your check in - with one star.' u'We walked all around NYC trying different places while we were there. This restaurant was the best hands down! They have the best steak!' u"Popped in here solo before catching The Book of Mormon. Nice atmosphere pleasant. I had the bone-in ribeye which was pretty good. Mashed potatoes were tasty but very rich. I ate them all and now regretting it. Not really a fan of the Free Dessert promotion since it's not accepted between 4-8pm. Not a fan of late night dinner. Not sure if anyone takes advantage of this." u"Extraordinarily convenient to Book of Mormon located directly across the street. \xa0Ambiance was great - able to have dinner conversation without having to shout. \xa0Food was excellent and generous - appetizers were wonderful (try the Ahi). \xa0Rack of lamb was magnificent served with an interesting side of saut\xe9ed kale. \xa0Our server Chris was great = attentive prompt personable. \xa0Margarita was just okay but don't recommend the non-alcoholic concoction of OJ pomegranate and blueberry. \xa0Highly recommend this place particularly if you're going to see a play anywhere near W49th Street." u"First visit on Sunday after an afternoon show. As soon as we walked in the door we were warmly greeted and placed on an excellent table in a little broadway inspired nook.We chose the prix fixe dinner at $39 per person. The waitstaff was friendly and very professional.Now the best part ...the food was incredibly good!! I had the pork chop (like almost two inches thick and cooked perfectly. My wife ordered French onion soup( which she said was one of the best ever) and the salmon..again cooked perfectly and delicious. The deserts were outrageous! Oh...and my wife's the non-alcoholic \xa0lemonade was perfectly tart while I had a draft IPA. I cant say enough about the E&E Grill House...and can't wait to go back! Jerry Morano" u'I came here to the bar after the Book of Mormon on Broadway which is fantastic. The bar was cool. Bartender Tom was tremendous guy. He took care of us. Then all of a sudden the STARS from the a Book of Mormon showed up and started have drinks. A cool bar + the stars of the best show on Broadway = good times! If you are in the neighborhood drop by and try the margarita!']
150.Pietrasanta,[u"I ordered delivery last night and the food was delivered hot and fairly quickly. The minestrone was great and the chicken parm was crunchy on the outside but moist on the inside. However the portion size was smaller than pictures of the food on yelp indicated and smaller than I would have expected given the price point of this restaurant. Also they have a VERY heavy hand with garlic in their tomato sauce. I love garlic but woah. I'd definitely order from here again.-1 star for portion size and overbearing garlic" u'Found this spot walking down 9th ave. delicious food and very attentive service. Definitely a great find!' u'Give this place a try! The Italian here is great! I came with my family around the holidays and we were not disappointed. Delicious food and moderately priced. They have a smaller wine list but have specials on the house wine.' u"Great food - especially pastas! Nice staff very clean bathroom (it's very important for me) Well it was one of the best dining experience in NYC. Definitely worth your time and money!" u"Stopped in on Mother's Day for dinner without a reservation after a show and the hostess graciously found us a table. \xa0Unfortunately the food was well below par. \xa0I had the special veal piccata which though tasty was not tender at all. \xa0 That was nothing however compared to the inedible chicken parmesan my son ordered. \xa0I was surprised when after a few bites he pushed his plate away. \xa0I tried a piece and quickly understood. \xa0No chewiness or taste at all. \xa0Must have been a bad piece of chicken because it was something more than tough. \xa0It actually broke into pieces when I bit into it. \xa0It was literally like plastic encased in breadcrumbs. \xa0 Disappointing because the sauce was very good. \xa0To the manager's credit when told he took the dish away and did not charge us. \xa0But our dinner was not very good at all." u"Small intimate Italian restaurant just outside the theater district with great homemade pasta. \xa0On a nice day they open the folding doors across the front of the restaurant facing a light on 9th. Busses park directly in front and the traffic is loud and horns are blazing constantly. You have to shout to talk across the table. We could barely hear the waiter. Then there's the truck fumes.It's probably very nice here in the winter when the doors are closed but not for me on a nice day." u'Good choice when looking for old school Italian in theater district. Everyone in group enjoyed their meal (osso bucco shrimp risotto baby octopus minestrone beet salad and organic greens salad). I had the baby octopus and it was in a tasty olive tomato sauce. Interior could use an update but service and food is much better than most restaurants in area. Good choice if you are seeing a show on 47th as it is on corner of 47th & 9th.' u"Took my two visiting daughters and three visiting grandchildren to Broadway to see a matinee. Afterwards \xa0we moseyed the few blocks over to Pietrasanta. This restaurant is perfectly located for pre or post theater. It's a comfortable place for well-behaved kids the pasta is homemade and the service is friendly and efficient (they recognize their theater niche). The ambience is basic NYC/Italian chic with folding outdoor walls that give you the feeling of being outdoors. And lastly the prices are reasonable." u'Another nice Italian restaurant conveniently located to the theater district.We were seated promptly at 6:00pm which was plenty of time to enjoy a nice meal before catching a show at 8:00pm. In fact it seemed as though the host was ONLY letting in folks who had a reservation to the restaurant so keep that in mind especially on busy weekend nights (we went in on a Friday).For dinner I had the orecchiette pugliese ("little ears" pasta broccoli rabe pecorino and sausage in a garlic wine sauce) and it was really delicious. The sauce was nice and light and the broccoli rabe tasted really fresh and not overly bitter. The caesar salad and bread I had on the side were equally good but the main course really stole the show.Overall a nice meal. Would certainly return again.' u"I was the only one in the restaurant having lunch at 2pm on a Wednesday. \xa0They brought out bread with balsamic and olive oil dipping sauce. \xa0I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta with tomatoes and asparagus. \xa0It was ok but nothing spectacular and the shrimp was a little overcooked. \xa0Service was good. \xa0I sat in the patio and witnessed some New York road rage but that was not the restaurant's fault." u'It was packed when we got there around 745pm. We enjoyed a bottle of wine and I got the spinach fettuccini with egg plant and tomato sauce instead of mushrooms I asked for spinach. My boyfriend got the Alfredo. They were really accommodating with food. The atmosphere was nice and simple but cute. Also the owner was walking around and made sure each person enjoyed themselves. It was great. I think our bus boy was having a rough day so he was a little moody but over all I loved the food and the over all experience.' u"This is a terrific little restaurant just a couple of blocks from the Theatre District that us perfect for a pre-show dinner (although worth going to any time). We had pasta dishes salads ravioli... All wonderful fresh and flavorful. Service was attentive and friendly and they had great sangria (bonus!). One point off for the interior which needs freshening but it's clean and warm and pleasant." u"Read a few of the other reviews and I have to agree when entering the restaurant the smell is awful! \xa0For some reason my chicken was extra chewy this visit and the service was horrendous! Waiter Pedro seemed more interested in his friend outside the restaurant versus telling us what the soup of the day was. \xa0Wish we had the other waiter not Pedro! This is the second time we've received poor service from the same waiter Pedro! Don't plan on patronizing this establishment again!" u'i have only been here once (so far) best little Italian place i have been to in this area i got the salmon and it was very good. table are small and u have very little space between your table and the ones next to you .. I plan to return Food- excellent service- excellent atmosphere - good ( not enough space )' u'Pietrsanta describes itself as "rustic" and "homey." \xa0But anyone using those words relative to this restaurant is either blinded by aspirational thinking or simply unfamiliar with the English definition of the words because it is anything but. Putting aside the noxious smell upon entering the bus boy doubling as a bartender eating a banana behind the bar (putting his half eaten banana and floppy peal down on the bar while mixing a sangria-like concoction for an unsuspecting couple being served rose like wine with fruit spooned into it from a Tupperware as the bar tender also nibbles on the fruit that dropped into the bar) the bathroom whose faucet just spontaneously burst and sprayed water on my daughter the wine list that boasts Yellowtail and other liter size bottles of delectable swill (there is one Pinot Grigio and a Chianti on their list which I guess is their homage to Italy) the fact that no one there seems to have any relation to Italy (except in so far as Cortez and Vespucci were both explorers of the Americas) the lousy food the stark and cold ambiance - I don\'t even think there was a cheesy picture of a gondola cheap laminated wood tables no music and an empty cafeteria style furniture arrangement I feel genuine sorrow for anyone who has given this place more than one star as their previous dinning experiences must be appalling \xa0horrific. Worth also noting that it\'s not close to being in the heart of the theater district as self described unless that term includes aspiring actors who share the neighborhood with bums and ruffians while living in shared studio apartments just scraping by in Hell\'s Kitchen hoping for their big break. Summarily - \xa0I see no redeeming quality to this restaurant and my head spins when I read the positive reviews here.' u'I had wonderful complete dinner here on \xa0a cold winter night last January.The service was friendly and prompt.I enjoyed salad pasta wtih clams and dessert. I thought for a Manhattan Restaurant the price was reasonable.' u"Excellent food and very comfortable despite the summer heat. The host and staff makes you feel at home. I had a generous portion of chicken parmigian a nice ceasar salad and tasty gazpacho soup! \xa0Their espresso beats starbucks across the street. The price is not bad if you're looking for a quality dining experience. I give it 5 stars!" u'Heard this was the place to eat before leaving New York. So ate here...had Risotto it was good. Sangria...ok. Service...not 18% worth.' u"It's not that the food is bad... it was quite acceptable. But noatmosphere. Place was like a tomb with indifferent staffLots more interesting good restaurants to try than this place" u"Food was great but the service was a bit lacking. I had the caesar salad followed by the Pollo Pietrasanta. The caesar was amazing and the pollo pietrasanta had a great flavor to it. The drinks were a bit off - I first ordered a mojito which did not taste good at all so I sent it back - I then ordered a gin and tonic which although it tasted okay was extremely strong and kind of took me out. It was hard to drink it was so strong! The server was kind of fly-by-night at times. He was not there when we needed him and drinks took way too long to get. However it wasn't a huge deal to me at the time because I was feeling pretty good from that strong drink!"]
126.Heartland Brewery Chophouse,[u"frm dallas TX and now this makes it my 3rd place that i have visit that i've given 5 stars.. \xa0Pros: great draft beer (lager w/lime) the salmon pepper/glazed (mmm good) and breautiful bar tenders both of them very friendly fast and know there beer when asked a question)Cons: humm still thinking.." u'I\'ve had many many burgers in my life but none better than Heartland\'s "Chop House Burger". For $15.95 it comes a with a pickle and Idaho fries. The meat is a well flavored mix of prime rib chuck and brisket. It\'s a perfect combination that melts in your mouth... To get the full experience I highly recommend ordering medium-rare with Swiss Cheese. If you\'re in need of an extra side I highly recommend the sauteed asparagus. Delicious!' u"I've been going here for years now but I think that is over now. This used to be my go-to place for bringing out-of-town guests - centrally located decent prices (for the neighborhood) and generally tasty hearty food. Unfortunately it seems a lot has changes recently and none of it for the better.I came a half hour before my party to put our names down and make a reservation for 6pm but were told that we couldn't be seated until everyone from my party was present. They wouldn't even let me put my name down for a 6pm reservation which I found very strange. As I said I've been coming to Heartland for years and that's the first time I ever heard of that policy. Then we get to the food. The quality and portions have gone down while the prices have soared. My husband's mini burgers were miniscule - they used to be much bigger. For almost $15 they were NOT worth the price. My pulled pork sandwich was pretty good but everyone else said their meals were just below average. No one seemed satisfied with their meals and my friend and I encountered other ladies in the bathroom complaining about the quality as well - so it seems we weren't alone. I got a side of mashed potatoes because I remember loving them in the past but what I got was not the creamy flavorful red bliss mashed 'taters of the past. Instead I got dry bland plain mashed potatoes. Then on top of everything else when getting the check we requested to break up the check separately between us and were told that they couldn't do that. Not only could they not do that but they could only accept up to 3 cards and that if we were going to split it between cards the split had to be even. WHAT??? I've never heard of such a thing before. What a bizarre policy. So for example my husband and I say spent around $60 between us let's say and another couple spent say $35 and another friend by himself spent $18 the total bill would be $113... but because we used 3 cards it would have to be split evenly $113 so that ALL three cards were charged around $37... despite the fact that that makes one party underpaying by $23 and another party overpaying by $19! How is that fair or make sense in any way? What the heck kind of policy is that to have in any establishment let alone a busy midtown Manhattan one? Suffice to say we balked and asked for a manager to resolve the situation and we were then told we could break it out by card. I just don't understand these new and bizarre policies particularly with the card situation. So with that and the poor food quality this will be the last time I visit the Times Square branch. I visited the location down at 34th back in October and that one was still good so I think from now on I will just be heading to that one instead. Very disappointed." u'Came in for a quiet lunch around noon.I was crazing buffalo wings but settled for Buffalo Spring rolls and the Sesame Wings.Both were delicious.This place is a bit on the expensive side( Thanks Times Square). It was $14 for 10 wings but they were definitely pretty meaty and cooked well. Great presentation too.The Buffalo Chicken Spring rolls were also very very good.They have a great beer flight where you can try 5oz of 6 different beers for $15 or you can try a pint of any combination of beer/cider mixtures for $8Overall great experience' u"Food was fine but had a really rude waitress (younger brunette girl we sat close to the kitchen can't remember her name). It got to the point where she was insulting us in a passive-aggressive way. There was absolutely no excuse for her behavior - we ordered ample amounts of food and drinks to help with her tab total for tips wasn't demanding and wasn't rowdy. Will not go back again." u'Great place to grab a beer in the midst of the madness of Time Square. My type of pub and ideally the type of place to wind down after a crazy day and enjoy one of their homemade craft brews. Great service and prices plus a great welcoming feeling that caters to all with a bit of something for everyone.' u"We had the nachos and chicken tenders. The nachos although they aren't authentic have a good flavor. The chicken tenders were very good. The servers are super nice! We will definitely go back. :)" u"I wanted to like Heartland Brewery as the place looked nice. \xa0However the decor doesn't always means great food.The pretzel as an appetizer was good. \xa0However I didn't really care for the dipping sauces. \xa0I had the steak frites which was largely plain to be honest. \xa0The steak was without spices and therefore without flavor. \xa0No sauces were offered.My husband and his best friend order the mac n' cheese dish with bacon and chicken. \xa0Now that was good! \xa0I should've gotten that instead.Service was poor! \xa0Our waitress did not do her rounds on a regular basis. \xa0We had to flag her down several times to have our drinks refilled. \xa0The check took forever to arrive which then meant it took forever for payment receipts to be returned." u'Not sure about the rave reviews maybe there was an off day but my experience here the other night was merely "okay."Food: I ordered a spinach dip with steak and a slice of cheesecake from the fixed price menu. At $40 it was not terrible. Steak was cooked precisely the way I wanted it but lacked flavor. Cheesecake tasted like it was in the refrigerator for a long long time. The spinach dip with chips more than made up for it though!Service: this is an area that this place doesn\'t shine. There is an inflated wait time for tables - I was told 1.5 hours but waited 40 minutes or so. Additionally we had 1 guest more than expected but they refused to give us an extra chair. Thank you neighbor for giving us an extra chair so we could fit all five of us in that four person table.Decor: the place can get cramped because there\'s an odd system of table management - tables stay empty for a very long time. Artificial scarcity? Interesting approach.' u'Hands down - They have one of the best burgers in NYC. I went there first time today. Overall experience - food ambience and service was spot on. I definitely suggest this place. If you are catching a bus from port authority then plan to go HB and have their home brewed beer with awesome burgers. I bet it will make your journey more memorable.' u'Beautiful place - Very quiet right off East 34th Street and 5th Avenue... I\'m generally not in the tourist section however when you\'re with Friends that like the "Rush" of Midtown... Staff is on point and attentive - Diverse Staff and Patrons - I\'m amazed by the Level of Quiet...' u'Used to go after sign language practice with a girl. We split up a few months later and I never went back. Haunts me like a ghost.' u'Recommended by my coworker. Came for a pick up. The place looks pretty cool. Might have to come back next time for happy hour!I ordered the Grilled Lemon Chicken Breast. It was amazing!! Great for low carbers!' u'I wish I would have eaten here... read heaps of good food reviews. We stumbled upon this place while walking around Times Square. I saw the big sign "Brewery" and I was sold. Time to drink!I give 4 stars cause a pint of beer was really pricey. And overly spicy. I tried the regular IPA and the pumpin beer. And felt I needed a chaser of water to get the taste out of my mouth. Don\'t be alarmed.... some people like that flavor so I suggest you try it yourself!It was a nice big bar with a lot of space. It was busy and we were served quickly.' u"I didn't think it was all that special but we just stopped in for some quick beers and maybe had an app if that's even a thing there hard to remember all I remember was really enjoying the inside- but it was way too loud. \xa0 Took too long to get a drink but it happens.I dig their pumpkin glass though" u"Not sure how we ended up here towards the end of our day but we needed to rest our feets and have a drink so this is where we ended up. Only thing I can review from this place is their Pretzel! It was bigger than my head and served with a (horseradish) spicy honey mustard and cheese. The look on my boyfriend's face when it arrived at our table is the sole reason i give this place 4 stars. I didnt even try the beer!" u'The food was ok. The drinks were ok. It was standard bar food. We shared the nachos and the sauce was different.I had the tuna tacos and it felt like there was more taco then tuna. My father had the ribs and they were a bit dry. A friend of ours had the salmon and she loved it. So all in all not a loss. But the service was phenomenal! Victoria our waitress was a treat and made the evening fun. Thank you for taking such good care of us.' u'Such a great place! We started with a few brews and an app- the buffalo chicken spring rolls (to die for)! After ordering the mac & cheese which was just as amazing we shared a lava cake for dessert! Another perk- this place is located in the bottom of the Empire State Building (which we realized after seeing people lined up on the side of the building)! How cool! Bruno is an amazing waited and catered to all our needs! Go see Bruno today! Highly recommended!' u"If you love a good craft beer and classic pub food THIS is the place to be! I would definitely classify their food as high quality pub food that is still reasonably priced. If you choose not eat but have a strong appreciation for craft beers I would definitely recommend grabbing a few friends and enjoying some of their very own brewed beers while socializing. Working in Midtown I love going and trying new places. However the Heartland Brewery will always be my 'go-to' spot!" u'Great place. We were seated quickly. Typical bar food. My whole family liked what they got.... The fettuccine Alfredo teriyaki salmon fish tacos and the buffalo chicken salad. Good beer too!']
104.Ageha Sushi,[u'I like it - I have been twice for sushi lunch after not really finding a good place near my work. \xa0They have some interesting choices and basic lunch bento is about $13. \xa0They are pretty quick with service but it was also pretty empty both times I have been so that may be why.It is definitely comfortable inside and quiet - again it was not very busy either time I went though.' u"There are a lot of servers working in the restaurant when my friend and I walked in which meant it had fast service. \xa0We were given a table immediately with menus and water and sat down. I've never experienced this at a restaurant before (Guess I'm a bit of a peasant) but when we got in the servers actually gave us wet moist towelettes to wash our hands off. I wasn't completely sure how to use it and at first started washing my face (It was hot out okay?) before I realized it was really just for my hands. We ordered some sake that the server poured first for us in shot glasses (not the traditional glasses) and then proceeded to look at the menu.It was extremely diverse with so much variety! The worst/best part was that there were photos everywhere so I didn't know what I really wanted to get! We ended up ordering two rolls the Ageha and the Manhattan roll. The Manhattan roll was to die for so good. SO GOOD it was soft and felt like it melted in my mouth. The eel was cooked just perfectly and nothing about the roll was too chewy or crunchy. The Ageha roll was delicious if not for the asparagus (kind of a weird thing?) which gave it a bit of texture.All in all the food was AMAZING and delicious.The only thing I found kind of uncomfortable was how much it felt like they were trying to rush us out. Every time I looked over they would be staring at our table and as soon as we were finished with anything they grabbed the dish and at the end immediately gave us the cheque." u"My go-to sushi spot in Hell's Kitchen. Always a table open always fast friendly service.Typical NYC sushi eatery decor: dark with neon lighting.Fresh well-made sushi rolls. Angry tuna snow white and spicy heaven rolls are among my favorite special rolls (throw jalapeno on any type of fish and I'll love it and eat it). Can't go wrong with any of the regular rolls.I've tried (nearly) every other sushi place in the nabe and this is by far by tried-and-true favorite." u"Sushi craving satisfied - but I wish it was at a better place. My friend and I went on a Thursday night around 8pm so it wasn't crowded. We were seated immediately. The decor was nice but I felt a little cramped inside. For appetizers we ordered the sushi pizza fried oysters and the duck. Sushi pizza we only ordered because we thought it was interesting and fun but it was not good. It just tasted like mush. I tasted nothing except spicy mayo. The fried oysters were very bland and boring. The duck was the best part. It's similar to peking duck but it was wrapped using burrito wrap. For main course we ordered four different types of sushi rolls. We tried to order very different ones but they all tasted the same. I was very satisfied too full to even finish the rolls! I would try the place again but this time with all new appetizers!" u"Went on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm for a late lunch.We ordered 4 specialty rolls:Hawaii Roll 15.00Tuna salmon yellowtail avocado inside ikura on the top*This was my favorite roll because I love ikura and there were copious amounts of it!Angry Tuna Roll 16.00White tuna and Japanese inside blackened tuna avocado crunchy tobiko and scallion on top with special sauce*There was too much going on in the roll and the flavors got lost in it.Happy Mango Roll 16.00Blacked tuna jalape\xf1o avocado inside spicy salmon and mango topped with chef's sauce wrapped with soybean seaweed*I think the goal is for this to be spicy and sweet and it was much too saucy and soggy. \xa0FYI this is a VERY large roll.Amazing Roll 18.00Spicy shrimp avocado crunch inside salmon tuna yellowtail mango uni avocado on top with chef sauce.*Again the flavors seemed to get lost. \xa0Interesting texture with the creaminess of the avocado and the crunch inside. \xa0I love uni but this was very low quality it was much too creamy but not in an umami way. It was more than enough for two people each roll was 8 large pieces and we had about 10 large pieces left. \xa0I wish we had only ordered 3 specialty rolls which would've been a perfect lunch size portion. \xa0My suggestion maybe go for the simpler rolls because I wasn't too impressed with the specialty rolls.We ordered strawberry and mango bubble tea which was pretty artificial tasting I wasn't a fan.Service was fairly consistent with the meal so no complaints there. \xa0We were sat at a 2 top but there wasn't enough room for our 4 rolls because they were plated individually on very large rectangular plates." u"Delicious food and great sake but I have a mango allergy and after eating a sauce my throat started to well. I even declared to our waitress I was allergic and she assured me my food didn't have mango in it. Kind of sad they don't pay attention to details like something this serious thankfully my allergy isn't as severe as a anaphylactic shock but a swollen tongue and throat isn't ideal and super uncomfortable." u"I came here \xa0based on Yelp's review totally loved it. It's not a high end sushi place but it was clean and relatively well done restaurant. Very welcoming atmosphere. We had rocket shrimp and shrimp papaya salad as starter then Chef's Special Sashimi Platter and Super Sashimi. Sashimi here are very fresh and the cut is also pretty generous. Certainly gonna come back here again and will also try their take out to see if it's as good!" u"Okay so I was in the mood for sushi and yelped the nearest location with an overall decent to better to decent reviews.......so far this place has been amazingly on point. It's a little on the expensive side but the food is fresh and good. Note I have only done take out but wouldn't mind doing a sit down session the staff seems helpful and attentive enough and the decor is your Westside standard for Hell's Kitchen. And I think they have a liqour license.......always a plus.So for the time being they are my resident sushi fix when I have it." u"Food: 1.5/2 starsOverall the food was delicious. We docked .5 for the beef negimaki ($10). It was a little too overdone and too much scallion to beef ratio. The miso soup was easily one of the most flavourful we've had. The spider roll ($11) had little rice vs the fillings so that was great! The salmon lover($25) was delicious. Great quality but I personally would've preferred more nigiri instead of the crunchy salmon roll. Service: 2/2They were attentive especially with refilling our drinks. The food came in a timely manner. We heard them explaining and giving recommendations to the table beside us. Although we were good and didn't require help. Overall: .5/1For lunch on a Saturday it wasn't over run by tourists. A nice simple place where you can have great sushi at a decent price. We would definitely come back here if we are in the area. Overall score: 4/5 stars" u"I traveled from CT \xa0to eat some good sushi & this place did NOT disappoint ! Great restaurant staff ! \xa0Loved their Tuna Belly (So fresh !) they had a great mixologist that made me a Lychee Martini & special sushi rolls were delicious ! Can't wait to come back !" u'Ageha is a solid choice for a sushi lunch in Hell\'s Kitchen without having to wait or fight for tables. \xa0Perhaps it\'s because it was a Friday before a holiday (Christmas) but this place was pretty much empty except for our table and another.For $10.50 you get your choice of two rolls + miso soup + salad. \xa0For $14.50 you can choose 3 rolls. \xa0They also have lots of hot combos and bento boxes to choose from at various prices as well.I ordered the two roll combo - spicy salmon (I asked for the "crunchy" part to be taken out) and salmon avocado - my usual go-to rolls at any sushi restaurant. \xa0The salad was a standard iceberg lettuce mix with a standard though tasty ginger dressing. \xa0The miso soup was actually good - not too salty. \xa0The rolls were delicious - packed with decently fresh salmon. \xa0I was especially impressed by the spicy salmon rolls... they were some of the better spicy salmon rolls (and proper spicy!) that I\'ve had in Midtown.There was a hiccup with an order in my party - someone had ordered an eel roll and got a salmon roll instead. \xa0They graiciously let us keep the additional roll at no cost. \xa0Yum!Service was decent. \xa0She did manage to pour water literally all the way up to the rim of the glass though causing us to drag the cup and slurp our water... how funny. Not.I would most definitely come back to Ageha for my sushi lunch fix. \xa0Best lunch deal for the taste in town!' u"Each dish was more innovative and interesting than the one before it. I don't remember seeing such a diverse and comprehensive menu anywhere. Near all the Broadway theatres. \xa0a wonderful experience." u"Loved the variety of rolls they have here and they're all so unique in both ingredients and names. I wasn't incredibly hungry so I had the New Sushi Sampler and an Alaska Roll. They ran out of California Uni or else I would've added that to my order too. My boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken and rice and it was okay the chicken could have been more tender. My sushi sampler was delicious each piece had its only style and sauce. The best one in my opinion is the tuna nigiri with the avocado and seaweed. The sauce is sweet and it compliments the toppings very well. My Alaska roll was okay the salmon quality was great but the sushi rice was dryer than I'd like. Thai iced tea was great I had two of those and their green tea mochi ice cream was a great end to my meal." u"Bring your stomach. This place is usually full but the staff is great about level setting expectations of the wait time involved. Good sushi go to place in midtown/ Hell's Kitchen area." u'I\'ve been to the restaurant a handful of times. It\'s a solid spot for when you don\'t want to break the bank at Masa Gari Morimoto blah blah blah. It\'s a cheesy restaurant with your run of the mill decor. You don\'t need to dress up. And most of the patrons are younger kids who live in Hell\'s Kitchen. It\'s owned and run by Chinese folk so their menu includes Americanized Chinese dishes such as Orange chicken and steamed fish. Some of the waiters have heavy indiscernible accents. And the boss lady is almost always barking orders. One evening we were on Seamless and decided to order $75 worth of sushi/sashimi for delivery. As soon as we placed the order we received a Seamless text and email informing us that our order was on our way. 2-3 minutes later I receive a phone call from a 212 number and somehow knew that it was probably Ageha Sushi. I picked up and it was the boss lady. She asked "This is Ageha Sushi. Do you know we are 20 blocks away?" I said "Excuse me. Hi. Sorry can you repeat yourself?" She said "We are 20 blocks away from your apartment. Did you know?" I said "Yes. What is the problem?" She said "We will need you to give our delivery boy more tip. You only put down $4." I said "Excuse me?" She said "Please pay our delivery boy at least 20% of the bill." WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED TO FREE DELIVERY? I am not tipping your delivery boy $15.You should pay your delivery boy a better hourly wage if you don\'t want him to complain. I asked her to cancel my order. She said she would. A week later I still had not seen the return transaction on my Credit Card so I called Seamless directly. Seamless reps told me that the restaurant never called to reverse the order. SO DISAPPOINTING.' u"Quality food great service. Been there quite a few times since it's close and the consistency is there. Great for a small group or 2!" u'Excellent fast and delicious food. Their sushi appetizers bento boxes desserts and boba drinks taste as good as they look. \xa0The wait staff are courteous attentive. A great place to enjoy a meal prior a Broadway show.' u"I actually found this Hidden Gem on Yelp I am so glad I did they had amazing concoctions that I've never seen before in my life like a sushi Pizza which was Tuna on top of a scallion pancake all of my roles were super large and extra fresh they even had bubble tea and a nice selection of desserts the yellowtail jalapeno appetizer was extremely fresh and jalapenos they use for extra spicy which I love I will definitely be going back soon" u"By far the best sushi in hell's kitchen. Delivery is fast. Sushi is fresh and generous portions. I get the salmon don or pieces of salmon and they are huge and perfect. They always remember to give me brown rice. Also love the rolls and rock shrimp. Visit the restaurant in person as well it is cute clean and service is great. Perfect for eat in or take out." u'Came here with a friend for dinner. The service was friendly and quick. We each had three roll combos. Everything was fresh. I particularly enjoyed the eel cucumber roll. The salad dressing was excellent. They also serve a very nicely presented orange at the end of the meal.Plan to return.']
13.Amorino,[u"BEST & BEAUTIFUL GELATO I've ever had!! My favorite flavors go to PISTACHIO and SALTED CARAMEL!Regular cone with flower gelato is about $7 and you get to choose 5-6 flavors. No artificial flavor all natural! I choose passion fruit strawberry dark chocolate pistachio salted caramel and vanilla. Crepes and Macarons look good too. I should come back here.Staff was very friendly and helped me to figure out the flavors! It's open late so you can come after the Broadway shows jazz club dinner night out! It was crowded at night I passed by and looked so good so I came back next day afternoon while no body lined up. Lucky!" u'What a lovely concept. I got a mix of three flavors. It was so hot out that I had to eat everything very quickly to prevent melting and the flavors sort of blended together.' u'The best Gelato in the city !!!I always get this gelato when I am by Times Square So fresh and yummy Also if you want you can ask them for a taste! Everything is so good My favorite was Pistachio and Strawberry!!!' u"Whenever I'm in the area I will go here spend a few hours while working (thank you for being able to charge my phone and iPad so I can continue to work).Comfy chairs nobody hassles me. There's a great selection of amazing ice cream beautiful flavours. \xa0 Their macarons are chilled never had that before but it tastes good. \xa0 The only thing I do notice is a constant change in staff. \xa0 That's not always a good thing..... Other than that I'll be back because it's just super convenient for me!" u"Some Yelper posted a photo of what looked like a flower but it was an ice cream cone a flower gelato cone to be exact. \xa0It was from Amorino on 8th Avenue & 45th Street I must pass it two or three times a week how come I did not notice this \xa0Boutique before? \xa0Must be I'm to busy dogging the local street characters tourist and brain dead commuters on my way to the PABT to have taken notice. \xa0Well I needed to find Amorino \xa0because my sensitive side likes colorful flowers and these I can eat the people behind this Idea must be geniuses. So I go and realize a blind man could find this place and I need to learn how to chill while walking down Times Square so I can appreciate the uniqueness of NY. Well I get there and see 2 dozen flavors of gelato and sorbets. You can order cups cones and take home canisters. They also have some breads and desserts like Pandolce a sweet bread like Panettone. Tarts of Sicilian lemons and almonds. \xa0Macrons and Waffles. Now to order gelato you pick the size small medium large of the cup or cone and you can pick and combine all the flavors you want yes \xa0ALL THE FALVORS YOU WANT !!!! \xa0So I asked for a cone with Ginger and Blood Orange  Cocco Puro Sri Lanka \xa0Mango Alfonso d'India and watched the Gelato Barista patently construct my flower by applying the pedals on the cone one by one until he created a beautiful flower. \xa0The way it's made is the cone has the center filled with one or more flavors and then the different flavor petals are added to the outside of the cone so you need to lick these up first on a warn day and work your way in.As dumb as it sounds the Mango tastes like real mango the coconut was a little bit weak but the Blood Orange was on point as a matter of fact the ginger was making it a little to stingy for me and I didn't finish it. \xa0But it was all good and I need to try other flavors like Bronte Pistachio or Caramello al Burro Salato and some Panettone so I will go back for more." u'We tasted their lemon pistachio chocolate and caramel ice cream. My husband loved their lemon but my favorite was pistachio ice-cream. Pro: taste and design of ice-cream is good. Con: servers are very rude!!' u'Ordered a chocolate crepe with cherry gelato and drifted off to heaven! This place is popular and there was a line but all worth it. Happy Yelping!' u'The gelato and sorbetto were very tasty. \xa0I can certainly appreciate the flavors they offer as well. \xa0The location is great and the amount served was definitely a plus. \xa0Always nice when they allow as many flavors as you want!I did however feel like I was being herded like a cow whilst there. \xa0The way we were being told to move towards the end was a little less than friendly. \xa0Although they are a busy store near times square. \xa0They also forgot to give my two orders the gelato macarons. \xa0We asked for them after but they were just shoved into a cup and sort of broken after that. \xa0Sort of ruined the delicate gelato flower look we were hoping for but it was all still very tasty regardless.' u"SO GOOD!!!Presentation to quality of ice cream to the service. Everything was beyond outstanding. I went to the branch in the crazy center of time square area. But the shop was not at all overwhelmed. I was greeted immediately when I got in. Had some questions on the flavors and options the staff were very friendly and patient with explaining to me. I had the blood orange ginger (flavor of the month) coconut speculoos and caramel butter.My fave was the coconut (can still taste the flakes inside and the specuLOOSS OMG it was to die for.Comes in petals like a flower. I can't wait to come back again to try their other flavors!!" u'Came here twice two days back to back because I just liked the gelato and the atmosphere. The open front store has a decor of a Italian gelato shop not just Italian but I mean a shop from Italy taken and planted in the middle of that streets Times Square touristy atmosphere. Oh it always has a shorter or longer line depending on the day. The first day I went was a warmer day and it had a longer line and the second day I went had a shorter line.It might be the way you order choose a size or type of what you want your gelato in...cone or cup then pay and then you go to where all the bins are and choose your flavor. They have over a dozen flavors. I thought the Dulce de leche was sweet but not too sweet good flavored. I also thought the lime-basil was very good put a smile in my face being lightly awaken with the lime sour taste cold bit of tart and the not too sweet but mediocre sweetness giving the lime-basil a win win in balance flavors.Add a macaroon so small the size of a flattened golf ball at $2.30 - sure why not.The atmosphere to dine inside or the couple chairs outside added with the friendly service will bump Italy-gelato-shop in Time Square-tourist-hot-spot A+ in my book.' u"Not a fan of Ice Cream but as I was walking home after a long day I noticed a big crowd at the entrance to the shop. I decided to pop my head in and the flowers I saw on other customer's hands decided for me! You can get as many flavors as you want. You pay first for either a cone or cup and then request your flavors. When it was my turn I asked for the best 5 top seller flavors. The worker went back and forth between flavors and gave my flower when finished. Delicious taste after a hot summer day. Will be coming here again for a smaller cone but same amount of ice cream!" u'So good. The flower design of the ice cream actually serves a functional purpose allowing you to taste the mixture of the gelato easily. The flavor and consistency of the ice cream itself was perfect. Ordered the pistachio hazelnut and coconut. Amazing. Will definitely come back.' u'The owner is super nice and friendly! We got the medium size cup to share. You can get4-5 flavors in that size too. Got the straciatella pistachio gelato mango sorbet and the chocolate hazelnut. All super yummy. Loveeeed the mango. This store also has ample seating space which is super nice in the busy 45th st location.' u'I am not a fan of gelato but after having gelato here I may have to change my mind. I think I haven\'t had good gelato in the past and I was left with the concept that it was just "meh" ice cream.The sweet cream which tends to be a bland flavor in regular ice cream was absolutely delicious. It was creamy with a perfect amount of sweetness. I ordered a small cup with allowed me to try one additional flavor; cookie butter. Absolutely amazing combo. I would definitely return to this location as there aren\'t many ice cream shops around Times Square that isn\'t franchised like Ben & Jerry\'s and such. (Maybe this is also a franchise? - You catch my drift)Note to self: Next time I must try the pretty flower that every posts pictures of.' u'Wow even though this place seems like a tourist trap given the location and neighborhood their gelato is still amazing. \xa0And surprisingly the price was not nearly as bad as I might have expected. \xa0Go for the cone if you want that fancy flower sculpted gelato. \xa0It says you can pick any number of flavors? \xa0But it seemed like 3 was what most people chose at most. \xa0I was glad I got to pick out a bunch of flavors to try they were all fantastic. \xa0The workers are also really quick and efficient in getting you out the door with your gelato. \xa0The rose can take a bit more time to make though as they really make sure it looks great.' u'Great energy + bunch of diff flavors = Im in heaven!!! Ask for testers and pick your faves!!!!I wanted my gelato cone to have a serious flowery look so I added:- Coconut for middle- Rasberry for pedals- Pistachio for leafSooooo~~~ gooooood!' u'Delicious gelato and it comes in the shape of a flower of you order a cone! It also tastes good. :) I liked that you could combine multiple flavors in one order - I had lemon raspberry and lime basil all of which were good choices. Conveniently located in the theater district.' u"Quick protips:1. if it's really hot out the rose in a cone will melt very quickly - the cup is your friend2. The more the merrier is not always true - if you get a lot of flavors they end up mixing and not necessarily in great waysSalted Caramel: the salt and sweet are completely mixed in the cream base so the's no real flavor or texture contrast per se. That said the caramel has a solid burnt flavor and the thorough mixing creates an almost savory taste that's pretty good in my opinion. 7.5/10Pistachio: Not as deep or rich as the hazelnut flavor. More on the lighter and floral end of things. 7/10Hazelnut: Fantastic deep rich nutty good depth of hazelnut flavor. Nutella wishes it was as hazelnutty as this. 9/10Sweet Milk: Grainy very mild. Sweet milk flavors should be reserved for ice cream per haps. 5/10Passionfruit: Very bright and tart. It doesn't taste as sweet if you eat some of the other flavors first so if you get this I'd try this first. I think the balance between sweet and tart is pretty good. Very nice and fresh taste. 9/10Blood Orange: I was impressed that they captured some of the bitter flavors of the rind in this. The orange flavor was pretty spot on and the bitterness is a nice contrast to all the other flavors. 8/10" u"Love this place. They have a lot of flavors and the staff are patient.If you get it on a cone it comes out as a rose which is pretty. You basically purchase a size and the staff that makes your cone asks you which flavors you want. Usually I get different color flavors so my rose looks more appetizing. The pistachio was a miss for me though.My boyfriend really loved the chocolate gelati and the chocolate sorbeti. We'll definitely be back!" u"I have gone here twice in the last two days. The gelato really does come out like it looks in the pictures. All the staff members are a bit rushed and therefore seem a bit overwhelmed and pushy. However it's understandable considering they are able to get through lines of people weaving in and out of the store in a decent amount of time. And you'll need that time anyways to decide what you want! There's so many options here not just in flavors of gelato but they also serve crepes waffles and macarons! You are allowed to sample flavors and get as many as you want. The amarena is always messy and melty so watch out! The sweet milk was not as sweet as I had hoped. The biscotto was very cinnamon-sugary but very yummy! The coffee flavor is standard as is the dulce de leche. The pistachio is worth a taste. I wasn't going to get it originally but after sampling it I had changed my mind. The coconut flavor has actual coconut flakes in it.The macarons are filled with gelato and are very tasty! I ordered a crepe as well which the worker actually burned the first time because she was so hurried. However she made it up to me by remaking it and adding chocolate sauces and their homemade whipped cream which truly made everything better. This place is a bit pricey but worth a visit. All in all pretty pictures lots of options but very hectic."]
181.Russian Vodka Room,[u'Been here many times and usually bring friends visiting for a different experience.The infused vodkas are very good and depending on your tastes I recommend:(1) Horseradish(2) Mango(3) RasberryIt is a cheesy russian piano bar but has character and is fun.' u"An old standby in the theater district the Russian Vodka Room might be good for a meeting with Bruce Vilanch on an upcoming awards show but as a place to actually eat and drink things it comes up short. The Russian menu is relatively standard along with the inclusion of several American and European dishes for people who come to a place called the Russian Vodka room and are afraid to order actual Russian food. Not that my dish of pelmeni were any better than the ones you get frozen at Russian markets for a dollar or two they just cost far more. They have two beers on draft neither of which are Russian or particularly good. There's a large selection of infused vodka. They tend towards the sweet and really don't measure up to some of the more ambitious creations at a place like Masha & the Bear in Williamsburg. As they say this is one of those places you don't come for the food. A man starts playing the piano around 7. There's a faded elegance to the dark features of the bar. As the alcohol sinks in this seems like a perfectly fine place to the pass the evening." u"We stumbled upon this place before Jersey Boys. \xa0It's right nearby. \xa0We decided to eat at the bar because the bartender (brunette) was so cool. \xa0The other bartender used her hand to cover the holes of the martini shaker (that's so gross!). \xa0Luckily we had completed our meal by then.If you like Russian food this is a great spot. \xa0The potato latkes were crisp and not overly greasy. \xa0They came with sour cream but I wished they came with more than a dollop. The bartender was very pleasant when I asked for more. \xa0The chicken schnitzel was a huge portion. \xa0It was tender and juicy. I expected it to be flattened. It was suppose to have truffle flavoring and I didn't taste any. \xa0It definitely needed more flavor. \xa0I used my hunny's mustard from his kielbasa dish to add flavor. \xa0The salad and potatoes it came with were good.We were served our appetizer and meals at different times so we couldn't exactly eat our food together. \xa0I feel places shouldn't serve food until the food for all the people at the table is ready. Overall the bartender was great with serving us. \xa0We liked the live music that started at 7:30 on a Saturday. \xa0I'd recommend it but I would make sure the bartender doesn't use her hand to cover the holes on the martini shaker (once again it WAS NOT the bartender that served us with the long braid). \xa0If I saw that again I would never ever go back." u"I really enjoyed this place. It met all my expectations. The atmosphere is pretty awesome. Old dark but not divey. The bartender was really sweet. The infused vodkas were really delish. I liked the cranberry the best. The borscht was perfect. We ordered the perogies but didn't realize they were more like a puffed pastry than a polish dumpling version. They were just okay. We enjoyed the crab cakes and potato pancakes with smoked salmon. \xa0Overall def a cool place that I will be coming back to asap." u'I\'m not russian and I LOVED this place. A russian friend took me there and first i said like "what is this small and dark place" like I didn\'t expect too much for it but guys they made AWESOME food and the strongest vodka like they have the real vodka! After that I can say "NOW I really know what vodka is". And Jesus that russian salad and the pickles salad were so damn good! everything was good and the place inside is super cozy and the service is quick and good. Also they play jazz or other live music. I came back again there and I think im gonna go again and again. Super cool place with good food.' u'Great place great food and atmosphere! Nice music that both Russian and international...This place also has live music and piano:) very cozy and romantic environment as well! A must have their infused vodkas!' u'This was very nice food but somewhat overpriced. We got a couple appetizers which came out to ~$35. The piroshki was quite tasty--a trio of pastries with different fillings in each. I had never had a potato piroshki before and it was a nice contrast with the meat filling. There was also spicy filling which I did not try because I do not like spicy.The pelmeni were great. Usually pelmeni have tons of onion mixed with the meat but these had just the right amount. The only problem I had was the small amount of dumplings. Not enough to fill me up but too many (and too expensive) to order an extra round. Oh well. I highly recommend getting these fried. They are cooked like potstickers so they are crispy brown but not greasy or fried all over. The place was quite nice clean and with a piano player.One star removed due to the high price.' u"Came with a group of 10 co-workers and the majority of us came out unimpressed. \xa0Drinks: We shared a carafe of the grapefruit infused vodka and didn't find it any easier to go down than your flavored liquor store vodka.Service: The manager was very accommodating of our large group but besides that the service was pretty mediocre for the price range of the restaurant. \xa0The waitress didn't really take time to explain the menu always seemed in a rush and added automatic gratuity. \xa0They also only gave our table of 10 3 glasses of water because they ran out of clean glasses. \xa0Food: I ordered the beef stroganoff and had bites of the chicken schnitzel. \xa0The beef stroganoff was a little bit too creamy and served with a peculiar side of some sort of grain (seemed like a mix of rice quinoa and farro). \xa0The chicken schnitzel was mediocre at best." u"The two times I've been to this place it's brought me an insane amount of happiness. Maybe because I'm in the gorgeous city or maybe because I'm surrounded by vodka and Russian speaking people but whatever the reason it will keep me retuning each time I'm in New York. The live music just makes the atmosphere even more enjoyable. You can't go wrong with any of their speciality vodkas. But the horseradish one turned out to be a favorite. Just maybe don't order multiple shots of it or your next morning won't be too enjoyable." u"My attitude has a mind of its own....I just say what I think should be said...I need a vodka and cranberry as soon as possible...I got the sloppy dog ....Its was one of their specialty drink that was mixed with Russian vodka....it was delish!I will advise you to have a dinner before coming here for drinks! Yes there music and very friendly and perfect service! came here on new years day and this is surprisingly one of the bars that was open that day and it's really one of the best vodka drinks iv had in years..." u'Authentic Russian infused vodka. Cranberry is my favorite. They go down pretty easy but be aware it will get you drunk. In yet of food chicken Kiev is a classic.' u"I really liked the atmosphere of this place! \xa0It's low-key you can have conversations comfortably and I like the retro feel it had. I did not try the food but the drinks were really good (very strong though you have been warned!). I had the pomegranate martini which was delicious and tried several infused vodka shots. The happy hour is a pretty good deal. The service was efficient and polite! I think the bartender was Russian :). No complaints there" u'The absolute Best.Irina and the other lovely girl bartener are amazing.Homemade vodka the Best vodka ever.Smoked.fish roasted.duck this place is a winner in life.If you want the absolute Best night in NYC you need to bring your party to RVR. BFH' u'Easily one of the finest dining experiences of my entire life! The food was out-of-sight awesome. I got the beef tongue and pickled vegetables and my wife got the crab cakes. We both took one bite and looked at each other and were like "phenomenal". On top of that the young lady who served us was friendly and helpful. She even taught me some new Russian words :) If you\'re looking for real authentic Russian dishes than trust me when I say this you won\'t find a place better anywhere on the east coast. Two thumbs way up!' u"A lot of people don't know how good Russian food can be. We went here after a weekend matinee. Half-price drinks at Happy Hour! We enjoyed their homemade infused vodka (we both had ginger flavor) a couple salads and a smoked fish plate. Some kitschy old Communist party posters on the wall and a piano player playing show tunes. Is it authentically Russian? No it's better. By Russian standards the service was fantastic: the waitress was nice and seemed to care about her job. Also unlike Russia the place doesn't stink of cigarettes. We left saying we enjoyed it and would like to return." u"Always such a great time here! I love all the infused vodkas. They can be dangerous because they go down so easily. There's a great piano and jazz singer who performed and I love to listen to them. The food's pretty good too! But as the name suggests it's a vodka bar so that's why I go" u"Garlic Pepper Dill Martini. Thank me later.It's a midtown bar for locals with reasonable prices a chill vibe and tons of different vodkas flavored in house.You can get carafes of vodka -- yes you read that right I said carafes -- in any of their specialty flavors. Most of them are fruity like strawberry cherry apple pomegranate etc... but there is one savory standout: the Garlic Pepper Dill vodka.It tastes a bit like a mild pickle-juice without vinegar and a ton more garlic. Vodka flavor is completely masked by the infusions. If you like picklebacks you will enjoy sipping this martini.Live piano player plays soft classics and I'm not talking about REO Speedwagon here. I'm talking about Mozart Beethoven and Chopin nocturnes. It fit's the place perfectly with an air of refinement.We all know how tough it is to find a decent bar in Midtown and now I will be headed to the Russian Vodka Room when drinking near the low 50s in the future." u"The Russian Vodka Room is hands-down my favorite Manhattan bar. I heard rave reviews from friends (that's like analog Yelp) and had to check it out. Now I stop at the Room every time I'm in NYC.There's a great mix of characters here and true Russian authenticity. It's a tiny space that fills up very fast. Warning: the martinis are mean and strong - just the way I like them. I recommend getting the Filthy Russian." u"Walking into this place is like watching an old Russian gangster movie that was filmed in black and white. However the only shots fired were those that contained infused vodka......lots and lots of infused tasty vodka. Glass jugs of vodka with fruit up on the shelves all over the bar waiting until they reach the desired level of infusion. \xa0 Bloody Mary's with infused horseradish vodka. \xa0It is a small place with no windows lots of Russian speaking patrons. \xa0Fun place if you are with friends and celebrating or bar hopping. \xa0This was #5 on our stops so we didn't eat here we only sampled and we really enjoyed it. \xa0 A must try is the infused vodka sampler served in little glass tubes in an ice bowl. \xa0Hope to go back soon." u"I love the Russian Vodka Room. They have a great happy hour but the drinks are reasonably priced all the time. They have a live pianist playing during dinner hours and it makes for a lovely ambiance. You can see the vodkas infusing in jars around the restaurant which is super cool. Other than during happy hour you can almost always get a table in the bar area which was plush sofas and soft lighting. It's a great place to meet a friend or have a date. I especially love the pickled veggie plate!"]
134.The Cannery,[u"Shaggy the server kicks ass. Quick drinks and fast service. Overall atmosphere is great. Good music and the Windows stay open when it's nice out. Great people watching on ninth avenue too!" u"Came here with two co-workers went to play ball but it got rained out. This place does bars the correct way. I don't got this places that don't give free drinks. If I'm paying for several drinks one should be on the house; it makes no sense. We ordered food and all of our dishes were grand. I got the Cannery burger and it was splendid. My co-workers said their dishes were great as well. After we ordered several drinks the bartender told us the best shot was on the house. This made us all smile. Shit like this go a long way!4 stars!" u"I went here with a couple friends to grab a bite to eat and watch one of the hockey games on a weeknight. It wasn't very busy so we were able to be seated at a table in the back. We were interested in watching the hockey game so we asked to have one of the TVs changed but apparently some of the TVs in the back are connected to the TVs at the bar--sort of lame but we rearranged ourselves accordingly.To start off I had a couple bites of the nachos which were actually better than I was expecting. They have some sort of chili on it and chicken that was nice--though the store-bought salsa could have been upgraded.For my main meal I got a plain burger with a side of Brussels sprouts. The burger was alright--cooked well but not much flavor overall. The Brussels sprouts were literally just steamed--something I haven't experienced in a long time as most places these days do something to spice them up a bit. Nevertheless they tasted fine but were nothing to write home about.Overall this place has a ton of TVs and some of the food is good but I was very unimpressed with most of the meal. In addition though the waiter was somewhat attentive it was mostly to ask if we needed any more drinks--which felt a little pushy IMO." u"Dope spot (TVs everywhere!!!). The lady and I came across this spot off a deal thru pulsd.com and we were impressed. The food was good (we both did the Benedicts bacon & short rib). Service is top notch here. If you come by make sure to ask or look for Shaggy (tell him Messiah sent ya). The deal is great for $35 you got a great size portion meal (the menu has plenty of options: Eggs Benedicts Omlettes Pancakes steak & eggs etc) and bottomless drinks (bellinis mimosas screw drivers & bloody Mary's). The food was prepared well and the eggs were poached perfectly. The drinks hit the spot and weren't watered down (you'll probably feel a buzz on drink #2). Ps: Don't forget to look for my guy Shaggy" u"I came here for lunch with a friend with the Pulsd deal ($35 for 90 minute bottomless brunch for two). We were seated and our orders were taken quickly. The restaurant had an open storefront which I'm sure is awesome in the summer but I thought it was still a bit too cold for that. I ordered the Mexican omelet and my friend ordered the breakfast quesadilla. I noticed that the portions were bigger than usual for these brunch deals which we loved. The drinks were pre-made but didn't taste watered down at all. They were small compared to other boozy brunches but you can have as many as you want so it's not a big deal. The food was excellent. I probably would never fork up the cash for bottomless brunch without a deal but I would definitely come here again-- to both eat and drink. I saw that the kitchen is open until 2am! Also next to Empanada Mama which is temporarily closed but when it opens again can make for great drunk food after spending some time at The Cannery." u"I found out about the Cannery through a Pulsd deal - $35 for two entrees and a bottle of wine. So I decided to nab the deal (after consulting Yelp of course) and head on over on a Friday night. Plus it happened to be a few blocks away from a Dueling Pianos show that I was going to see that night.I don't know if people are just unwilling to roam into Hell's Kitchen if it was too cold or maybe just a combination of the two. But It was pretty empty for a Friday night at around 7 especially since they have happy hour ($5 well drinks select drafts and wines) until 8 pm. Or maybe if I visited on a Thursday I'd be complaining about how packed it was. Either way it wasn't a bad thing. It was quiet but not too quiet. Plus all of the food and drinks came out really quickly so no complaints there.To start we had the poutine (fries topped with pulled short rib Fontina cheese and Guinness brown sauce). The fries were just your standard bar food fries. The Fontina cheese tasted more like shredded mozzarella. The rest was just mediocre pulled meat soaked in gravy. There was a hearty portion of meat on there but it wasn't good meat. Also I don't know if they should be advertising this as poutine as there were no cheese curds in there. You should probably skip this one. You're better off ordering cheese fries - I'm sure those would taste better.For my entree I had the fish and chips. But since I just had fries as an appetizer I asked if they could sub the chips for a salad (I know I'm the only idiot who asks for fish and a salad instead of fish and chips. I'm sure the waitress thought I was crazy). The dish came with three pieces of fish which I actually really liked. They were perfectly fried and didn't taste like frozen fish sticks. Plus it came with a small thing of cole slaw.My boyfriend went with the lobster ravioli which I'm almost certain they didn't prepare there but surprisingly it was actually really good! You can taste lobster chunks in there. I'm also a sucker for vodka sauce which could have been why I liked it so much.The bottle of wine was a choice of cabernet or chardonnay (or was it pinot grigio?). Either way it was just a cheap bottle of drugstore wine. I wasn't expecting anything more and at $35 for the deal I can't really complain.I used to work in the area. Had I found out about this place back then I probably would have frequented it more often. But now that I'm all the way downtown I doubt I would go out of my way to come back here." u"Finding a down to earth place in NYC to have brunch for a party of 30 seemed nearly impossible until I spoke to the warm and friendly folks at the Cannery. Everyone i came into contact there was sweet as could be helpful and absurdly good looking. They made throwing an engagement party weekend brunch easy as could be and everyone of my guests commented on how relaxed the family pub style atmosphere made for mixing and mingling while enjoying their respectable bloody Mary's and very nice Bellinis. Generous portions and service with a smile made the experience one that will have me back very soon. Thank you everyone at the Cannery. \xa0You made it so easy. And that's not so easy to find in Hells Kitchen." u'Out of curiosity are there any women who work here? (didn\'t see one)Two stars because the service was simply basura. I came here today (4/3/16) and though our server was nice he didn\'t do a good job at all with keeping up with our table. He took a long time to give us our drinks and even longer to take our order for food. In summary my guess would be that anytime you come here you will "consistently" be confused. I say consistently because this is the word our server used when I asked if they leave pitchers on the table for those opting for the unlimited drink brunch and he said no because they "consistently" come around to fill your glass. This "consistently" did not happen as we had to flag him and anyone else who walked by down for a refill. Now the confusing part is the place was not busy AT ALL and our order came out wrong. And the server was not at all attentive the entire time. How? Lol. . how does this even happen when barely anyone is present. Anyway the California garden burger was good. The service "consistently" not.' u"I went to the Cannery during a work trip. I am usually alone for these trips and I like to try places that I can't get home. The menu online seemed interesting and they had Brussel Sprouts and I LOVE brussel sprouts. My menu selections did not disappoint. I had something call Pig Pops (petit pork lollipops-YUM) and the Brussel Sprouts delicious. Each was very good. My servicers were attentive pleasant and professional. My main server had a training shadow and props to the shadow she fixed my uneven table. The place was pretty much empty which is probably why the new age 'Cheers' atmosphere stuck out like a sore thumb. The bartenders had a loud but great rapport with the customers at the bar. Did they acknowledge me upon entering? No but I was not giving them money to dance either but whatever. Anyway if you like loud rowdy pubs with mad love for the regulars that they share with everyone in the place you will love this place. Maybe I will do a take-out next time there were some interesting menu items I still want to try.Should you go? Give it a try. The place is a good size nice bar space set up with lots of TVs and the food was good. The atmosphere was just not for me." u"My first time here was a awhile ago when it was just transferring from Stecchino to its new name. So I came back with my husband for brunch to see if the change did the restaurant well.It has a typical pub like atmosphere. A decent sized bar and plenty of seating in the back. The best part? The ample TVs they have hung on the walls. Need a place to watch the game? The Cannery doesn't have one bad seat in the house!\xa0The only thing dissapointing that day was the service. Our waitress was great in the beginning; she took our orders right away and made sure to get us our first brunch cocktail ASAP! After that I'm not sure what happened. Now I usually don't look for 5 star fine dining service when I go to a gastropub but I do expect the basics. Once we received our meal I don't think she ever really came back to check up on us. The worst part we had to keep trying to get her attention to get a refill on our drinks. When it comes to brunch this is a big no-no for me. The service that day could have very well been an isolated incident especially since the first time we went our waitress was GREAT! I still give it 4 stars because our food came out quickly and I know they are capable of better service from previous experiences.Despite the service being underwhelming the food was pretty great! We ordered the Breakfast Quesadilla Steak & Eggs Short Rib Benedict and Bacon. The steak & eggs were the standout dish. Steak wasn't really cooked medium rare but it was flavorful and the eggs were cooked to order. The breakfast quesadilla left much to be desired taste wise BUT was very filling which is a plus when you are enjoying multiple drinks. The bacon was cooked extra crispy just the way I like it! The Short Rib Benedict was my favorite. I just love Eggs Benedict in general and the addition of short rib made my heart melt and my stomach flutter (so dramatic). The unlimited drinks offered are Bloody Mary's Mimosas and Bellini's. When I'm back in NYC I wouldn't mind returning here for brunch. It's a solid and affordable option. Hopefully service will be better as well!" u"I've been to this place three times and only had a good experience once m. Every time I go in here I have a problem with either slow to no service or something is a problem when it comes to paying. It just sucks because the food is good but that's the only thing this place has going for it. Last time I went there I order a happy hour drink and an appetizer with my friends who asks each ordered a drink and at the end when it was time to pay we wanted to pay separately with cards the waiter friend to tell us there was a $20 min for cards! What?! Yeah no thanks. After some talking she did the separate checks but it shouldn't take fighting with your waiter to get stuff done. Not a good place for groups at all. Bad service all around." u'What a great find!! \xa0Jacob the very attractive single financially stable bartender was the best you could ask for and the best reason to go to this bar. \xa0Best drinks in town and very entertaining. \xa0 Great vibe good drinks what more could you ask for. \xa0They also have a great clock! \xa0We will be back next time in NYC.' u'We got a pulsd voucher for brunch. While definitely worth the price with a voucher the service isn\'t the best nor is the food. \xa0On a quiet Sunday afternoon we came in while there were maybe 4 other tables in the restaurant seated and the bar was relatively full. There was one bartender behind the bar and one server. \xa0While the server was attentive in the first 5 minutes we were there it was a challenge to get our "bottomless brunch" drinks refilled and even to get water to our table. \xa0We had a total of THREE rounds of mimosas (the bellini was way too sweet) - the second of which was made with soda water. \xa0I would say it was lucky if that had even a splash of champagne as the club soda was prominent in the drink. \xa0The server explained that the orange in the gun was out and that was the culprit... it\'s difficult for me to believe that. \xa0As the food comes from the kitchen via a runner entrees arrived timely. \xa0We ordered the short rib benedict and the breakfast burger which was essentially a bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg. The burger was dry and not very flavorful - pretty bland actually. \xa0The short rib benedict was so-so but at least it was more flavorful than the burger. \xa0The hand-cut french fries that accompanied the burger were delicious though. All-in-all poor service bland food and a staff that thinks it\'s okay to sub club soda for champagne in a mimosa. \xa0I wouldn\'t return.' u"Great food great price for the neighborood and great service. There are TVs galore so you'll be sure to see whatever sport you're looking for - even if you're in the back restaurant portion." u'Just moved to manhattan and needed a family chill bar spot with great music...here it is! Shaggy made me feel right at home! Happy hour 5-8pm across planet fitness and best brunch cheeeehuu! Great service and amazing beer' u'Yelp gets it right again...Went to this place during the snowstorm. The inside is a very neat old-fashion brick wall pub/restaurant. The brunch special was $15 all you can drink on top of a brunch or regular menu item which was all under $15. The food was actually really good. The breakfast quesadilla was really good as were the eggs benedicts. Nothing spectacular or gourmet just solid fun and good food. Quality also was above average for a bar with cheaper prices. The drinks were fairly good and they came by often to refill the unlimited drinks. With that said the service here was actually spectacular. Our server was a brunette but a blonde lady possibly a manager was equally as attentive as was the Irish bartender who was walking around too checking on people. Great service.' u'Just stopped in here for a beer after a sports game and was very happily surprised! Super friendly staff and amazing happy hour specials! Shaggy one of the servers is especially attentive and made the experience great!' u"Great drink selection of cans and beers on tap. Friendly service. Unique cocktail list. Sweet open concept patio. Can't go wrong here in the summertime." u'Fun atmosphere and awesome food. I definitely recommend this place for a night out with friends. Denise is the best waitress!!' u'My favorite neighborhood spot. Live in the area and love coming here for brunch dinner and drinks. Denise is a great waitress!! Super personable and added to the experience. Definitely recommend.']
89.O’Lunney’s,[u'Good bar for after work drinks and a bite to eat. The space is HUGE and two sides. Be careful because it can get very crowded but there is ample seating for all!' u"I organized an event here and the people I spoke to on the phone were so misleading. I was told that they had a happy hour. They don't. Was also asked where we preferred to have it and I said the second floor and they said okay. When I get there the host tells me that they don't have a second floor. Then it turns out that there are two locations right next to each other and I'd asked to be in one and they put me in the other. This obviously turned out to be very confusing for everyone because some people went to one spot and some went to another. I wasn't even aware until a guest figured this out which made me look bad in front of my guests. I'm not sure why the manager or host didn't clarify this to me at any point during this process. You'd think they'd be more helpful to you if you're bringing them 40 guests. Oh yeah the fish and chips should be avoided. Three tiny pieces of fish and extremely oily not worth their overpriced costs. The chicken bites were way too salty. Mozzarella sticks are decent but who messes up mozzarella sticks?" u'Typical Irish bar food. Salad was food and generous serving. Fish and chips had a nice batter and fish tasted fresh. Mini crab cakes were mostly breading but served in a nice salsa. Presentation very nice. If you want a quick theater meal and good tasting Harp beer convenient location. \xa0Good service.' u'Stopped in for dinner one evening - very convenient location for those staying next door at the Hyatt Times Square.Sat at the bar and ordered a Shepherds Pie plus a pint of Lagunitas IPA and a glass of water.Enjoyed the decor - especially all of the dark wood carved with Celtic knot work patterns.Shepherds Pie came up fast. Was hot and tasty. IPA was good. Service was good. Restrooms are down a flight of stairs.They also offer breakfast here in the mornings - which I did not experience.' u"Great Irish pub in the middle of Times Square. \xa0Come in here for a cold pint and get away from the crowds outside. \xa0You can't really hate on something like this. \xa0It might be a little bit of a tourist trap but its still essential Times Square. \xa0Youre already coming here to be among the crowd and the advertising so come in here for a few drinks." u'Nice Irish Bar around Times Square. \xa0My wife and I came here for a pre-dinner Pint on Saturday night. \xa0It wasn\'t too busy and seems to be more of an up-scale Irish Bar. \xa0The bartender was very courteous and funny telling some knee-slappers here and there. \xa0We ordered two Alagash Whites and went on our way.. \xa0Good ole\' Irish Pub.. \xa0Their menu looked pretty good as well so maybe I\'ll try some of their fare during my next visit.. \xa0Oh and on our way out we were greeted by the host and were told to have a nice night and offered a very kind "See you next time...." \xa0I like that.. \xa0It\'s the little things that bring you back.' u"Love this place! \xa0Have tried most of the menu and it is always good. \xa0They also have a nice selection of beers and cider. Great place to bring out of town guests for dinner. \xa0While it is near Times Square it is on the east side and not as crowded and touristy. \xa0More of a local pub feel. Best part is the food is good and the service great! \xa0I have never had a problem getting in and if you are going to a show let the service staff know. They will get you in and out quickly. You can't go wrong with any of the Irish pub food items on their menu. I often meet friends here either before going to a show or after for a bite and drink. Noise level is not \xa0bad. I have always been able to have conversations without shouting. I highly recommend it!" u"Last day in NYC. We're in Time Square. Hungry.We happened to stumble upon this cute little spot on our way to Bryant Park. And I'm glad we did. Service was fast customer service was great and food was delicious. The price wasn't too bad I spent about $30 for 2 people. Sounds like a reasonable price especially for a spot in Times Square. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and he had the basic breakfast special. If you're looking for a place to grab breakfast or even a drink. Check this place out." u"Another typical Irish bar in midtown but this one seems more spacious than the usual ones.Came here for a company happy hour. The sliders and wings were okay. Nothing special but nothing to rave about. Plenty of choices for beer. Service was friendly it was hard at times to get the staff's attention though.Only reason this might be better than the other ones is the space." u'They were very accommodating to our large party and to their major credit they did not rush us out after we were finished despite it being the height of the lunch hour. \xa0While I felt my Cobb Salad was kind of meh and pretty small everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. \xa0If you are really hungry the Irish Breakfast seemed like a lot of food. \xa0From a food point of view I might try elsewhere but their friendliness and helpfulness earned that 4th star.' u'This place is the best! I love the servers here and the food is amazing.' u'Great atmosphere. Friendly Irish bartenders. Good variety of beers and liquor. Reasonably priced and not overly touristy. Very convenient to Times Square.' u'Curry fries... Oh goodness curry fries galore. Divinity!!! Shepards pie was phenomenal. Perfect blend of lamb veggies and mashed potatoes. Flavor was spot on! A great find amongst many many Irish pub options.' u'Love all the Irish Pubs in Manhattan.This was a great stop at 1 am for some grub and beer. The bartender took care of us:)' u'Nice Irish pub in midtown manhattan that gets crowded due to the after work crowd. There are some tourists because it is in Time Square. It is a little difficult to get an order in but the service is friendly.' u"Enjoyed a pre-theater dinner with my family at O'Lunney's. \xa0This beautifully decorated pub was located just across the street from the theater...so convenient. \xa0Our Irish server was sweet and competent and the food and drinks were excellent. \xa0Will definitely return!!" u"Awesome Chicken Pot Pie \xa0several of our group of 14 kept coming back \xa0 Also the bar tenders we're great This is a must bar to visit great service" u"I love O'Lunney's! \xa0This is our second time coming to NYC & O'Lunney's. \xa0This time we had the Shepard's Pie Sliders Cheesecake and Creme Br\xfbl\xe9e. \xa0Everything was delicious!!! \xa0I don't care too much for lamb but it tasted awesome in the Shepard's Pie. \xa0The wait staff was great. \xa0At one point we had 3 different servers but they were all on point. \xa0We are glad we came back and will probably stop in anytime we are in NYC." u"I never cease to have a good time and a good meal it's my go-to place when traveling into the city to see a show and where I have out of towners meet me. \xa0NY prices but that's to be expected. \xa0The burgers are always top notch turkey BLT is great. \xa0I love the Irish waitstaff and bartenders it really adds to the authenticity of the atmosphere. \xa0It's big clean beautifully decorated. \xa0Always a good time!" u"Just your average Irish pub. I had the chicken curry and it was okay nothing to write home about. Definitely worth going to for a drink and to hang out because of the atmosphere but wouldn't go for a big dinner gathering."]
56.Qi,[u'I came here on a Friday night and was promptly seated. This place has a great ambiance very nice for a date night. We ordered the short ribs as an appetizer and baby let me tell you how amazing these rings were. Very well seasoned with a semi sweet sauce they were very most and tender and fell off the bone. And we both ordered the flat noodles with the sweet sauce. It came with a great portion. It was absolutely delicious. And the prices of everything was very reasonable. I would definitely come here again and again. This is probably my new favorite Thai spot.' u"Everything was mediocre here. The food the service the atmosphere. I wouldn't waste my time although prices aren't terrible for Hell's Kitchen.The seafood in my Qi Bangkok was not fresh and the egg crepe it was wrapped in was kinda gross." u'I came here today with 3 coworkers (two were interns) and thought this place would be a nice lunch spot for a professional lunch. I left feeling disgusted and embarrassed for coming here.Service was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE to say the least. We walked in ignored for 7 min before the hostess finally decided to do her job. We asked for a booth (there were several available) and blatantly told "no". Getting water and having our order taken was a challenge. I asked my waitress 3x for water and she would nod but never oblige. She had such a rude face on and refused to smile. Portion size is laughable. Quality and taste is mediocre even though the wait was ridiculous. Do not go here. I would give it 0 stars if I could.' u"Second place in the city to have the best Pad Thai. Went there for the first time with a few friends for a farewell dinner and the pad Thai was excellent. Juicy fresh flavorful and enough.I'm giving them 4 stars because the service in general was ok. However the last waiter who took care of us was like in a bad mood asked for a table from us for the people next to us and they were tons of tables in the back of the restaurant. He also rushed the bill and suggested that more people are coming and since we aren't drinking we should move to another table. The food was good prices are very cheap the music was soft and not loud. Clean and chic atmosphere. But that specific waiter that I wished I had his name sucks. I'll definitely go back and ask for another waiter if he is the one taking care of my table." u'I used to go to the previous now closed location on the village this location is located in a higher pedestrian traffic Area easier to get to via Mass transit but the surrounding is very loud so is the restaurant atmosphere; the set up is not so comfortable I felt that we were sitting with the table besides us food was okay prices are okay and service is friendly. it is a good spot for a quick Thai meal.' u'First off I must say I haven\'t \xa0felt to write a review in years! I work in the area and use to love coming here both for lunch and dinner for the past few years. It use to be my safe place for friends family and colleagues. Their lunch specials were $9 just got bumped to $10 which is fine for the area. However the quality of the food also got bumped and is now unpalatable. 1) My food is now so bland and lacks all flavor if you order any of the curries the rice is significantly smaller than the regular one you would get with an entree.2) I asked the waiter why my portion of noodles were smaller although you increased the price of the lunch special and she said ask the manager. It was the owners decision. 3) I returned my Thai ice tea and asked for no ice because it tasted like milk water. I ultimately returned that as well because it got no better. I understand rent is expensive and business owners are forced with tough decisions. However degrading the "quality" of your product/food should NEVER be an option. Off course the place is still packed for lunch hours due to tourists and new comers however this place is no longer trending. What could have been one of the "NYC Spots" just became another fast food outlet with mediocre taste and inconsistent quality. I am forever a basic guy but this Establishment just got too basic even for me. There\'s a bunch of other restaurants a block away closer to 9th Ave - Hells Kitchen that didn\'t replace their respect for food and quality to cut cost and make more money. The customer service has always been excellent though ..... \xa0you\'ve been warned.' u'3 stars since it had lunch hour special every day! Our party of 4 were seated pretty quickly. we opted to get pad thai and paw mee dishes. The apps were good but the dishes were either lightly sauced or heavily sauced? Typical Thai food with good service. The downside was that me and my friend both had stomach issues about an hr and a half after a meal..' u'Delivery was a MESS. \xa0WE called twice and they still missed parts of the orders and included allergy items in some meals - from which they were asked to exclude. \xa0DespicableWill be complaining to the manager and they will not be getting my business again.' u"The location is pretty awful -overrun by tourists. I met a friend here for an afterwork dinner. We were seated promptly and our server was attentive with making sure our drinks were always filled. He was also very good about answering our endless questions about dish ingredients. They were busy so it was nice that he didn't rush us. I ordered the Spicy Holy Basil with brown rice and it did not disappoint. Overall it was a great dining experience but I wouldn't return based on location alone." u"This hungry lady had no idea where to eat. Especially around the Times Square area. And I knew I did NOT want to eat directly in the heart of Times Sqaure. I needed an area where it was less busy less hectic LESS PEOPLE. Thankfully my two NYers friends came to my rescue. Going back and forth between wanting Italian cuisine or American cuisine we ended up doing Thai instead. Because that's how an indecisive person like myself roll. *shrugs*My order: a glass of white wine Chicken and Shrimp Dumpling Qi Pad Thai (without the fresh mango). All of my choices ended up being tasty and satisfying choices." u"Another Thai place that saw both the traditional and modern cuisine combination. While we came in on Tue night it was not at all crowded and it was pretty spacious anyway. Shared an app and two entrees with the entrees of huge portion. Chicken pad Thai was of good quality and not too salty (unlike majority other Thai places).Interior decoration probably is their best selling point - it's like stepping into a small crystal palace with chandeliers hanging on the ceiling. Girls would love it!" u'Qi is my favorite place for lunch in the hood. The fried shrimp dumplings with tomato sauce and Kee Mao noodle are delicious!Today I have an important meeting at 1pm I walked out of my office which is half block away around 12:15pm. I ordered right away and then started doing my own things at the bar table. I renewed my points for the meeting I caught up the news of today I got so starved and impatient.... At 12:45pm nothing showed up on my table and I found it hopeless to be able to eat gracefully and walk calmly to the meeting. So I left a note on the napkin and left the place with an empty stomach. Very very very disappointed.' u"This place was just alright. The food just tastes like regular take out food. It is only worth the money if you go during lunch time when the prices are cheaper. The drinks are okay they were just very over priced- more than the meal itself). They were kind of rude because we asked to sit somewhere so we could have more room but they did not allow us to- meanwhile it was super quiet in there. We were then a party of 5 being squished at a small table. I wouldn't really recommend coming here the city has many other amazing places you can go to and really enjoy!" u'Qi gets 3 stars at most from me. \xa0It wasn\'t my choice but it was a sponsored meal by a manager so I obliged. \xa0Qi is located extremely close to Times Square - usually for me anything in the vicinity of the super-packed super-touristy Times Square area is a place I avoid.QI is a very nicely decorated Thai restaurant... which actually makes me feel a little weird because I want an authentic experience - I seem to feel more comfortable in a more cozy/homey type of spot like Pure Thai. \xa0Actually having visited Bangkok before I really enjoyed that experience and this "fancy" feeling atmosphere just didn\'t do it for me. \xa0BUT it IS really pretty!Service was bleh. \xa0We were in agreement all around. \xa0It took them halfway through our meal to bring my colleague hot sauce. \xa0They brought me ice cream with no spoon and it took me forever to flag someone down to bring me a spoon. \xa0Overall very very slow service with lack of urgency and they\'re definitely the type of staff who are just there to do their job and nothing more.I got the beef noodle soup combo for lunch. \xa0It came with Thai buffalo wings which were probably the best part of the meal - hot crispy and very flavorful. \xa0I would actually eat this again. \xa0The five spice beef noodle soup had a ton of meat in it which was a surprise. \xa0The broth was a little too sweet for my liking and they left massive pieces of star anise that I ended up biting into (yuck!). \xa0I realized that this probably would have tasted better with the traditional spicy powder but I don\'t think they bring that out unless you ask here... if they even have it. \xa0The green tea ice cream that came with the set was actually quite disgusting and tasted like nothing.While the lunch specials here are reasonable and there isn\'t usually a wait since the space is so big I would take the short few block walk and head over to 9th Avenue/Hell\'s Kitchen for much much better Thai food.' u'Not far from Times Square this location is actually nicely sized. The interior is beautifully decorated with a neutral color scheme large old world candles contained in glass and dim lighting to set the mood.The food was good consistent with Thai in NYC. I ordered spicy Thai fried rice with chicken- my go to entree. I enjoyed it. I ordered a drink called "Makarm" which is a blend of Makers Mark whiskey tamarind and lime ($13). It was really good. The female bartender making it was a little pretentious but as she was the only one working behind the bar at the time I let it go. Overall pretty good spot. Better than "Sea" that\'s for sure.' u"We were looking for a pre-theatre Thai spot and Qi worked out great.I have loved Thai food since I was a preschooler and while I have nothing against the American Thai restaurant classics like Pad Thai and Panang curry it's really easy to get bored of joints that only offer such popular classic dishes and nothing else. We picked Qi because it had a menu with a mix of Thai restaurant staples and more unique and authentic dishes all available at the same time and place.I had the Chiang Mai noodle soup a yellow curry broth packed with chicken flat rice noodles pickled cabbage onion and cilantro and topped with crunchy fried noodles. My dinner companion got the chicken pumpkin curry which she said was great as well.My soup bowl was giant and full to the brim. No sign of the common Thai restaurant problem where you get tons of curry sauce with a measly handful of vegetables and a few slices of your chosen meat thrown in.The ambiance was classy and a little clubby and the waitstaff was competent and attentive. The convenience factor and interesting menu make Qi an option for a return visit when I'm craving Thai in the theater district." u'This place is chic and fancy. I really like the extravagant clean feeling of the restaurant. I give the atmosphere and decor 5 stars. Though the place may seem small it looks like you can hold a large party if called ahead of time. I ordered the papaya salad pumpkin curry and basil noodle stir fry. I thought the pumpkin curry was simply okay but the other two were really good. Good Google find around Time Square for Thai.' u"Great cocktails and the thai food is sooo good! I'm pretty surprised on how low the rating is for Qi. Definfelty more than 3 stars forsure. I ordered Pad See Yew and asked to make it mild spice and it was perfectly cooked. One of the best thai places I tried in NY. When I come back to NY I will definitley come back here again. Not just the food was on point but the environment setting is great!" u'The ambience is awesome the waitress was very pleasant and the tasty food came in time..' u"So my plans were to check out Urbo & was \xa0surprised to see they are no longer in business. \xa0Decided to try this place a few blocks away which I've passed by many times before & was always captivated by the decor inside. \xa0Upon entering we were greeted quickly yet the staff seemed a bit slow nevertheless we were provided with the menu ordered a pitcher of litchi sangria (was very yummy) & then ordered from their Thai restaurant week menu consisting of a 3-course meal for a great deal. The food was \xa0diverse tasty & the flavors/spices were well balanced. I was glad to give them a try & get a closer look at the beautiful decor inside."]
114.Num Pang Sandwich Shop,[u". I got the chicken chimchurri sandwich \xa0with the cool yogurt sauce . The bread was garlicy which overpowered the chicken's flavor but overall probably one of the best sandwiches in the area. A little heavy for \xa0a hot day. Not a bad line. But they always seem to be out of tap water.I want to come back and try the chicken chimi churri rice bowl it looked delicious with the vegetables and sauce" u"2 stars for really fast service and almost good flavors.I got a Chicken Rice Bowl - $12. It's supposed to have rice veggies chicken some sauces. Generally healthy lunch.It is mainly rice. Decent amount of chicken. Hardly ANY vegetables. I had a couple of onion pieces some green beans? (I think) and 2 pieces of zucchini. Oh and don't forget the 4 large pieces of raw carrots.... also the rice had oil under it. Where did that even come from?Needless to say I did not eat much of my food. I feel like I wasted my money and I won't be back. Sorry Num Pang." u'Great fast-casual concept. \xa0Popped in here recently before a Broadway show with my wife and daughter for a quick bite. \xa0We sampled a few items together...a sandwich and a couple of bowls.The five spice glazed pork belly sandwich was similar to a Banh mi with fresh vegetables and a little kick in the sauce. \xa0It was delicious! \xa0Next was the skirt steak noodle bowl which was served with cold vermicelli noodles lettuce a protein and various spices. \xa0Both my wife and daughter really loved this concoction. \xa0But in my opinion the best dish of the three was the roasted chicken rice bowl made with brown rice veggies chili yogurt and chive lime vinaigrette. \xa0The blending of flavors in this meal was really excellent and unusual.I would definitely come back here again to one of the many locations around the city.' u'This was my second time coming to this chain though 1st time to this location. I came during lunch hour so it was very packed but food delivery was relatively quick (still had to wait about 5-10 minutes for my sandwich after order). Lots of seating here which is really nice. But why are the sandwiches so expensive?? At least they are tasty.' u'My friend and I were in Times Square when she got a craving for sandwiches but didn\'t want to feel like she went all the way to the city for Subway sandwiches so I found this spot on Yelp. It\'s a block away from Times Square between 6th and 7th but there was no one there when we arrived so that was pretty surprising. I ordered the Ginger Barbecue Brisket Sandwich which was served with cucumber pickled carrots and red cabbage cilantro and chili mayo on a quinoa baguette ($9.75). SO GOOD! My sandwich was packed with flavor the brisket was super tender and the chili mayo added the perfect kick to my sandwich. Sandwiches here are the perfect size too - they\'re not too small that I felt like I was being ripped off but they\'re not big enough for me to feel like I\'m in a food coma. I just left feeling satisfied.My friend ordered the Pulled Duroc Pork Sandwich which came with the same additions as mine except they use spiced honey instead of picked red cabbage ($8.95). She really enjoyed it.There\'s plenty of seating and a water dispenser in the middle of the room which is really convenient.I wouldn\'t really categorize this as Cambodian food but their website claims that it\'s "Cambodian-inspired". Regardless of what type of cuisine this falls under I loved my sandwich and I\'d definitely return!' u'I am so disappointed in myself I could have swore that I reviewed this establishment... Oh well better late than never.I love this little place (infinity times better than the place by grand central). I am not quite sure about the other items on their menu but their sandwiches are ALWAYS A DELIGHT-- I crave of them even in my dreams.So let\'s talk sandwich and I\'ll be real I don\'t know what authentic Cambodian sandwiches are but they remind me of Vietnamese sandwiches with a more refined appearance and maybe an extra hit or two of flavor. This location in particular (and being that it has franchises I guess I was wrong to have expected consistent quality but the shop by Grand Central was really disappointing) has a nice relaxing "chill" atmosphere along with great sandwich presentation. What do I mean by sandwich presentation? I\'m talking about perfectly toasted bread (with that hinnnnt of garlic oh yeah baby) firmly surrounding its contents-- none of that soggy whole bread is fallin\' apart kinda thing (I wouldn\'t have even mentioned this had I not known it was possible).And it tastes like Heaven in yo mouth! Thus far I have tried their pulled pork and their pork belly-- both are delicious beyond words-- I would say the pulled pork has well rounded flavor and the pork belly is like BAM BAM BAM flavor (slightly spicy). And yes there is a small slice of pear in the sandwich (and I liked it!).Anywho. I love this sandwich long time and I will expect myself back again ;) I recently noticed the location downtown so I think I will be testing that place later.' u'Hipster vibe but this Cambodian joint is like the Pol Pot version of Seinfeld soup nazi. Tried to order food with no chili sauce and was told company policy forbids it. B.s.' u'I think I ordered the wrong thing last time. I decided to give it another chance and got the noodle bowl (coconut tiger shrimp) instead and it was delicious.I recommend getting the noodle bowl and not the sandwiches.' u"Funny how I had never heard of this place before (which makes sense since it is in NY and I am in FL) but the week after I try it I read an article about how it is one of the 5 or 10 up and coming sandwich shops to look out for. \xa0I'm giving it 3 stars because mine was just A-OK but I did like it. \xa0I don't think I ordered the best one though and probably should have gone a different direction. \xa0Still if they expanded and came to FL or some other place I was travelling I would probably give it another shot.Think of it like a Bahn Mi Jimmy Johns meats Chipotle only its the Cambodian version of a Bahn Mi...or since I am sure I just insulted 2 cultures there its a Cambodian sandwich that is reminiscent of a Bahn Mi...or perhaps a Bahn Mi is reminiscent of this Cambodian sandwich. \xa0There I think I covered all scenariosThey have noodle and rice bowls and salads as well but the sandwiches are served with cucumber pickled carrots cilantro and chili mayo on a semolina or quinoa baguette baked fresh daily proving once again I know hot to copy and paste from a menu. \xa0I decided on the ginger BBQ brisket which tells you all you need to know about these sandwiches which is they are not authentic. \xa0I highly doubt you can get a ginger BBQ brisket sandwich in Cambodia. \xa0Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think so. \xa0Anyway the sandwich was good but the ginger BBQ and the brisket just didn't go well with the chili mayo. \xa0My girlfriend's spicy tofu was better and I think the pulled pork chicken or pork belly would have been better. \xa0Unfortunately though the brisket missed the mark.This is a great place because it can serve anyone - vegetarian? \xa0They have cauliflower and tofu and when we were there a portabello mushroom special. \xa0Pescatarian? \xa0Shrimp and catfish options. \xa0Meat eater? \xa0Everything else. \xa0That said they will not modify or substitute their sandwiches so if you're a picky eater then this isn't the place for you.I may not have had the best experience but I still liked it and would like to give it another shot. \xa0Hope they're successful and I hope someone who can make a mean Bahn Mi follows their example and opens a similar shop." u'I decided to try Num Pang while I waited for the chance to do Angkor Cambodian Bistro not that they are on the same level but you got to take those baby step first if you never had Cambodian right?There are a few Num Pang sandwich shops in Manhattan I just pick this one because it was closer and I went. \xa0The place is small the order and pick-up counter is about 20 feet from the entrance and the store is about 20 feet wide. You have a few rows of stand up counters to eat your food but I would say the majority of customers do take out.When you walk in you can see a large menu above the order / pick-up counter. \xa0With sandwiches sides soup salads rice & noodle bowls beverages including beer. The place looked crowed but I was in and out in 5 minutes.I was tempted to try the Grilled Corn on the Cob but I still have bad memories with the Mexican Corn I had before were earned the title of Messy Boy for months. \xa0I played it safe and went for the popular Five-Spice Glazed Pork Belly sandwich. \xa0The sandwich was $9:25 but they are small like dainty size like five inches long I can see how customers would need to get two.The sandwich has non-greasy pork pickled cucumber carrots and spicy chili mayo on Quinoa bread and was yummy and had a light spice flavor to it. I really liked it and plan to go back and try some of the other items except the corn.' u"Sandwiches were good but not as flavorful as other Cambodian sandwich shops. I love cilantro and this sandwich was packed with it but unfortunately the meat was not up to par. As a side note after eating the sandwich my stomach did not feel the best and later that night I had extreme stomach pains and fell ill. I'm wondering if the meat in my sandwich was not good. Needless to say when we return to NYC we will probably not come back due to the illness." u"A little disappointed with the pork belly sandwich. The menu above the register did not specify it comes with pickled pear and I definitely did not enjoy the texture of it in the middle of my sandwich. I also paid extra for more chili mayo but still ended up feeling like there was a lot of bread and less filling. I'd be willing to come back for the pork sandwich or rice bowls as they looked interesting." u"I am not a huge fan of sandwiches in general but the ones from Num Pang are to die for! My favorite is the Coconut Tiger Shrimp. Shrimp is not a typical ingredient in a sandwich (people naturally think of turkey chicken meatballs or other types of protein in between buns) but Num Pang makes it work - and oh so deliciously I might add!All the Num Pang classic sandwiches are served with cucumber pickled carrots cilantro and its signature chili mayo (I think it's a mix of sriracha and mayonnaise) on a freshly toasted semolina flour baguette which is baked fresh daily. The shrimp is covered in toasted coconut flakes that add an interesting balance of crunchy texture and sweet flavor. For those of you who are carb-conscious I'd encourage you to just go all out and indulge in Num Pang because the baguette is so delicious. You don't want to miss even a bite of it.In addition to sandwiches Num Pang also has rice bowls and salad. I like the Roasted Chicken Rice Bowl. You get a choice of brown or jasmine rice with marinated chicken thighs and grilled vegetables topped with chili yogurt and chive lime vinaigrette. It's a pretty big portion. I've also gotten the Grilled Skirt Steak Salad...you will probably want to stick with the rice bowl or sandwiches here because the salad was a bit disappointing and pricey for what you get The steak was way overcooked and consequently dry. Under the steak is basically just plain romaine cabbage bell peppers and sprouts with house dressing (it tasted like fish sauce). Nothing too special." u'I ordered the spicy pork rice bowl and the chicken rice soup. The rice bowl had good flavor but the grilled carrots were still really raw. The pork wad tender though. The chicken rice soup was nothing special. That night I had some bad stomach problems though.' u"Go for the sandwiches. Dont bother with the other menu items. They're similar in style to bahn mi. Lots of flavors in the different types of sandwiches. My favorite is the pork belly. The catfish is also quite good. Pulled pork brisket and skirt steak sandwiches are also pretty good. My only complaint is that it's not a very big sandwich so if I'm really hungry I may not feel completely full after one. But two is too much.It's near Time Square but hasnt become inundated with tourists. Still I dont go too often as I hate having to fight my way through the tourist crowds (on the streets not in the restaurant)." u"Eh. They're Cambodian sandwiches nothing close to Banh Mi the Vietnamese version. The menu is definitely more americanized with options such as steak and pulled pork. I opted for the pulled pork sandwich and though I stayed in and ate it right away upon grabbing the sandwich the bottom half was soggy and wet. The meat was tender and the spicy mayo was a nice touch. It's extremely pricey for what it is. The size of the sandwich does not account for the price. For just the sandwich alone it was almost $10 with tax. It's a nice spot for lunch breaks with bar-like seating; though I arrived at around 1:30PM peak lunch hours there was still plenty of seating." u"We went at an off peak time (2PM) so there wasn't much of a wait and there was plenty of seating available. The shop is a little too dark for my liking but it definitely gives off a hole-in-the-wall hipster vibe.I ordered the Five Spice Pork Belly Sandwich and a Blood Orange Lemonade. I thought the lemonade would be freshly squeezed so I was a little disappointed to find that it was just a regular ol' bottled drink. I would definitely recommend the pork belly sandwich though! It's pretty much a banhmi with pork belly and a dash of spicy mayo. I was famished and I thought the sandwich was plenty of food to fuel me up for the rest of the afternoon!" u'Had a 6 hour layover at JFK on my way to Iceland so we stopped through Time Square for lunch. I dragged my hubby here and the place was pretty empty.While I thought the sandwiches were tasty I think the stand out is the crunchiness of the bread. It is a big improvement to the typical French baguette used in bahn-mis.' u'Update: recently tried the peppered catfish on quinoa. While the fish was a little overcooked and then missed my swap of chili soy instead of mayo (again) it was still delicious and pleasantly tangy. Quinoa bread is always a plus.' u'Solid sandwich shop for fresh Southeast Asian fusion sandwiches reminiscent of a Vietnamese Banh Mi for those who would like a comparison. Tried both the pulled pork and ginger brisket. Great flavor fresh slaw and a crisp warm baguette rounded out the experience. A touch on the pricey side for the size only reason for the 4 star rating.']
147.Blockheads,[u'We came here after bar hopping and it was my desperate need for a bathroom that made us stop here spontaneously. I had very little expectations since it was in a courtyard and I thought it would be a generic place. However I was very pleasantly surprised. They gave us a generous bowl of chips and a salsa. The chips were the hard type not the thin Tostitos type that breaks apart when dipping. The salsa was also packed with flavor it was super garlicky. We ordered the taco dish to share. It came with 2 decent sized tacos that had a layer of soft taco and hars taco. I was surprised they had a choice of hard and soft tacos. \xa0I love hard taco shells and they rarely offer them in restaurants. The 2 tacos came with rice and beans guacamole and sour cream ($12.95). They had a lot of choices but there was an add on price ($2-3) for the high end meat like steak.We got the 2 meat tacos that were basic price.Beef picadigallo- the ground beef was so tender and flavorful not dry at all!Grill chicken- the chicken was also packed with flavor. It was super juicy and tender it seemed to be rotisserie I stead of grilled.The rice and beans were also super flavorful. The rice was perfectly cooked and the beans had a nice smoky bacon flavor.The only thing disappointing was the guacamole which needed more flavoring either more spice garlic or onions.' u'Ehh. If you\'re low on money and want something edible you can stop by. "Mexican" food--decent drinks. I had to send my food back twice...' u"The best part was drinking a frozen margarita in their outdoor space. The margaritas are such a deal - $5 for a plain +$1 for a flavor (I did peach). As most have said they are strong..so extra kudos. The service was average. Once we sat we got the chips and salsa immediately. However it look a little long to get our drinks...and to get refills of our drinks. The food was good too. I got the tomatillo chicken burrito (mini size) with a side salad. I asked for it black beans and spanish rice. The beans were good but I thought the spanish rice was a little bit dry. The portion was generous! I had my burrito around 6pm and I was full until I went to sleep around 3am. But overall I think it's a nice quick meal when the weather is nice. :)" u"Service was quick but that's because i went in a Saturday at 3:30 pm. The food was not that flavorful and the frozen margaritas are weaker than motherburger." u"Love this place for a quick and inexpensive lunch in midtown where you can actually sit down. The wait staff is also friendly and will quickly get you anything you need or correct any errors. And the food is great too! Always have good margarita specials too. Can't recommend this place enough!" u'Blockheads is a really fun concept great margaritas served in an all outdoor setting. The place is usually very packed so the wait is long. For the most part the staff is attentive and friendly. However the food is bland and sometimes a bit cold. But the margaritas are to die for.' u"Very slow service and older gentleman (maybe the owner) had to tell the staff repeatedly to serve us waited about 25 mins after a server came to take an order again very slow  don't recommend" u'Food and drinks were surprisingly very good. I had two tacos. One beef picadillo and one steak chimichurri. Both were very good. I also had their margarita and it was awesome. Place was very small and it was crowded but I definitely recommend it.' u'I\'m pretty sure almost everyone has heard or been to a Blockheads. They have 6 main locations all over the city. They\'re well-known for their killer drink specials... their Margaritas are hella strong so if you\'re like me one or two will most certainly do the trick. It\'s a great fun lively environment for happy hour or dinner. I find myself coming here with my co-workers or with friends out-of-town. As I said their ritas\' are delicious and heavy handed. My personal favorite is on the rocks but their frozen are done well. And if you like that extra flavor you can add that for additional $. Food wise not bad. I\'ve tried a bunch of menu items from their Burritos to their Quesadillas. All pretty good. Burritos are HUGE and if you want to go the "healthier" route you can make it into a salad or ask for a smaller tortilla. For all my vegan and vegetarian friends they can cater to your needs no problemo. During the warmer weather (if that ever comes) they have outdoor seating which is really nice during the summer months. We went on a particularly mild day and they said the wait would be 30-45 minutes if we wanted to sit inside. However they were very strict in letting us know that if we sat and had a drink outside we couldn\'t go inside. Choose one or the other. Doesn\'t matter if it was only for a rita or two. Oh well.' u"Well Well well we meet again Blockheads. I couldn't resist the chicken wrap now you think you can control?!! hmm I don't have a chicken wrap problem!!! I came here and yes had to get the wrap again it's the best one I've had throughout the city aside with the 2 regular sized $5 margaritas and king sized $8. Let's say it was pleasant meal It's always strange that it's before class too but w/e the mvp however for the night was the chips. Yes the complimentary chips was what stood out. It was great a tortilla chip to perfection. That by the end of the night we (my friend) had 3 chip bowl refills. Now im starting to get hungry writing this lol" u"Needed to kill some time before a ticket lottery so we stopped for a couple margaritas. Can't speak on the food other than the free chips and salsa but wow are their drinks strong. $5 for a frozen marg two or three and you'll be feeling good. Outdoor seating went around 4 on a Friday and only had to wait about 10-15 minutes but if you're just looking for food no alcohol they have public tables you can sit at and go inside to order yourself. Service was great our waiter checked in on us plenty. A bird crapped on my phone while there but I won't hold that against them." u"We came in were seated immediately and were given our menus. It was lunch time so they had pretty good lunch specials for food and drinks.I went just to try it out for the first time so I didn't out do myself  I ordered a half pink lemonade/half margarita it has a specific name but I can't remember! It was pretty good but not strong enough for me. As an appetizer we had chips and guacamole with the complimentary salsa which was VERY good. I then ordered a chicken quesadilla as an entree and it was surprisingly good!! I wasn't expecting for it to be that good honestly I thought this place was more about the drinks but I certainly love the food better then the drinks.Our waiter was nice nothing out of the ordinary." u'I was really impressed by this little place! My friend brought me here for dinner before we went to a show on a Friday night. It was super busy (we waited about 20-30 min for a table). The inside seemed a little dark but there was plenty of outdoor seating. Had one drink with the chips and salsa they brought us which was pretty strong and tasty. My friend and I both had burritos (mine was whole wheat tortilla chicken black beans rice etc.). It was so good! It was definitely big but it was tasty enough that I would have eaten the whole thing if I could!The service was good not great but good. Some things were really quick others took a while. I would definitely make a stop here on my next trip to NYC :)' u'Just tried it for the first time this past weekend. I\'m usually not a fan of "gringo-fied" ethnic food places. But this pseudo-Mexican joint gets all my applause. They are LIT.First off this location is located in a sort-of plaza a huge courtyard if you will. The restaurant part of it is a borderline kiosk with very little seating inside and the focal point of this location being the outdoor seating and the abundance of it at that. That\'s the first brownie point right there. Next we get seated and are immediately graced with some de-freakin-licious nachos that are smaller than most nachos at other places. They\'re NORMAL-sized so you can actually stuff a whole one in your mouth. And the salsa & guac that come with them? Totally amazeballs. Very frickin\' LIT.So we proceeded to order drinks... I\'m a frozen drink kinda guy. After looking at the drink menu I decide to try the "Bandera De Mexico". (If you\'ve never taken Spanish class for longer than a marking period that means Mexican Flag). It was a 3-layer drink that represented the colors of the Mexican Flag with each layer having a completely different taste but working well together. I drank about 3 or 4. My friends had Cuervo Dogs. Some frozen concoction with a beer turned down into it. The drinks were LIT and therefore I was Lit.Then out came the food. They do pretty good Mexican fare. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Quesadilla to play it safe.... Oh. My. Goodness... Just heavenly. It was juicy cheesy and flavorful on a tortilla that had nice bite to it on the exterior but still maintained a pleasant softness. Food was LIT.Oh yeah... The prices? Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit. Overall? This joint is LIT. Super lit. Uber lit. Highly lit. Superbly lit. Extremely lit... LIT LIT LIT LIT... OMFG it\'s lit.' u'I was going to initially just "let it be" with this place...under the "if you\'ve got nothing nice to say..." rule...but my conscience has gotten the better of me. This place was a big miss. Limited drink selection amateur margaritas and stale tortilla chips (even the refills). Can\'t blame the server I believe he did the best with what the place had to offer (unless it was his flub that the guacamole order came w/out chips like the almost finished ones that came w/ the previous salsa order were enough). I don\'t know if this place used to be better but I don\'t think even Jon Taffer would waste his time with it as of late. This biz would have to be gutted to the studs and rebuilt soup to nuts. Unique outside courtyard seating set-up seems to be the only draw to this place from what I can gather (hence the second star). If I can help save the evening of one innocent couple my duty is done. NYC has SO much more to offer for your hard earned dollars.' u"I've either heard come here or don't come here. Well the cheap margaritas told me to come here. Got here around 3ish on a Saturday. Place was pretty empty and got seated right away. Chips and salsa were brought to the table and my friend and I looked over the menu.They have lunch specials for around $11 + change that come with either a soda or lunch size margarita. Went for the Mexican chicken wrap grilled chicken corn lettuce guac sour cream Jack cheese. You can either get a side salad or rice and beans I got the rice and beans. I also got the lunch size margarita. Wrap came grilled and was very tasty. Ingredients stayed completely in the wrap while eating tortilla wasn't too large and the cheese was perfectly melted. Rice and beans were also a good side for the wrap. Lunch size margarita is smallish but overall it was a nice size for lunch the margarita itself was great. Perfect balance of booze and the ice was blended perfectly smooth (probably because they are spun in a smoothie machine the whole time). I also got the limited edition Star Wars marg ($6) which had blue Cura\xe7ao peach snapps and I think cranberry (I could be wrong) it was pretty good but tasted pretty much like a plain margarita.Service was nice and prompt the restaurant itself is pretty small but it was cozy on a cold day. They also have whole wheat tortillas as an option. $24 for lunch with lunch size marg and a regular size marg including tip is great in my eyes. I will definitely be back." u'Great food service & driiiiiinkssssss' u'Best frozen margaritas ever! Love strawberry flavour.Today I was in hurry and had a great waiter Andre! Super attentive very sweet.Had steak burrito and service was super quick. Bottomline love blockheads!' u'I ordered the beef tacos and rice and beans. The food was decent but there are much better tacos at other restaurants. The space was very small. It was definitely a process trying to make my way in and out of this place. There is a huge area outside that is probably fun to hang out in during the summer. I could see it being a popular happy hour spot when the weather permits. I would go back if I was craving Mexican food made to order quickly.' u'Hard to beat $3 frozen margaritas ($5 for grande!) and comfort food style mexican.']
30.Times Square Diner,[u"Came here because it was one of the closest 24/7 diners close to my hotel I was really impressed with their buffalo wings I am a very big critic when it comes to wings lol I like to have my own personal ratings in my head but thanks to yelp \xa0I can bring it to life and tell ya'll haWings definitely here is a 9/10 for real!" u'Love this place. This food was so amazing!!!! Get the chicken wings. The Buffalo and pepper are so good. Service is good. But honestly the food is great!!!! Go for the food.' u"Traditional reliable and good food. Got a grilled spinach chicken salad and it was very good! I would recommend it to anyone for some breaky lunch or a late night.Waiters and service is friendly and happy.Dinner is a little pricey but you can't beat the location!" u"Nice little surprise off of Times Square. Clean kind of eighties motif with a friendly attentive staff. They have a full bar and espresso machine as well as an egg creme set up. If your visiting from out of town you'll do well with tap water. NYC has the best tap water in the world.We ordered a grilled cheese and their Crispy Chicken Sandwich. The grilled cheese was good. The chicken sandwich was a serious two-handed sandwich with arugula avocado cheese bacon and chipotle aioli. Their fries are hand cut and are as good as they are plentiful. The plates we saw going to other tables all looked to be good sized servings.We would definitely return" u"I don't know what it is about this place that made me uneasy. It's kinda soulless. But saying that the service was ridiculously fast. The food was pretty good (corned beef hash and eggs - eggs were cooked perfectly). The price was cheap. The portion size was plentiful. I think that this place is 24/7 just makes it seem like a conveyer belt. I was asked 3 times in the space of sitting down for 5 minutes whether I was ready to order yet. It all just felt rushed. Which is awesome if you're short on time and need a solid hearty meal.If you want a relaxed chilled brunch with atmosphere this is not the place for you." u'Late night meal and it was very good. I had the braised short rib with spinach and mashed potatoes. My son had matza ball soup and fried meatballs. Everything was excellent. Good service too.' u'Terrific food. Comfortable atmosphere. Been a few times! Try the salmon salad- very fresh.' u'Stop by here every time I am in the area! Passing from Philadelphia to Connecticut and had to detour to come get some great food!!' u'New York-minute review 2 of 5:Had the "L.E.O." (lox eggs and onions) omelette w/ home fries and toast for $14.95. \xa0Tasty. \xa0Home fries attend well.NYC water doesn\'t. \xa0Order juice or coffee.Service friendly enough. \xa0Efficient.I\'d eat here again.' u'Let\'s say hypothetically you find yourself at the 3am showing of Star Wars and need something to do between 5:30 and going to work the next day. You scour Yelp looking for a place that will be open for breakfast and Times Square Diner and Grill is the only diner that\'s reasonably convenient to get to open 24/7 and with a decent Yelp review. So you go there. Hypothetically.Ignoring the fact that it\'s incredibly depressing to go to a 24 hour diner in NYC at 6am I\'m glad it was an option. Sometimes you need greasy food and crappy coffee to fill you up before you go about your day.I had their "Loaded Times Square Breakfast" which had French toast (or pancakes) eggs bacon sausage and ham. All for $15. For where it\'s located this place is very reasonably priced. The bacon was kind of lame and soggy. When I passed by their kitchen I saw a big pile of bacon on the side of the grill so that explains it. Everything else was fine though. They only had their breakfast menu available (so no sandwiches or anything) but can\'t fault them for that.Service was fine though it took a while to get our check even with only 3 tables occupied. I hope for my sake I won\'t be returning. But not because the restaurant was bad but because I don\'t want any circumstances that necessitate going to a 24-hour diner in Manhattan.' u'Came here super hungry excited to eat an Omelette. We got seated right away. It\'s small inside typical restaurant size in NY. Our waitress was not so friendly she was quite rude actually. She took our order and delivered our food and we didn\'t see her for the rest of our meal not even to ask how things were or to check if we needed water. POOR service. But the other waiter picked up her lack of service or non there of. Food was very mediocre and lacked quality & taste. I ordered the Western Omelette it came with a side of "hash browns" and toast. All lacked flavor. I found myself adding salt constantly. If you want poor service and poor quality food that have no taste then this place is for you.' u"Get the corned beef and hash with fried eggs over easy. Theirs is the best I have ever had. What's more the service is stellar. Edgar took great care of us. Steven does a great job running this place; everyone is smiling and genuinely happy. This will be our regular stop for breakfast on these NYC trips." u'All the food is unique. \xa0Not out of a box and very flavorful for a fast order restaurant. \xa0Food is such and reasonably priced. \xa0Have fun' u'Would have got 5 stars but took 15 minutes to get check and asking several times. Plus never got checked on after food was delivered. Food was great cost was reasonable and service up until food came was friendly and awesome.' u'This is my first review in NYC and felt that this place has lot more to offer than what meets the eye on the first visit.Nice cozy ambiance. Good choices in menu. I had a 8 oz. BBQ Burger with fries and my colleague had a crispy fried chicken sandwich. Both were awesome in taste and the burger quality was really really heavy- I could not finish it off fully.The bill for two with tips came at $34 which is good as per Times Square standards.Overall a nice place for quick bites.' u"I've been here twice late at night. It was great to get away from the madness of Times Square and actually have some decently tasting priced diner food. \xa0Both times I had breakfast food and it was good!" u'My friends and I decided to come here for a quick bite to eat after a night out. It was one of the few places open at 4:30 in the morning that would host a rowdy party of 7 at "affordable" prices. Upon entering the diner we were greeted with a nice server who immediately sat us down and combined 2 tables together for us because there was only a booth available for 4 to begin with. The waitress was patient and courteous dispute the fact that we were loud and rowdy. So a big plus for that lol. I settled for the Times Square burger made medium rare. When it arrived I was overwhelmed by the amount of grease that dripped off the burger and finishing it was such a messy task. The mushrooms however went well with the burger. I just don\'t think it was worth the $9 though for just the burger. At least throw in some fries and the option of lettuce and tomatoes for that price. (Fries and other condiments costed extra). We also ordered the Times Square platter to split amongst ourselves and that my friend was a huge disappointment. At $14 you got mozzarella sticks that were extremely hard and dry chicken tenders that were boarder line burnt and salty and "spicy" buffalo wings that were salty (not spicy) enough to make your tongue lose feeling. I\'m not a big fan of wasting food but the platter was so bad that I didn\'t even bother finishing it. \xa0Overall the service here was great but the food was a big no. The kitchen staff also could\'ve done a better job cleaning the eating utensils as there were dishwasher stains on the forks that we were using. Would I be back in the future? Probably not.' u"I had the Greek salad- which was delicious!The menu was diverse with very reasonable prices for NYC! The service staff was friendly and attentive! And you can't beat this location- right across the street from our hotel! A great place to bring the family! And the service was quick yet we didn't feel rushed! They serve Breakfast lunch and dinner." u"After a night of walking around Times Square and being given terrible directions about where to find good late-night restaurants in the area I found myself in Hell's Kitchen around midnight feeling very hungry. I see Times Square Diner & Grill's green neon sign above me and think that breakfast for dinner sounds pretty good and step inside.The decor here is so great. It's a total throwback vintage diner but with a modern feel. It avoids the cheesiness that themed restaurants often fall victim to and feels more like a successful renovation of an old home that paid careful attention to historical details while injecting some contemporary touches. Our waiter was super nice and attentive and service was very fast. I ordered the breakfast that came with two eggs bacon toast and potatoes and I got a side of French toast. Everything here is so affordable - my breakfast plate was less than $10 a side of French toast was only a few bucks and came with four slices of thick toast and the portions were large. Everything was delicious especially that French toast but I wasn't a fan of the potatoes sadly. They had a strange flavor that I couldn't pinpoint. I devoured everything else. So happy I found this 24-hour option because I would've had to have walked all the way back to Times Square and figured out where I was going to eat instead. Glad I got to take a walk to Hell's Kitchen instead and it was worth the trip on foot." u'The food came out very fast. \xa0The arrive was slow. \xa0They brought water right away to the table but had to wait 5-10 mins before anyone came to take order but once order was placed there was no issue. \xa0All in all food was really good but needs to step it up in the service area.']
7.Pure Thai Cookhouse,[u'Pure Thai cookhouse is pure gem in midtown West Amazing Thai and Vietnamese specialties reasonably priced. Small slip of a space on 9th Ave run mainly by women. Great vibe inside and long lines of locals out the door says it all! Not to be missed!' u'Tiny little shop but full of flavors! We were trying to explore places to eat around our neighborhood and came across this place. Though I\'m not sure if this is the most "authentic" Thai food I\'ve ever had we still had a great meal here. P/S their service is really good!' u"I've never been to Thailand so I cannot speak to its authenticity. but this food is damn good. First off you will feel transformed out of Hell's Kitchen because there definitely is a jungle-esque vibe to this place. From the tin roof to the walls etc.Service was amazing. The food came out in under 10 minutes my water cup never went past half empty and they were just all extremely nice and gracious in there.Now the food... Their food is not greasy at all and the ingredients were all very fresh - from the noodles to the meat to the vegetables. I highly recommend the pad se ew. Some people may say that it's a bit bland but they encourage you to add heat and other sauces that are provided or that can be ordered. This worked out perfectly because everyone can have their version of the same dish to their liking. Most everything was $14 but 2 dishes per person is more than enough food." u"I came in with a friend around 5:15 pm on a Monday- no wait not too crowded. Perfect.First off I ordered the special appetizer which had quail eggs and chicken mince fried in a wonton wrapper. 6 quail eggs for $10 and literally 2/6 actually had chicken mince the rest were naked eggs. Good taste but a bad start over all.My friend ordered pad thai - he really enjoyed it but from my perspective something was wrong. The noodles were far too wet. Even before he added the hot sauce I could see that the noodles were visibly saucy. I ordered the pad see ew - there was a decent little bowl of soup at the bottom of it. The problem is pad see ew is also completely dry and should be stirfried! And as the Cantonese would say there was no wok hei (breath of wok) here. The noodles were tender and fresh but it just wasn't right. The beef was tasty but to cut back on Chinese broccoli costs they gave me regular broccoli and ... cauliflower?! I kid you not. This was $14 as well.Overall despite the very kind service and authentic Thai feel to the place the food was good but over-priced and not well executed." u"After a quick search I found this place to be close to where I was going that night. No reservation needed although it was quite busy that night for dinner. The place is a bit small but it was pretty lively and the restaurant was a bit hidden compared to others around it.The food was great! Everything came out fresh and very flavorful. The staff was very friendly and was quick and attentive to my needs even if they weren't serving you. I would definitely come back here again but maybe keep it to 2-4 people max. Not sure if you can fit a whole party in there." u"Mos def on of the better Thai spots on 9th Ave. If you've spent anytime over here in Hell's Kitchen then you know there are a copious amount of choices for Thai. However I would say this is one you don't want to pass up.Being lucky enough to have traveled to Thailand and even luckier to have a number of Thai friends I've had my fair share of authentic Thai food and this gets damn close.Green papaya salad is generally my litmus test for a Thai spot... shortly after the mango sticky rice more on that later. Since I was dining with someone who is not as spice tolerant as I we got a notch below Thai spicy and it was delicious. The papaya was fresh the spices added depth and the texture was great. When then proceeded to get the Pad See Ew and Wok Basil w/ Chicken. Both were great dishes and I would get them again... if I wasn't so in to trying new things!Finally the atmosphere was great your typical long narrow venue you find in HK; The staff were super friendly of course; and everything was very clean and orderly." u"Worth the wait. Wonderful service. Food came relatively quickly after being seated. So many incredibly friendly servers. They were attentive to the perfect level. My water was never ever empty which is rarely the case anywhere. It's a small space but I was impressed with how they used it- we didn't feel cramped at all despite being seated at a shared table towards the back.Food was delicious. Ordered the steamed vegetable dumplings (try them at least once) the steamed beef buns pad see ew with beef made spicier and the jungle curry fried rice. High quality food at reasonable prices. Next time looking to try the crab/pork dry noodles that everyone's raving about and wok basil with chicken. Not in this area a whole lot but Pure Thai Cookhouse is sure to change that." u"Wow! Really impressed with this little thai restaurant. We came on a Sunday night at 8pm and it was packed!! The wait was 1.5hrs so we decided to get it to go and eat at home. Not a bad idea! (The food only took 15min to prepare).The pork and egg crab noodle was a really nice dish to start with especially if you pour in the sauce it comes with so it gives it that little sour taste. Really opens up your appetite. The curry puffs were surprisingly yummy! I was expecting it to be super dry and since its take out for the puff part to not be very good anymore. But the puff was holding up really well! Very fluffy and not dry at all. The crab fried rice was amazing! (We ended up having some left over and I heated it up in the microwave the next morning and still tasted superb). I'd recommend adding some chili flakes they give you and some lemon if you like it slightly sour. The chicken wings were also good but not mind blowing so next time I would skip this one and try something else. Affordable and authentic thai." u"I guess I will have to appreciate the fact that I live in Hell's Kitchen that I could pick up from Pure Thai when the waiting time on an early Tuesday night is still half an hour. Surprisingly the sanity rating is only B...Went with the most popular dish Ratchaburi crab and pork dry noodle - this was served non-spicy and they kindly put spicy sauces inside. Though I did not really like the egg noodle both the pork and crab meat carried enough flavor. The pork was actually very similar to a very popular Chinese dish - cha siu. I liked my app veggie dumpling a lot. The dumplings were wrapped in the house-special crystal crust very chewy!Probably I should have ordered some spicy dishes given those were signatures - gonna try spicy beef salad chicken wings and if am dining in the Thai iced tea! Well executed!" u"Just had it the other day because of the high review. Had to say that I expected more. I had chicken puffs and crab fried rice- nothing out of the ordinary.. And I didn't see any crab meat to be honest... Price is not bad for lunch $10-12 for an entree." u"Best thai food I have had in a long time. I know everyone says places are the best this or that. Let me tell you why. This place is authentic thai cuisine. What does that mean? It means thai food that is not oily or greasy! Yes thai food is not normally oily and greasy; the problem is most places cook the food that way. I'm glad to find a place that doesn't just serve oily noodles.Next the food had the right blend of flavors. I had the pad kraw mao with chicken and the baby back rib appetizer.It was not overly spiced nor overly laced with fish sauce. The key here is balance.New when it comes to spice. The first rule of thumb is that the chef's sense of mild medium hit may be different than yours. As such I always go mild at a new place and that was perfect for me here. Maybe I will take it up a notch but mild here will be perfect for most people especially those who are really into true thai spicy.As to the baby back ribs many have reviewed them. Just order them! If you like ribs these thai style ribs will confuse and delight your palate at the same time; they are simply wonderful." u"This place is TINY really tiny. But the food is good. I had pad see ew with vermicelli and chicken. There was a lot of it and it had good flavors.We got a bottle of wine for $30 - it was good but certainly not worth $30. For a Tuesday night there was a 30+ minute wait time for a table for two. Then! They asked if we would mind sharing a table with other people.......yes...so we had to wait longer.This place is good but I would not go out of my way to go back. The tables are very close together and they had small plastic stools for seats. I don't know...not my style." u"Love this place! Literally best pad see ew I've ever had and I'm half Thai. The noodles were that kind of spongy texture which is my favorite and the sauce was delicious. The Thai coffee was super good too not as strong as Vietnamese coffee but still delicious. The overall ambiance of the place is very whole in the wall it feels like a street market setting. I loved it. The other dishes on the menu were also so mouthwatering looking. The pricing on everything was also not bad either ($10-15/dish) but they will charge you extra for rice (my friend got the shrimp and they charged her). The service was fantastic we ordered quickly and were promptly served. They're also great about splitting the check however they did mix up our cards with the dishes which I was confused about since they all had their own envelopes. Will for sure be back if I'm in the Hell's Kitchen area!" u'I have been to Pure Thai alot. I was first introduced to Pure Thai by my Thai friend. She always spoke highly of this restaurant saying that it is very authentic Thai cuisine. I was fortunate to visit Thailand last year and I agree. The food and the atmosphere was a match with some of the places I visited. I enjoy that they great you in Thai when you come in and leave. My favorite dish here is the Pa-yao Beef Noodles Soup and I normally go with the egg noodles. The food looks good tastes even better and the staff are always smiling. I am definitely going to be coming back here.' u'Super cramped and sometimes a wait but I came with only one other person which is easier to get seated. It felt authentic with the decor and sitting so close to other patrons.LOVED the food here and LOVED the service. Curry puffs were great and even though I was reluctant to try the entrees they ended up being the best of my favorites: sweet salty noodles light on the sauce.' u"Shrimp Pad Thai was good although the ratings had me expecting something more. \xa0The noodles could have been more flavorful but it may have had to do with I wanted the noodles spicy. They were spicy but I think the spice took away from the flavor. I would go back \xa0I would just get something different. I ordered to-go and by the time I got there my food was ready which was nice. It is a smaller restaurant \xa0but it's on the cozy side...not too small. I liked it. They were busy!" u'After reading about such raving reviews on Yelp I decided to check out PURE Thai Cookhouse in Hell\'s Kitchen. Their claim to fame is providing a genuine Thai shophouse-style experience that features homemade noodles from a prized family recipe. My friend and I got there at 7:30PM on a Tuesday evening and we had to wait 30 minutes before being seated at the bar.I got the Ratchaburi Crab & Pork Dry Noodles which is made with handmade egg noodles topped with roasted pork lump crab meat yu choy (Chinese greens) and scallion. The dry noodles are mixed in slightly sour and sweet sauce. It was a bit suspicious that the noodles was served less than 10 minutes from being ordered but I guess there really isn\'t much being "cooked" other than the noodles. Overall the dish was tasty but it didn\'t blow my mind. The noodles are tangy but was a bit overcooked. I liked the roasted pork especially since it was pretty lean. I wished there had been more crab meat and yu choy.We also shared the Pumpkin Custard Sticky Rice as a dessert. I\'ve had plenty of mango sticky rice but it was my first time trying the pumpkin custard version. The rice was a bit too sweet but I really liked the pumpkin flavor on top.' u"i've heard quite a bit about this place before coming here and thought it was just hype. \xa0but i'm very happy to report that i LOVE everything! \xa0i picked this place for a going-away dinner and there were 5 of us. \xa0the wait wasn't too bad actually. \xa0it took longer to wait for our party to show up than to get an actual table. \xa0lol. \xa0but once our party was complete we were quickly seated at the round table near the front. \xa0(i was secretly hoping that we'd get that table because perfect lighting!)we got the following to try:-steamed veggie dumplings: \xa0one of their signature dishes but i found the filling too sweet. \xa0however aside from the sweetness it was quite tasty.-softshell crab salad: \xa0this was a daily special and we really liked it. \xa0the salad had a tangy bright dressing and the softshell was perfectly crispy. \xa0it was very refreshing on a hot day.-ratchaburi pork and crab noodles: \xa0loved the pork lump crab meat the noodles were chewy and there was a really good sauce on the bottom of the bowl be sure to mix it up well. \xa0they also brought various sauces and condiments for you to spice up the dish. \xa0please please please proceed with caution with the chili powder they're VERY spicy. \xa0i made the mistake and went in on it (a good spoonful i might add) almost ruined my palette. \xa0lol.-mango sticky rice: \xa0yum! \xa0no complaints here.-pumpkin custard: \xa0excellent as well!-thai iced tea: \xa0perfect balance of creamy and sweet tea. \xa0usually thai teas are really sweet this one was just right.the restaurant stays busy the whole time we were there but we were well taken care of. \xa0our server was very attentive but not intrusive. \xa0the food omg the food was excellent possibly one of my favorite meals lately. \xa0i gotta find a way to go back!" u"One of the best Thai places I've eaten at in the US and the best Thai place I've eaten at on the mainland US (the other was in Maui). My friend knows the owners; they're actually Thai and the nicest people ever.This place is quite busy; it's a small location and there were people waiting even at 3pm on a rainy day. It's worth the wait though.I don't quite remember what we ordered; the owner had suggested several dishes to us that were all amazing. I strongly recommend this for authentic Thai food." u"This is one of my favorite Thai places in the city the food is fresh and very authentic tasting - it isn't oily or over spiced. Definitely more authentic then trendy as far as the taste goes. The place is pretty small and seating is tight so come alone as a couple or with a smaller party."]
198.Smokey Burger Organic,[u"I've eaten at Smokey Burger a few times and I was ready to give it 3 Stars. Let me explain..The Burgers are delicious and cooked very well. The meat is great quality and it just so happens that it's Halal. The sides are also delicious.The service however had been poor - every single time I time. I went again a couple days ago and the service had improved significantly. The wait staff was courteous and the food arrived in a timely manner. Assuming that the trend continues I would continue to go to Smokey Burger again and fully recommend that you do too!" u'Great food fair prices. \xa0I highly recommend the turkey burger on the pretzel roll.The atmosphere was nice and cozy. \xa0I will be back' u"Food is amazong! I'm s vegetarian the burgers areGreat and they have a great veggie burger l. Very fresh and of Course organic." u'i cant get the appetizers with the "Smokey Burger" I would not be able to walk to my car then. The burger alone was incredible! Great service as well. The area is tough to find parking in however so come in earlier than expected. For the halal eaters they are make sure you are aware of what is halal and not which is something to appreciate.' u"Place is pretty. The beef burger was nice and juicy. They waitress was nice she knew we were there for Iftar so she said she'd bring the food in at Iftar time." u"Smokey burger is that place you want to go if you haven't eaten for days. The restaurant is a tiny hole in the wall on a busy street near times square. It's right next to a Thai restaurant so I'm guessing that's where their drinks and appetizers are inspired from. We had the lobster fritters which were good but usual and sweet potato fries love how fresh they were! As for burgers we had the cabana deluxe and smokey burger which were both really good and well made. The burgers are big enough for 2 people to share each. Juicy tender and flavorful would go often if it wasn't so far and inconvenient for car people like me. As for muslims this place is halal and there were tons of guests enjoying proving it so! Totally need to come at least once so you can say you've had a original halal burger!" u'Good for a quick burger. \xa0Good onion rings. \xa0Friendly service. \xa0The bison burger was excellent.' u"Expensive AND terrible food...didn't think that was possible. We got wings and fries for the table which were the absolute worst. Wings were cold inside still and fries were uncooked stale blocks of starch. The burger was full of tissue clots that weren't chewable it was disgusting. I'm not sure how this place is still open. I was warned by a few friends that it wasn't good but my brother urged us to give it a chance and I regret every penny we spent." u"Great burgers. Tried the Cabana Burger which was extremely good one of the best burgers I've ever had and the onion rings. Onion rings had awesome flavor and the sauce that accompanied it was great as well. Only disappointing thing was probably the blond woman who picked up the phone when I was asking how busy the place was that night. She was extremely rude and from the reviews on Yelp I know I'm not the only one who feels that way. The Asian short woman who took our orders was awesome though. She was sweet and very pleasant. I would not mind coming back and trying something else." u'This place was recommended to us by a few of our local ( NYC/NJ) friends. Tried this place out because their burgers are made with Halal meat. ( FYI: the Bison and Elk are the only things on the menu that are NOT halal. I would double check but the waitress was kind enough to point that out to us before we ordered) I ordered their signature Smokey burger. Rather than the double patties it comes with I ordered it with just one patty well done and all the trimmings. My husband ordered it with the two patties it comes with which makes it a little bigger. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Being an organic burger joint I was not sure what to expect. But the burger with all its cheese and caramelized onions turned out to be quite tasty. Meat was well done and almost melted in my mouth. Almost felt like a well done steak patty although not too thick not too thin but just right. Yummy!Fries or other sides are not included with the burger so ordering that can add up ( especially since the fries cost $10 and can be considered a small meal of their own) Anyway a scrumptious burger and fries with a lovely chocolate ice cream shake to top it off made this place worth checking out!' u"Now this place was an absolute treat. Halal fare at its finest. I had to have the Smokey Burger with steak fries. I died and went to Jannah (not really but I like being drama). Cooked to perfection medium-rare I enjoyed every bite of this delicious burger. Extremely expensive for a gourmet burger. But it was definitely an experience. I'd love to come back and try their bison burger. My mouth is watering just thinking about it :)" u"The best burgers ever people and trust I've had burgers from all over. It feels like your eating a steak. My boyfriend and I had the mozzarella sticks coconut shrimp smokey burgers and onion rings yes we where starving. I didn't get to the onion rings but judging by the reviews I wish I had. Everything was super fresh and tasty. The burger was juicy flavorful and I wouldn't mind having it again for lunch or dinner. Sorry big daddy's but I have a new favorite \xa0you just can't beat organic. Great service! My compliments to the chef and staff! We will see you again soon. -The wizard of my wordsP.S I didn't have that full greasy guilty heavy feeling at the end. Now if that's not a five star burger then it doest exist. I expect to see Andrew Zimmerman here soon." u'Delicious burgers and great service. Nothin extraordinary but certainly worth hitting up again.' u'Went for lunch with my boyfriend. We had beef burgers root beer and fries.This place is one of my favourite \xa0now. Never have space for dessert left but definetely one day. Heard a lot about coconut bread pudding. Quick good quality reasonable price.' u"This place was AMAZING! Pretty pricey (I guess i can understand it being so close to times square) but the burgers were authentic. I ordered a burger on a brioche bun that had 2 fresh beef patties with sauteed mushrooms and onions and cheese that was melting onto the plate. It took a while to make but sooo worth the wait. I'm a burger fanatic and I know I'm eating a real burger when there's that beautiful beef juice that drips from the burger when you take a bite. Definitely coming back to treat myself :)" u'Would not revommend at allService terriblehalf the order was wrong and what we got was not so good. Did nothing to rectify the situation. \xa0Do not waste your money or time.' u"I have been waiting three months to go here. They have a grade pending sign. I finally caved in and tried the lunch deal $8.50. I had the beef burger fries and ginger ale. The burger was big with a choice of toppings. I had lettuce tomato and mayo on the side. I chose the whole grain bun that was toasted on the inside. However I found the beef patty to have a slightly sour taste. I thought they added soy sauce to it but I asked but they waitress informed me they didn't add spices. She did say they added something but I can remember what exactly it was but shouldn't have effected the flavor. I did like the large cut fries. They were soft on the inside and just lightly toasted on the outside. I think for $8.50 + tip it was an okay deal but I would be on the fence if I had to choose between a cheaper fast food burger and this place." u"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I guess you can count the one star for the the pretty wooden and brick walls they have inside. As for the food it lacked! The burgers were tasteless with absolute zero flavour. The fries were burnt and soggy with no salt. My meal completely lacked flavour. I'm never coming back here I'd rather go to Shake Shack and eat a delicious and fattening non organic burger because atleast it will have a taste to it!" u'The burger was pretty good for my millionth burger. Brioche roll was standard as I expected from a place that has "burger" in the name. My burger was cooked to perfection. I\'m taking away a couple of stars because I ordered more than just a burger and the rest of my order was given to another patron by accident. I was so into my conversation and company that I didn\'t even notice at first but near the end of the meal the waitress came over and gave us the rest of the food we originally ordered. I was done here.' u'This space is shared by One Thai Chef-they share similar staff as well. I got a beef burger and you have your choice of cheeses and sauces. I got a slice of american cheese which is $2.00 extra. The beverage choices are limited since they share the same beverages as One Thai chef. The space is narrow once again like a long hallway and the burger was good and the service prompt. I would recommend and return.']
142.Green Symphony,[u'I\'ve been a loyal fan for years i work nearby and this place has the best variety of options! I also love that it\'s literally a family owned and run cafe. Favorites include the "almond greens" smoothie that has kale and almond \xa0butter just $7 and very filling. A great variety of made to order juices (you can add in vegan protein powder flax chia etc) the made to order salads are generous and the salad bar is better than whole foods! I love their (vegan) soups in the winter and they make a great gazpacho in the summer. They also sell a great selection of healthy snacks like vegan protein bars kale chips gf crackers and delicious homemade baked goods like the oat and nuts barIt\'s popular with the broadway dancers and actors (i was in line with a few rockettes the other day). Oh- and the best part is the prices are several dollars less than elsewhere!' u"This was a good and quirky spot I even met a friend just chatting in the cafe.I love the large variety of food and healthy options and they are very well priced. I got the turkey with apple and cheese in a whole wheat wrap (it was called delicious something) as well as a ginger snap smoothie. Both were filling and hit the spot.I was extremely pleased with the price point given the location.My only issue was that the cafe eat-in area was extremely small and compact but in no way is that a deal breaker. I'm also fairly sure they didn't have air conditioning.I'll be back for sure!4/5" u"I'm obsessed with this place. They have so many amazing options that just always so good. I usually order the Temple Bowl with extra dressing but I'm convinced everything they serve here is absolutely delicious not to mention affordable. The hot/cold food bar looks delicious but I have yet to try it. I usually only order for pick up. Try the green monster if you're into green juices! I work around the corner so like I said it's my go-to for lunch pick ups! The guy working the counter is really nice but just be courteous when it's busy. There can be a line out the door during lunchtime! Best vegan/vegetarian spot in the area hands down!" u'I tried the hot food bar here today. I had the chicken enchiladas which are supposed to be made with free range chicken. Who really knows though? The food itself was good but they have limited selection. They definitely focus on more health conscious foods which is great. $10 minimum on card which is quite high.' u"Those who want to take a healthy lunch break should consider Green Symphony. A super tiny independently-owned salad bar/smoothie bar/deli that packs a great selection off their menu and buffet stations. They offer a ton of natural fruit and vegetable smoothies and drinks. If you check out their full menu they have specialty items like rice bowls (containing brown rice only) creative wraps creative salads and so forth. The options are simply great. They offer delivery and pick-up for your convenience. While they have their buffet stations I just go straight to ordering off their menu. I've tried a good share of their options which includes the Sesame Tofu Steak Salad Tofu Mania Bowl Chicken Bowl New Yorker Bowl and the Dalai Lama Bowl. Their salads range about $7-10 and I think they are pretty fair price-wise. The portions are very good and they come with plenty of the toppings that are being offered. Regarding the 'Bowls' they are simply rice bowls that come with a variety of different toppings (much like bibimbap). They strictly use brown rice for these and none of the ingredients are fried. It's my personal favorite to order when I get lunch from here if not the wraps. The smoothies and speciality mixed drinks packed with only healthy ingredients are also worth the try. They have an extensive smoothies menu that is probably the best I have encountered around here.Green Symphony is definitely one of my favorite hidden deli spots. Vegetarians/vegans would particularly love this spot because they offer so much in terms of non-meat options. Good healthy and reasonably priced food does exist in Times Square and this spot has consistently proven that on my several visits for lunch." u"This place has become a bit of an oasis for me in the Times Square desert of obscenely overpriced unhealthy crowded takeout/delivery joints. \xa0Their juices and smoothies are particular favorites - generally in the $4.50-7 range which is almost unheard of these days - they are generally excellent. I love the Almond Greens smoothie and their new Avocado Fiesta (avocado banana coconut spinach pineapple) is incredible. \xa0They make a nice fresh salad and have some great sandwich options - again for quite reasonable prices (e.g. 6.00 for tuna and avocado!).Friendly efficient service - if you drop in they will get you in and out quickly and efficiently. \xa0They have a few seats for drop-ins - it's a bit cramped but not unreasonable if you want a quick sit-down meal. \xa0They also have almost a mini-supermarket area where you can just grab a power bar or some healthy cracker/chip options (Mary's Gone Crackers etc.) so I also like to drop in a grab something if I've brought in lunch and just need a little snack of some kind. \xa0There is a hot and cold salad bar as well - my friend swears by this but healthy restaurant or no I just can't handle food that's been sitting out in trays... bad bodega memories of a lifelong New Yorker you know. \xa0Not everything is wonderful - the veggie fuel bowl was a minor disappointment - a bit dry/overcooked with a boring hard boiled egg on top - I think I was expecting too close an approximation of bibimbap - but overall I find their commitment to healthy ingredients and great service - in an area sorely lacking in both - a great relief." u'While not my favorite place for BYO salad bowls (Maoz holds that spot in my heart) Green Symphony definitely beats out similar establishments like Chop\'t or Fuel. My boyfriend and I decided to order delivery one evening since we were feeling a bit healthy. He got a standard Green Symphony salad (he lacks creativity) and I decided to create my own. Mixing and matching is the funnest part of eating healthy in my opinion.I decided to get something similar to a Chop\'t salad I had a few days before just to get a clear grasp on which establishment was better. I got a salad bowl with mixed greens grilled chicken chickpeas egg eggplant mushrooms and avocado. As well as a cucumber dressing. Portion-wise the bowl was about twice the size of the Chop\'t salad I\'d ordered. Green Symphony PACKED it with items. Considering it was less than $15 i was completely surprised by how much they\'d put in. A very hearty amount of chicken and mushrooms. The dish was totally filling and all the items were fresh I just didn\'t think it was the tastiest salad I\'ve ever had. It had a very "healthy" taste which while okay every once in a while I don\'t think I could do day after day.' u"Good reliable lunch option for healthy and filling bowls. I usually order through Seamless and the bowls held well through delivery.Opt for the Chicken Bowl a bibimbap creation with brown rice steamed vegetables and chicken. The New Yorker Bowl is quite similar to the Chicken Bowl with the addition of dumplings but I personally am not a fan of their dumplings- they are meekly stuffed and often over cooked. On the Chicken Bowl pour a generous amount of the Korean style Hot sauce (red sauce served on side) if you can handle the spice. This is what adds flavor to the bowl. I always add kimchi to add a kick of flavor and crunch as well. A couple of reservations about this dish: - Not enough veggies. When I think of bibimbap I think of plentiful mounds of veggies. The Chicken Bowl doesn't give you that and usually you're left with more rice at the end than you'd like. Would love an option to add more veggies on ordering systems such as Seamless- Chicken usually prepared too dry. Wish the chicken could be more under-cooked or kept more moist." u'It\'s about time I write a review for my favorite healthy lunch spot in Midtown. I stumbled upon Green Symphony last spring and it was love at first sight/taste. Now over a year later I\'m a faithful Yelp user and must sing the praises of this \xa0diamond in the rough....and when I say rough I\'m not exaggerating. This unassuming spot sits in the heart of Times Square which I choose to call Hell on Earth (it\'s 15 degrees hotter than the rest of the city and it houses the worst kind of people and worst kind of establishments...I rest my case). But the downsides to Green Symphony end there. This place is a perfect example of yet another overused idiom - good (GREAT) things come in small packages. Green Symphony is quite a tiny place but the vast amount of health food options they offer is overwhelming in the best kind of way. What can you get here? Anything you could ever want. They have a well-stocked buffet that\'s divided into a hot section and a cold section. As one would expect the hot section is filled with different types of chicken preparations and other various meat dishes. On the cold side (the only one I can reliably speak to) you\'ll find a nice variety of salads - a few tofu preparations (tofu curry w/ chickpeas Asian-style tofu w/ mushrooms and peas) edamame salad broccoli quinoa kale salad w/ pumpkin seeds and flax seeds etc. etc. That\'s the side I\'ve always opted for (see my picture for a visual). The food is flavorful fresh and healthy. Has yet to disappoint.If the buffet doesn\'t suit your needs on any particular day they\'ve got rice bowls salads and plenty of other options. I can speak to the Kale Salad (kale gluten-free tamari sesame oil tomato flax seeds pumpkin seeds ginger) and the Chicken Vegetable Rice Bowl (vegetables and a mildly spicy sauce. Organic brown rice free range chicken spinach bean sprouts carrots wild-root shiitake mushrooms chopped greens kimchi and egg). Both are delicious and nutritious and bring a smile to my face. I think it\'s because all of my vital organs are smiling themselves when I eat this healthfully - for with these meals they can bask in the ecstasy of knowing that their keeper cares about their lifespan.More notes:-They have smoothies/shakes aplenty. I have yet to try one but they seem to be quite the popular item here-It DOES get busy but the line moves quickly - so just be a bit patient. It\'s not a big establishment so it can seem more packed than it actually is-***PRICES!! *** I am starring this because you\'ve probably started to nod off from this novel I\'ve been writing...some of the MOST REASONABLY PRICED HEALTH FOOD I\'ve found in the city. Cheaper than Dig Inn. Cheaper than Sweetgreen. Cheaper than Fresh & Co. You get the point - this is as the Cave of Wonders utters in Aladdin and as I have repeated here a "Diamond. In. The. Rough."' u"If you're ever craving healthy food in Times Square this is your best bet. Although they have a lot of vegan/vegetarian options they aren't afraid of meat! They are also gluten free conscious if that's what you're into. Such a small space packs a punch with homemade juices and smoothies hot/cold prepared foods healthy baked goods chips snacks cookies a salad bar and two count 'em two full cases of juices and drinks ranging from Arizona iced tea to kombucha." u'Green Symphony...hmm...I like symphonies and the color green...let\'s do this! \xa0And I have never looked back. Only looking forward to my next visit ZOOM. Likes:- Quality food for a reasonable price- Most of their "homemade" ingredients are organic- Tons of organic packaged food/snacks- LOVE their bars muffins and toastsomes \xa0- An abundance of healthy options*- Vegan friendly - Not as guilty desserts**- Stellar workers***Dislikes:- Generally the hot/cold bar variety is the same or a variation of the same options- Tend to be heavy with the sauce/dressing for options at hot/cold bar *Too much of a good thing can and will affect your waistline so be ready with stretch pants. *sttrreeettcch***Not as guilty so two please. Does this make it guilty? ***The worker asked me what my favorite muffin is so he can make more for me. *heart* \xa0BUT I came in the following day and there were none...it\'s ok you\'re still cool in my book.' u"Once again my preconceived notion for this vegan place did not match my experience. Decided to grab dinner here with my vegan friend right before seeing the Book of Mormon. The menu includes non-vegan items. Since we were in a rush I didn't end up ordering vegan food mostly because I didn't wanna think too hard about what would taste good. So I ordered a Bombay Wrap and picked up a few samosas from their hot buffet. The Bombay Wrap took a bit longer to come out than I had expected but then it was made to order. The ingredients were fresh and prepared well. Samosas were charged by weight so they ended up being fairly expensive.The real downside to this shop is the inadequate seating. There really isn't much of a dining area you're much better off doing take out. The overflowing trash bin was a bit of a turnoff too." u"I wanted to like this place but don't think I'll be going back. It is buffet style (hot and cold lunch) salad bar and cafe. There's a lot going on so you definitely need to know what you came in for.I got a mix of the hot buffet but with so many options you don't know what to get! The masala vegetables I tried were pretty good but several raw healthy verge options to top off my meal. I also picked up a sweet treat at the end by the counter. The banana bread was average- nothing great. The total for both of those ran me over $13. For an assortment of lunch food it's slightly on the pricey side. Maybe this style of restaurant isn't my thing since I can't really put together what I want from a buffet if I'm paying by weight.Everything looked yummy- but I would suggest sticking to 1 or 2 dishes in the buffet line." u'Average place the lady at the counter could be nicer to customers.... Food is nothing extraordinary but not too expensive ether. Definitely not 4 stars in my standards...' u"Bought an oat bar square (~$4) turkey wrap (~$7) and a drink which I fell in love with. The turkey wrap was delicious despite being prepackaged/cold. It had a hint of sweetness (from a fruit maybe cranberries?) and crunchiness from the walnuts in it.The Oat bar was the bomb! There was a good amount of sweetness and extremely filling. It was like a meal which I didn't expect at first because it seemed like a medium sized square! Don't be fooled it is quite heavy! The lychee drink I had was the most refreshing drink and so gooood! I'm searching everywhere for it now! I would take that over a smoothie any day! Awesome place~" u'a good lunch place for vegetarians definitely. The only thing weird is that the menu and the setting is. little confusing. Took me 5 mins to figure out what to and how to order. But overall salads are nice and so is the food quality.' u"Green Symphony is a great little hole in the wall deli/bodega that's definitely more on the healthy/natural side of things. I've been coming here for a few years and I love it. I love their hot bar I've also ordered off their menu a few times and I've loved everything I've had. Their food takes a few minutes for them to make so I recommend ordering ahead if you're picking up. Also it gets quite busy during lunch so again call ahead. I love Jae he owns the place and he is awesome. My only beef with Green Symphony is that their credit card minimum is So high ($15!!!) and I never have cash. Honestly I would probably go to Green Symphony all the time if they didn't have a card minimum so I guess in that way they have saved me money." u"This place is the best for a healthy affordable lunch/dinner in Times Square. I found it on Yelp when I was working a job in the area. I usually order a juice or a smoothie and get one of the spelt flour or oat based baked goods. They take credit cards ($10 min which I usually hit with my order). You can get salad or hot bar but I've never tried them. It's groovy tasty and there are even a few tables you can sit and eat at." u'We actually went there and thought it is a big restaurant but found out that it is just a small place with couple of tables. Items look clean and healthy but the pace was smelly.' u"Wow. Fresh cheap filling and healthy and in Midtown? Amazing. The rice bowls and smoothies are fantastic. Can't wait to frequent this newfound gem near my job!"]
108.Tender,[u"Dined here for a second date on a Tuesday night International Woman's Day. The ambiance felt upscale relaxed and romantic. Great furnishings that remind you why you are paying so much money for the food. Definitely felt like a place where you would dress up and plan to have a special occasion. Service was good our waiter did his best to check in on us every 10 minutes which became annoying at one point because we kept stopping our conversations to assure him that the food was nice. He was doing his job though so points for that not his fault that we wanted to be left alone and enjoy our meal and conversation without being interrupted every few minutes.The prices are expensive. We got a shrimp cocktail for $24 and they brought four shrimps and tons of sauce. We both laughed how such a huge metal chalice filled with sauce could've used more than four shrimps considering how much it cost. The waiter brought out the chalice as liquid nitrogen was coming out of it so I guess they thought that the smoky effect was worth the price.My date ordered a NY strip steak $45 a small yet delicious piece of meat which came with a satisfyingly big bowl of garlic truffle fries that were top notch crunchy and flavorful. I got branzino $28 that exceeded all my expectations. I cook delicious branzino so I had a high bar for this fish and the dish went beyond that. The fish had a golden delicious well spiced garlicky skin and came with green miso sauce on a pile of sweet sauted vegetables that were cooked to perfection changing my opinion about how delicious greens can be when prepared with finesse and imagination.For dessert my date got a way overpriced dry tiny cube of tiramisu $12 which did not taste anywhere half as good than the tiramisu that I make which costs me way less. The three scoops of gelatto that I got were amazing--strawberry amaretto and banana chocolate chip are highly recommended!Overall would return to try other dishes and enjoy the ambiance for a special occasion when I will not feel guilty about splurging so much on food which is overpriced if you do not check out other reviews and see the photos and descriptions of each dish to determine if it's worth it in your opinion." u'Lonely space and very broody. Dark overpriced but the service was good. Had the crab roll appetizer and the crispy rice app. Both were solid. A-OK.' u'This whole place made me feel scammed from the get go. It was not a "tender" feeling upon our exit. I made the reservation here because of the options on the menu and the seemingly good deal of the pre theatre prix fixe menu listed on the restaurant\'s own website. \xa0When we arrived they gave us no prix fixe menu and said the prix fixe menu was not available on Saturday\'s only weekdays. It\'s called a theatre prix fixe menu - why would that only be during the week and not Saturday which is the most popular theatre night? Then they said they could "accommodate" us by"allowing" us to order from the prix fixe menu anyway. But the prix fixe menu they handed us had totally different prices and food options than the one on the site. When I pulled up the menu on my phone they gave a lot of excuses again as to why it was a different menu and said someone may not have updated the website. Are you kidding me? They then tried to come up with another "accommodation" plan to "allow" us to SHARE the filetmignon prix fixe and some sides. What?!?! They should just honor what is on their own website. If a customer points out an error (your error) you fix it. On top of that the food came out wrong and the steak knives were so dull none of us could cut our lamb chops and had to use the butter knife. The manager did not approach us (even though he saw the poor waiter trying to fix the situation) until we were half way through the meal. When he asked how the food was two of us shrugged our shoulders and I said "the food was ok". He seemed satisfied with that answer and told us to enjoy the rest of our meal. Huh? Were you even listening? If I was running a restaurant and the guests said the experience was "ok" I would find out how it could have been better. He couldn\'t care less. All in all the food was pretty decent but for the price I would expect better service and concern for a customer\'s satisfaction. We\'ll never go back and be sure to tell anyone we can to avoid this place.' u"The wait staff is very friendly and on their game..Well I really want to love this place. \xa0Great location for my work but honestly the most unaccommodating sushi chef ever. \xa0He refused to make me a protein toll wrapped in sea weed. \xa0He would make it in cucumber but not wrapped in sea weed. \xa0So I was desperate for food so I could take some medication so I ordered the salmon roe. He literally plopped it in some sea weed. I had asked to fill it with cream cheese or anything. But got nothing. Second time I have tried this place and been sorely disappointed. \xa0What a shame they don't hire a more accommodating sushi chef. I would have been better off with street food." u"Came here this last weekend for a friend's birthday dinner. We reserved a table for 9 at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. To be honest I didn't really get a good look at the place since my back was towards the center restaurant area. BUT service was AMAZING!!! Everyone who attended our table was the best (esp our waiter). We ordered appetizers but he brought out extra so we all could have a taste of what we ordered. Awesome-ness. Everyone ordered different things but here's what I had. I got the Atlantic salmon. It was delicious! I'm not always too big on ordering salmon since it can be cooked terribly wrong at some places but here you won't be disappointed. I had a piece of the porter house. Delicious! And it's for sure big enough for 2 to share like it says on the menu. The avocado fries...were disappointing. Everyone on Yelp rave at it so I made it a point to order it but it didn't reach the hype. The spicy tuna crispy rice was super good though! Get it. The baked crab hand roll was good too but I really enjoyed the spicy tuna crispy rice. Had also the bite of my friends' Truffle Taglitelli...so good! If you're feeling pasta this dish will hit the spot. But if you're not a creamy sauce fan then you might want to stay away. And at the end since it was my friends bday they brought out the HUGE Sunday in that huge martini glass. Not sure how much that was but its def enough for a table of 10. Maybe it tasted delicious because I was a little buzzed at that point but it wasn't a let down. I still ate it even though I was completely full from appetizers and main course. I think what I took most out of Tender was the customer service. It was beyond great." u"If I lived in NYC I'd definitely be a regular! The overall experience was great from the food to the ambiance to the company. The venue is posh slightly rustic and romantic with dim lighting and comfortable seating. The attached bar next door can be a little loud but the dining area was comfortable and we had little difficulty hearing one another. This is a big bonus for an NYC restaurant in the middle of all the Christmas festivities attractions and shows at Rockefeller Center. We ordered the sunset roll which was amazingly delicious. Probably the best quality sushi I've ever had. Please order it you won't be disappointed. We also ordered the New York strip because after all we were in New York! I only had a few bites as I'm not a big meat eater but my counterpart seemed to thoroughly enjoy my portion. We also ordered the asparagus and truffle fries. They were good but not great. The cab however was fab! I'd give the food 4-stars but the venue tips the scale to 5. This place is a gem that I definitely recommend!" u'Loved this place. The food was spectacular and they had great music. The d\xe9cor is fun!! Service was great too! I will definitely be back.' u'I enjoyed my meal at Tender. The food was good and the decor was beautiful! Instead of ordering entrees my mom and I split a few appetizers. \xa0My favorite dish was the "Croquette Roll" which was just added to the sushi menu. \xa0It was one of the best rolls I\'ve ever had! \xa0The Croquette Roll was made up of tuna cream cheese and avocado. \xa0The roll was lightly fried and breaded with Panko. \xa0I had never thought of Panko on sushi but it was phenomenal!We also ordered the "Tender Roll" which is raw tuna and pickled jalapenos topped with Rock Shrimp tempura- I wasn\'t super impressed with this roll. It was lacking something. \xa0As our side we ordered the Avocado Fries- I highly recommend these! \xa0The avocado is lightly breaded and fried in tempura. \xa0For dessert I ordered the chocolate mousse and my mom ordered the Spanish Flan. \xa0Both were so tasty!The restaurant\'s decorations are gorgeous! \xa0It has a very trendy metropolitan atmosphere. \xa0There were lots of concrete statues and dim red lighting. \xa0The sushi chef and bar are in the middle of the dining room. \xa0I will certainly be returning the next time I am in NYC!' u"**Restaurant Week Summer 2015 LUNCH review**3.5 stars rounded up.An ex-colleague and I tried out Tender for RW lunch last week. \xa0This is a really loungey romantic looking place for a casual lunch. \xa0They play a lot of top-40 mellow-y music too (Adele Christina Perri...)Ruggy was right - those AVOCADO FRIES! \xa0It's like good fat on fat on fat on fat but they give you a ton of avocado fries in a pile (that eventually fell over when the waiter put down the plate). \xa0Comes with ranch dressing. \xa0But seriously these are lightly battered and fried and you realize you're eating fried avocado and this is really bad for you because it's like eating two whole avocados + the oil and batter. \xa0//end rant. \xa0TL;DR - get the damn avocado fries already! \xa0I also had the shrimp cocktail which was surprising given how big the shrimp are and the fact that they give you 5 big ones.For our entrees we both got the black cod which had wonderfully crispy skin on the top and a delicious spicy sauce. \xa0It sat on a bed of spinach mushrooms and various peppers (hated the peppers was too strong of a flavor for the dish) and had miso broth poured around the side. \xa0The fish was cooked well.Desserts were freaking massive. \xa0Like full size HUGE desserts. \xa0Way too much amaretto ice cream and chocolate mousse. \xa0Basically wanted to die of being too full.For the $25 RW price point this was definitely worth it. \xa0Portions were huge and the food was great. \xa0However the atmosphere of this place made me feel a little strange like it should be 11pm and burlesque dancers running around the place or something." u"Came in for just a couple of drinks. Kendall not only prepared new drinks to order but also provided an amicable atmosphere that we enjoyed very much! Made a great Pimm's cup without any proper knowledge. Definitely knows what she's doing as a bartender." u'Very pleasant experience! All staff was very courteous and made us feel very welcomed especially our waiter Tamur (not sure about spelling). Our glasses with water were always full. Food was unexpectedly good for this touristy area. We ordered tuna tartar beef sliders - my daughter really liked them and finished very quickly and branzino-fish was excellent vegetables were a little bit salty for my taste but cooked really nice.' u'Visited for dinner a choice of eating downstairs but we took the lift to the rooftop terrace. Food was very good a varied menu. Views gave a 180deg show of lights and color staff were polite and prompt. Good music playing and a nice cocktail to finish. Would recommend' u"Pricey it is for the quality of the food. I'll have to say it reminds me of an upscale club atmosphere and all the servers/hostess were gorgeous. Fancy schmancy. The sushi was not exactly the freshest and the avocado fries were just....lightly breaded and fried avocadoes. Not very hard to make imo. The yuzu margarita was probably the highlight of the meal. This is a nice place for a date if you want to impress someone but if you are looking for delicious food there are other options nearby." u'I am just enjoying my Friday afternoon beer at the Tenders with amazing entertainment. Especially my waiter is a blast. He is a European American mixture. Amazing stories. I think his name is Tamir. Ask for him if you are in need of entertainment!' u"2 starts for service 4 stars for food.The food was good enough to come back here again and give it another shot even though the service was very bad our first visit.Service: Service is terrible. On our first visit they had forgot my wife's appetizer and by the time they brought it out...almost immediately after our entrees came. It was not paced out and they definitely lacked attention. We chalked it up to a poor server. BUT the second time we came...the place was empty (early time to catch a show) and service was still poor. It took 3 requests to get water. There were 6 employees there with 3 tables and they were too busy chatting amongst themselves to keep an eye on the tables. Everything took longer than necessary especially when I had instructed the server at the beginning that we had a show to catch. A woman in all black that seemed to hover/roam around the other employees (was she a manager? IDK) seemed to just stand along the hostess for a while and must have noticed we began to get upset but still did absolutely nothing...Drinks: The cocktails were..all right/average. Wine alright as well. First time they gave my wife the bottom of the bottle of a decent cab but we dont know how long it was sitting and she remarked it tasted like it was over-aired.Food: Their saving grace. The tuna rice crisp and petite filet was delicious. We've ordered on restaurant week menu as well as regular menu in past. Enjoyed the creme brule. We had high hopes for the steak tartare but it was only average. Our second time here we both ordered the petite filet.Although I did enjoy my meal ...the service leaves so much to be desired. The lack of service kills the experience. It just makes no sense to me that a restaurant with that many staff members that is 80% empty could do so poorly in the service department." u'In short: mediocre.I had a bad appetizer (avocado fritters were dry mushy and bland) a decent entree (cod was great but the dish felt incomplete without a carbohydrate ingredient) and an excellent dessert (chocolate mousse).The space is pretty and the service was alright but nothing that would make me want to come back.' u'They have great steak and sushi and the service is amazing. \xa0Ask for Tamir. Try the sunset roll and the Brussels sprouts' u"Wow!!!! I had a LivingSocial deal and took my boyfriend there because we're both sushi lovers. The deal was edamame four sushi rolls two cocktails and a dessert. We got the sunset roll (my favorite) pink panther roll (my boyfriend's favorite)  the spider roll and the rainbow roll and holy cow were they good.... The edamame did not disappoint either; roasted in ginger and garlic made it dilectable. He got the dark and stormy and I got the shadow another amazing addition to this feast. We splurged and got the banana split--best decision of our lives! It came in one of those GIANT martini glasses with 4-6 scoops of ice cream whipped cream chocolate sauce cherries all over bits of other fruit on top four banana slices and a brownie on the bottom. It was also adorned with gold flecks for flare. We successfully put ourselves in a food coma :)" u'Service was spotty. \xa0Took awhile to take the order. \xa0We were not asked about drinks. \xa0Bread came out quite awhile after we ordered. \xa0Long time before asked about dessert too late to order any. \xa0Food was pretty good. \xa0Ambiance is kind of trendy and pretty dark. \xa0Better to come when not in a rush and with flashlight.' u"Nice location close to our hotel. Stopped here for a very late lunch and some drinks. Unfortunately their bartender had a personal emergency so they weren't able to show us their cocktail menu as no one else could make the cocktails or something. We ordered avocado fries edamame and some sushi. Everything came out very quickly and tasted good. The edamame in particular had a very flavorful ginger glaze they were tossed with. Delicious but very messy! Sushi was good about the quality I would expect from a place like this.Wait staff was attentive but not overly friendly. We probably didn't look like big tippers. I'd like to come back and try out some of the other things on the menu. It's steak and sushi so be ready for a little sticker shock. I think our bill was $160 (before tip) for three people all of us had a couple drinks."]
177.John’s of Times Square,[u"John's is a fast casual full service pizza joint housed in a former church. The remaining stained glass from the church days is beautiful.This place gets absolutely swamped due to its location in the Theater District and proximity to Times Square. But they handle the business well and will seat you quickly and efficiently.Home of that delicious thin crust NY pizza I recently opted for their Margherita. Tons of fresh mozzarella basil and the perfect sauce.Got a side of 2 meatballs. There was enough sauce on them so I could dip my pizza crust!Opt for a large pie. The price isn't that much different and you'll get a better NY experience.Full bar.As with all Casual dining restaurants in the city-- avoid the desserts! They are not fresh. But they have like fifteen different ones if you want to take a chance. But stick with the Pizza! It's the best." u"We made a special trip to John's to get New York Pizza for our new-to-New York friends.The pizza was delicious enough but the bottom was soggy (no vegetables on this pizza- which is what usually makes pizza soggy). \xa0Being an OG New Yorker I was craving Chicken Parmigiana! \xa0The bolognese sauce was perfection but... the pasta was a soggy reheat from yesterday and the chicken was quite obviously also a re-cook from yesterday as it was tough as leather. \xa0We were the first lunch customers opened the place as a matter of fact... so it was easy to figure out that we were getting leftovers. The pizza was made fresh and the Caesar Salad was made fresh and the side of anchovies was an anchovy lover's portion. \xa0Practically an anchovy entree'! YumWe finished the pizza  and the Caesar Salad and left the limp pasta and tough chicken behind." u"Ever since I discovered this place several years ago I always go there to get the pizza when I'm in NYC. Sometimes I'll go to NYC just to eat this pizza and the Garlic Bread of course. Although I do like Ray's pizza as well this pizza isn't as greasy.There is always a wait and oftentimes you have to maneuver through a crowd to get from the entrance to the dining area.I knocked off a star because of the wait for the pizza. For some reason it took a very long time to get the pizza last night. Yes they were busy. They're always busy and I've never had to wait as long as I did. If I were out by myself or with friends I wouldn't mind the wait but I was with a 2 year old who didn't want to sit still and the wait was excruciating. The pizza did pass the taste test of a 2 year old who only likes French fries cookies and ice cream." u"Such a fun place to get some New York pizza in Times Square! We came here for dinner on a Sunday after seeing matinee of a Broadway show. The place was packed but our party of four was seated right away in the upstairs section. It makes sense they would have a table for us because the restaurant is HUGE! It's two stories with incredibly tall ceilings and lots of tables packed in. A beautiful dining space that also feels casual and friendly. Our waitress wasn't the friendliest but she was fast and she got the job done. It was clear she was super busy so I understand why she wouldn't mince words at every table. We ordered the large Traditional pizza a classic cheese pizza with 8 large slices definitely enough food for four people. It was piping hot and totally delicious. That thin-but-not-crunchy crust that I love with fresh-tasting sauce and mozzarella. We also shared the house salad which was a little small for the four of us (each of us only got a few bites) and fairly unimpressive with lots of raw onions and a conventional vinaigrette dressing. If you're looking to eat some classic New York pizza and you happen to be near Times Square (and you're a tourist yourself or don't mind eating among lots of tourists!) this is a great choice." u"I was in the neighborhood this past weekend & we decided to get something to eat. Came in no problem being seated once seated we got a Pitcher of the IPA beer & some chocolate milk for the kids. Beer was great enough for 3 to share  the chocolate milk was good as well nice & cold. Appetizers we started with the Mozzarella wedges  this was pretty good nice tasting cheese fried yes but it wasn't greasy good dipping sauce.Main dishes we got a Margarita pizza w grilled chicken & an order of the Penne a la vodka with grilled chicken as well. Pizza was good  nice tasting with lots of basil good overall. Penne a la vodka was pretty good as well good sauce & chicken not to crazy about the peas but they were ok. as for the place itself nice size plenty with seating. simple decor good service & decent prices." u"I have to say that I was rather skeptical of this pizzeria considering that a lot of places have made a big name for themselves Roberta's Patsy's Motorino and Paulie Gee's to name a few top places. But John's definitely represented themselves well and worth every bite. In fact we not only went for lunch but after walking off the pie we went back for a late night to go pie back to our hotel. Conveniently located across the alley way from the Marriott passed Junior's restaurant. Prices are reasonable we sat at the bar since it was only two and chatted up with the bartender each time. If I'm ever in the city again it'll be my go to spot. Big Fan!" u"Brick cooked pizza was pretty good. My son wanted an all-meat pizza with prosciutto bacon and pepperoni. Nothing was left behind. All slices eaten we also had a Hawaiian pizza. That was delicious as well. We had deserts to finish off the night. Strawberry New York style cheesecakes as well another desert with hazelnut who's name escapes me. Had a strawberry gelato. Yum!! \xa0Ambiance is good and the round table that seated us was enough for 8. \xa0Our waiter was very friendly and helpful." u"My brother heard about this pizza joint from the flight attendant on the way to NYC. So we decided to walk over to the pizza joint that once was a church. We walk up and AMEN we forgot that it was Easter! So we decided to come back the next day in which we did. We walk in and the bar is to your right with the hostess some tables and a seating area to the left. We were seated in front of the stone oven fire where the delicious pizza is being created!We got to select our toppings and opt for pepperoni bacon mushrooms sausage. It was delicious! The decor was easy on the eyes also! I wish I tried other pizza places in NYC to compare but I was content with the what was deliciously served to us at John's." u"Came here with a bunch of friends. Being right on Times Square and on a Saturday during the day I expected the place to be packed. Thankfully we were seated right away. For being in Times Square the place is quite huge and is also quite beautiful (read on the menu it was converted from a church).The service was pretty prompt. We got a sausage and red pepper pizza with some garlic knots. The garlic knots were good a typical appetizer you would get at a pizza joint. The pizza was pretty great. Wasn't the best in the world but it was a pretty good thin crust. The flavors were all there and the dough was cooked perfectly. I haven't tried other NYC pizza to compare so it's hard to say if this is the best in the area but for being in a populated block it was nice for the convenience." u'As good as always. Just missing my friend Rae Norris!!!! \xa0Great atmosphere. \xa0Close to theaters. Delicious!!!!' u"So we are in NY for a few days and decided to come here for some New York pizza after it being recommended to us by one of the workers in Time Square. I have to say that the setting ambiance architecture and design are really cool! This place used to be an actual church and the place is huge. With regards to the food we ordered a couple of pizzas for a quick lunch before heading out to see some more sights. It was really busy so the food took a good while to come out which was to be expected due to the crowd. The pizza was a bit of a let down. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either... I would just rate it as average. I am from Miami and we have a few NY style pizzerias that I really enjoy there. The pizza here does not compare. I hate to say it but I actually like Papa Johns better than John's Pizzeria. Again I didn't dislike the pizza... Just expected better. The staff were friendly and attentive and we enjoyed our overall experience but I would definitely not come here for the pizza again. They have a full menu so I can't say how any of the other options are but I would be willing to try those. The prices are also a bit on the high side. These are the reasons for 3 stars." u"John's is a neat location. An old church that has been converted to a pizza hall. There are stain glass windows in the walls and ceiling. The walls are covered in ink drawings. Large open dining area lets you look around while waiting. The pizza oven is right off the main dining area and you can watch the pizza's bake.We added meatball and spinach to the margherita pizza. It was very good and the first slice had a crispy crust. By the second moisture had started to soften the crust and that detracted from the quality of the pizza.Server was good and I tipped him extra.I would go to some other pizza places before I said this is the best." u'Fav dishes are wings calamari  bruschetta and Hawaiian pizza. Pasta primavera  fettuchini Alfredo were our favorites.' u'Based on recommendations of front desk and concierge we ordered Johns Pizza of Times Square for delivery. \xa0 The good: quoted estimated time of 45 minutes but delivered in 30 minutes. \xa0The bad: \xa0 Average thin crust greasy pizza with burned edge. \xa0 Not a fan. \xa0Would never buy again.' u'Great location but terrible food and service. \xa0Went to dinner at Johns after a wonderful showing of Something Rotten at the theater next door. \xa0Had a bit of a wait before being seated so ordered a glass of wine and a draft beer from the bar -- $15.00. $8.00 for a Rebel IPA is a bit much but okay we are in Times Square. We get seated and our "server" came over to begrudgingly take our orders. You know the guy that won\'t make eye contact with you and has to stare around the room constantly to see what else is going on? \xa0Right that was our server. Seemed more interested in what was going on 3 tables over than what our order was going to be. We get our order placed -- one large pizza and a meatball sub appetizer of garlic bread. Sounds pretty simple? One would think.Server I believe his name was Frank didn\'t come back to the table during our entire wait time. Not to refill drinks take additional drink orders or to just check on us. \xa0Nothing.My meatball sub gets delivered to the table and I told the expediter that we were still waiting for our garlic bread app. He goes to check-on the order and takes the meatball sub with him. Several minutes go by and the garlic bread comes out. Several minutes more pass and the pizza comes out. Finally the meatball sub comes back and it was not a fresh sandwich but rather the sandwich that was brought out 25 minutes ago that someone thought was a good idea to put under the heating element in the back to wait.During all of this our server came no where near the table. He went to the table next to us hung out at the server station and stared all around the restaurant while carefully avoiding any eye contact with our table. He was done. He made a brief appearance to drop off the check and to pick up payment.One thing you can usually count on at a table service restaurant in NY is great service. Professional servers who make good money and take pride in their jobs and the service they provide. John\'s was the exception. This server should find another occupation and run away from the hospitality business. He did not have the temperament nor the aptitude for food service and appears to just not give a crap about his customers.There are too many great pizzerias in New York to settle for bad service and sub par food. Do yourself a favor pick one of the other great restaurants and pass on this place. Your wallet belly and mood will thank you for it.' u"John's is the best pizza we've found near Times Square yet. Our spinach and cheese pizza rolls with marinara were amazing (wish I would've snapped a photo) and our pepperoni pizza was yummy.The style of the restaurant was really cool as well.The reason for the 4 stars is the slow service. We probably sat at our table for 10 mins. before we were served water.We will definitely recommend to friends." u"Normally there are really only three reasons I can think of to eat near Times Square: 1. You are a tourist and just do tourist things all the time because you are glutton for punishment.2. You are in the area for some other reason (Broadway show etc.) and need to find something quick.3. It's late you're hungry and you are staying nearby but don't wish to wander out of the area.As someone from an extremely touristy part of the world I never do #1. That's just self-hatred. I readily do the other 2 though.This was option #3. It was pouring rain the traffic in midtown was nightmarish and we were starving after just arriving at our TS hotel from a flight that repeatedly circled around NYC for almost 2 hours before we were allowed to land.We went to John's based on the online reviews and had a decent dinner. They serve brick oven pizza not true NYC greasy awesome mess street pizza. The service was way better than I expected on TS and the prices weren't bad at all.I'd call this an extremely positive experience. It wasn't going to blow our socks off but it was quite nice. I would go here again if I was in town under even vaguely similar conditions. It wouldn't even take it being *last resort* food like this situation initially was. The John's Garlic Rolls were delicious." u"Authentic New York Pizza to the core. This is a massive two story restaurant located directly in the theater district. On the lower level on opposite sides they have 2 pizza over stations. They are stretching tossing dressing and cooking pizzas non stop. The wait can be long but it is so worth it. \xa0They have severe locations throughout the city but this review is just on this location. They don't give free refills on soda as an FYI which is the norm for NYC. Being away from NYC for so long I was not accustomed to this when the check came. I believe it was $2.50 per cup of soda.The garlic knots were delicious as well. \xa0I would highly recommend them if you are not worried about carbohydrate intake." u"Came here with some friends since we're tourists and I did not choose the place. I was honestly not expecting a whole lot but I was open to giving it a try. We had done it family style and gotten to try different pizzas but honestly none of them really wow-ed me. I ate some of the mushroom pizza and a cheese one and it just tasted like basic thin crust pizza. The salad and garlic bread was also very average. I felt like it was just so overhyped. Plus is that they are great with large groups and the upper floor where we were had a private bathroom which was awesome! The interior of this place is also gigantic. It looks almost like it was built in an abandoned church or fire station or something. It was huge. Grand artwork was all over the walls and there was just so much attention to detail although you couldn't see a lot of it because of the extremely dim lighting." u"My boyfriend and I were in search of a good lunch and stopped at John's based on the Yelp reviews. And we couldn't leave New York without pizza! Since it was lunchtime there was a 20 minute wait. Not bad. Although it took awhile for our server to come take our order. My boyfriend ordered a Manhattan and they came back with a drink made with Coke and what tasted like fireball. What? He sent it back and ordered a jack and Coke. Which was a lot smaller for the same price. Confusing. It took while to get our pizza as well but the pizza was very good. We ordered the margarita pizza. It could have used a little more sauce but I was pleased! Overall it was a nice atmosphere with good pizza but the service wasn't the best!"]
197.Blossom Du Jour,[u'This is definitely one of my favorite "fast food joints" in the neighborhood. You heard me right - just because it\'s vegan doesn\'t mean it can\'t be fast food. They (and Chloe) totally changed my understanding of vegan food. I didn\'t know meatless meals could be so good and satisfying. In my opinion the best items on the menu are their sandwiches and the secrets are the sauces. My favorites are Smokey Avocado and Un-Chicken Avocado Griller. Their sides honey mustard bites and buffalo bites are amazing as well. Lastly can\'t finish a meal without the blue velvet smoothie. I am not a big fan of their salads (better salad locations) or their bowls (meh). But I would definitely go for their sandwiches.Note: their foods are still calorie packed but at least it\'s not bad calories.' u"Was looking forward to trying Blossom Du Jour as it is often talked about in vegan discussions of nyc. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with my visit. It's basically fast healthy food but it comes at a pretty steep price. I wanted to order one of the wraps but when I was told I could grab it from the fridge I opted for a burrito that they made fresh. Not about to pay $10 for a refrigerated wrap!! The burrito was just okay. Not a ton of flavor and pretty small. I was still hungry after. There wasn't much in it and honestly I couldn't help but keep comparing it to the amount I would have gotten at Chipotle for the same price. Don't get me wrong I'll always support local before big chains like Chipotle but in this case they offer a much better burrito with lots of fresh veggies and flavor. Blossom's fell completely flat and was about half the size. If you are really pressed for time and in the area and need to grab a vegan bite I guess it will do the trick. But I really wouldn't come out of my way to go here." u'Seating (6 or so high tops) is what sets it apart from the many juice bars in the area. The Blue Velvet their most popular smoothie was most underwhelming. No Acai bowls here.' u"Cannot recommend Blossom du Jour enough.This place is vegan food heaven & my discerning omni friend even said the smoothie she had was the best she'd ever tasted.I loved the hearty black beans yummy marinated 'chicken wings' fresh kale salad & tasty rice with a creamy tahini dressing.Wish we had something like this back home!" u"Cute little vegan fast food joint.My coworker spoke very highly of this place multiple times- so I decided to go with her after work to get some food.There were so many options that sounded amazing but I went for the buffalo wrap. It was REALLY good! It was big enough for me and stuffed and filling. I loved the buffalo sauce it was perfect. It all just tasted exactly like wings in a wrap. I'm not vegan or even vegetarian but I'm super open to both options so as a meat eater I was very impressed. I will be going back to try the sky scraper which I heard great things about as well as the buffalo bites and the taco bowl and even the philly cheesesteak. The wrap was pricey and the staff weren't the most attentive but honestly they weren't rude or anything and seemed to know what they were doing so it's not even a big deal. I will be coming back VERY often since I work just a few blocks away.*** UPDATE ****While I still love the wrap and will be trying other things- I am VERY disappointed in this place because of the sudden switch of the patty in the skyscraper burger. The cashiers did not warn me about the change when I feel like that's important- and didn't express a major concern after my obvious disappointment with the new bean burger and how it hurts my stomach to consume too many legumes. He did offer me a switch but I rejected his offer because I was more upset that he didn't tell me about the change then I was about the food. I didn't eat it but it's fine. I don't believe in wasting product so I didn't take his offer.My friend and I are both very upset about this change??? PLEASE change the patty back. The new one is *terrible*. It tastes like a frozen veggie patty from the market and it looks gross. :( I love this place but I'm so upset." u"Decided to grab something healthy before my night workout. Prefer something carb-free so I built up my own blossom bowl by adding four items - marinated kale mixed veggie scrambled tofu and lemon chicken with herb mustard dressing. Enjoyed their scrambled tofu a lot very soft and flavorful; however chicken was a bit dry and hard to bite. The herb dressing didn't really add any flavor on top so next time I would probably skip...They have very few seats so take-out would be ideal." u'This vegan place is more of a to go place. It is very small with just a few stools lining one wall. Food was excellent though. We tried the following here:-Midtown Melt - One of their most popular items. This sandwich contains seitan (wheat gluten) as the "meat" but the flavor of the sandwich that stood out was the cheese and avocado. Infact it felt like a grilled cheese sandwich to me. Pretty tasty overall.-Philly Cheese Steak - This sandwich also had seitan in it. However the seitan in this one was better marinated and had better flavor. The pepper onions and cheese in it also give it a stronger flavor. We both thought this one was even better than the Midtown Melt.-Buffalo Bites - This side was just okay. They were a little soggy and definitely had the buffalo sauce on them but didn\'t really stand out to us.-Strawberry Banana Smoothie - Tasted like any average smoothie. Hard drink to mess up.Because the two sandwiches we tried were so good we will definitely be back to try other things.' u"I'm really happy with this place. Seriously!I've been craving breakfast food for a very long time and Blossom Du Jour really hit the nail on the head for me. Their Egg Cheese & Bacon Muffin was sooooo good. I couldn't believe how much I missed breakfast.After having the muffin sandwich I decided that I would try more things on their menu and I was not disappointed (they were all equally as good).This place is seriously really good. If I lived here I would be a regular.So if you do live here please check this place out and become a regular in my honor. Kthxbye!" u"Decided to start the day healthy with a vegi based breakfast and actually this is Vegan and the breakfast bowl had scrambled tofu some grilled tempeh roasted sweet potato an some sauteed kale lovely! A friend and I also split the green smoothie and and it was smooth creamy and not overly sweet. The breakfast bowl also comes with a small container of ketchup (not used) and hot sauce (which was great and used a lot of it). I would definitely go back here for breakfast or even lunch if I'm in the area." u"This place was pretty awesome. I found it by mistake but it was an awesome find. They have a great amount of vegan food and it comes out not too much longer after you order it. The staff is pleasant as well. The vibe was chill. Not much room for seating and it seems to be a place to mostly order from when you're on the go. I was also told that they have a full restaurant and a bakery. I definite recommend this place. You have the choice of eating fast food type of food and the option to eat more healthy. I didn't not see if they had any raw dishes but the cooked dishes that I had were pretty good. The chocolate shake is pretty good as well. Whether you're vegan or not it is definitely a place with food that \xa0anyone would like. It was the very first place that I went to once I landed here here in New York." u'Love love love Blossom Du Jour.Always super fast and the people that work there are so nice!LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE The Breakfast Bowl - marinated kale tofu scramble sweet potatoes and tempeh bacon! Add a little hot sauce and you got yourself and scrumptious breakfast...or really any time meal.Definitely excited to make this a new regular spot on my way to work!' u"Tasty but a little pricey! I ordered the Benedict wrap and a mini caesar salad and it was about $13. On the menu it says that the Benedict wrap is tofu vegan ham and vegan hollandaise sauce. The vegan hollandaise sauce was just veganaise and didn't taste like anything special. The wrap however was still pretty good but it's totally something I could make at home. The caesar salad was shredded lettuce capers and dressing and it was the size of a side salad. Not sure why they charge $5 for it because there's literally nothing to it. It was decent however. It's nice to see NY offering vegan options just wish they weren't so pricey. Welcome to New York I guess...." u"Yummy fast vegan food! I love the getting the bowls here. Hearty ingredients with simple good flavors. You can pick any 4 ingredients or choose a standard bowl (various combinations). I love the kale & grilled vegetables. The buffalo chicken bowl is good too.They do use a bunch of faux meat (I think it is gardein brand?). The buffalo chicken and honey mustard bites are gardein's chicken tenders that are flavored accordingly I'm pretty sure. The wraps are good too. I've tried the smoky avocado wrap with tempeh which is really good!! I recommend it.There are a bunch of other sandwiches burgers smoothies milk shakes juices. There is a fridge with some premade salads wraps and desserts. New menu items I recently noticed are Philly cheer steak and mac & cheese. I love the banana bread here! A mini loaf of yummy banana bread with chocolate chips. I've also had the mini apple pie which is alright. I have not tried much of the other desserts (cupcakes brownie and cookies). The desserts are standard among all the blossom du jours I believe.The store itself is pretty small with some counter seating. They recently raised prices :/ but I was told they now donate proceeds to various animal charities!All in all a good place for fast vegan food. It is near me so a convenient place to drop by. I have returned several times as it is convenient. Getting a little on the pricey side for basically a take out place though." u'Power salad (pre-made) really hit the spot. Selection is limited but I just what I needed.' u'I got a nice note from Blossom after posting my mostly positive review with the little whine about needing coffee. They informed me coffee was on the way that the previous lack of coffee was logistical not ideological and they apologized sincerely that I felt "judged" for my caffeine habit (OK addiction). \xa0So I\'m upping my review to 5 stars partly out of guilt for my misplaced paranoid whining but mostly out of appreciation for the personal outreach which clearly puts Blossom in the top tier for customer service. Here\'s the original:4 stars for a great concept well executed - fast food vegan for breakfast lunch and dinner. The only downside was that when this non vegan ventured in for breakfast (a very fine breakfast scramble in a gluten free wrap) and discovered there was no coffee I got a bit of a smoothie or juice sales pitch "if you need a boost." When I held out for Java the "so you\'re a solid caffeine person" felt just a bit judgy. That\'s when I realized they didn\'t serve coffee for health reasons. Maybe it\'s just me but I felt redeemed enough for passing up the NYC diner experience without needing to go in for the full on organic cleanse. But enough about me - Blossom du Jour is a great concept that deserves to be more than just an eating fad du jour.' u'The blossom bowls are the best. A mixture of your choosing. Everything is extremely fresh and the color of placement makes the food and aesthetic more presentable. The wait was not too bad. The employees were okay nothing spectacular or mind-blowing but the food is good portion and it is definitely a "healthier" alternative. The price is reasonable. I will need to try the juice next time!' u'Came here for my first NYC meal and was not disappointed! Blossom was a close walk from my hotel (2 minutes max) so first of all location was super convenient. I brought my non vegan family and they were super impressed by the real-ness of the "meats." I got the \'Un-chicken avocado pesto sandwich" and it tasted exactly like real chicken-too good! My mom got the taco bowl and it was super delicious and filling. Would recommend both dishes!' u"Blossom du Jour was okay overall but I've definitely tasted better Vegan food. Custom Blossom Bowl - I ordered marinated kale tofu scramble lemon un-chicken grilled vegatables and the beet burger pattie.- Un-chicken was my favorite part of this bowl. Well textured and flavored! Items like these make me want to eat more vegan.- Tofu scramble was great. Solid seasoning and texture to the tofu scramble with the right balance of chopped vegetbales mixed in. - Marinated kale came out soggy and overly oiled for my liking.- The roasted carrots that came as my grilled vegetables were way too overcooked. I typically love roasted carrots but these didn't seem edible due to the way they were cooked.- In a bowl setting I would avoid getting the beet burger pattie because it lacked flavor as a stand-alone item. I would consider getting it again in a burger but this item didn't meet my expectations.Buffalo Bites- Great flavor and couldn't even tell that these weren't made with real chicken!- Similar to other reviews these were a little too soggy for my liking. When I think of buffalo bites I imagine a balanced crunch in the exterior with the sauciness from the buffalo flavor. However these just came out as if someone took a mixture of batter and buffalo sauce and lathered them over the un-chicken bites. Would give this another shot in the future but can't say that this was my favorite lunch order." u"Outstanding vegan fare even for someone who's not vegan or even vegetarian (although I aspire to be for health and planetary reasons). The smoked tempeh wrap is a thing of beauty. Hope they don't change!" u"First off my one star is because of their Service The food I give 4 stars. So this isn't the first time I've have problems with Ordering & delivery I'm pissed  my mom just ordered and it has been an hour  we call to say we will be picking up Just arrived and they had Forgotten  yea They FORGOT to tell the delivery man which is at our building now .Wtf? Need to work on communication + service . Also their portions where much more 2 yrs ago.Given that I can get a full vegan plate with veggie meat at veggie heaven for 9$ maxThis is deff over priced too. A shame because they could do better ..."]
119.Ellen’s Stardust Diner,[u'I came here for the first time on a Thursday morning (after hanging around Good Morning America) around 9:20am. There was no wait or line outside the door. The diner was 1/4 full but the service and waitstaff were fully alert with great service. Service: I was asked numerous times if I needed anything else and if I was doing alrightFood: I ordered the Short Stack pancakes with sausage and scrambled eggs and had one cup of coffee. The pancakes were well done and the food was well. The only downside I have * the syrup provided is packaged so no homemade or good branded syrup here. Nevertheless it was good.Price: total came to be $22.26 w/ tax. A little more pricey than i expected but the atmosphere of the waitstaff and the host made it worth a great time! Singing waitstaff: they were great! No much pause in between waiters taking turns singing which is great because they keep the environment upbeat. Overall great first experience minus the price but will definitely come by again!' u"Came here on a Tuesday morning for breakfast as my friend was adamant he wanted to try it after several years of actually coming to New York.There was no line and we were seated quickly by the host and presented with the menu.Our server Brandi was friendly and quickly took our drinks orders whilst we mused over the menu.I ordered the fruit cup and steak with eggs and my friend ordered eggs with bacon and sausage patties. I asked for my steak to be cooked medium and my eggs scrambled and we both ordered a side of toast to go with it.Food came and unfortunately my steak looked like something straight out of a low rent grocery store bargain bin. It was a pale grey colour and almost anaemic looking. I cut into it and upon lifting it to my mouth to test it out was met with a very unpleasant odour emitting from it. Needless to say I did NOT eat this mystery meat slab and instead just finished my (dry) scrambled egg and toast. My friends breakfast looked somewhat better but not amazing but he definitely had the better end of the deal.Fruit cup was ok. Small and not exactly generous with the actual fruit included. Overpriced for its insane $7.50 price tag. Coffee was refilled without me asking by several servers including Brandi in between ditties and songs.Entertainment must surely be the reason people flock to this place as it most definitely isn't the food. It's for sure a tourist trap and I wouldn't recommend it unless you have an immature palate and are not a foodie. The singing was good with some better than others and with my friend and I both being in the arts ourselves we understand that you do what you have to do in between jobs.Would I go again? Absolutely not. Food was below average and massively overpriced. \xa0Decor inside is old worn and tired and not cute and retro like it so desperately tries to come across as.I urge you to stay away and spend your dollars on a real Broadway show and some decent food." u"Brought my daughter here back in May for lunch during a mom-daughter day in the city. Came back Friday for lunch with my son and daughter because my daughter enjoyed it so much. The entertainment is tons of fun; the waitstaff take turns singing all sorts of songs and they are really good! The service last time was not good. Our waitress never checked back on us. On Friday the service was fabulous and our waitress was so attentive even while performing. I gave it 4 stars only because of the food - it isn't anything special but it is good. If you're looking for a fun meal this is definitely touristy but tons of fun." u'LOVE THIS PLACE! Waiters are singing while you are eating;) The best Broadway experience.Anyway food is nice they have a really good orange juice. Prices are affordable. If you are coming during the weekends approx. after 9:30am you have to wait for half an hour. So I recommend to come at 9!' u"I came I saw I conquered...Making only one visit here in life is more than enough. We visited Ellen's Stardust Diner at the suggestion of a family member. It was a fun way to end time in New York. The waitstaff serenade guests with their melodic tunes while they dine. It's all fun and games. There's a host who serves as the Master of Ceremony and between duties the servers each grab the mic and begin to sing. The song selection leaves a bit to be desired but each and every single person who sang had a solid voice. The food is horrible. We ordered breakfast. I had the waffles and my husband had a breakfast sandwich. No sides were included with the waffle. The sandwich had dry tater tots. Overall the experience is fun but the food falls flat. There's no reason to return for me but I can say that it's a fun experience to add to your trip if you're doing the tourist thing." u"This place was absolutely fantastic! Of course the entertainment from the servers was amazing and they are all Broadway ready and working hard for it. We were also pleasantly surprised to have very good service they took care of everything and our guy was very friendly. The overall atmosphere of the place was great and very high energy. Our food was amazing I very much recommend the Train Wrap if you don't happen to be in the burger mood. Overall a very highly recommended experience for anyone! Will definitely be back next time I make it to New York!" u"It's always great to come to New York and actually go places late at night. It's 11pm and this place is going strong. Great food great staff and great entertainment. Very fun diner." u"Love this concept! Apparently Mary Jane from the Original Spiderman used to work in a diner like this. I first heard about this through a friend who came to visit New York. I would say it's among the more touristy things you can do. Get a singing show while you eat! While more popular for their breakfast menu they have an all day breakfast menu. I order the Challah French Toast with a side of berries. I thought it was a little touch to chew but still good. My friends got the Bacon and Eggs the Double Hamburger and the Reuben Sandwich. The Double Hamburger is as LARGE as child's head! I thought the meat was tender and juicy! The TATOR TOTS brings me back to my elementary school days. YUMDidn't get to see or server sing unfortunately. I like the concept of support these rising Broadway stars. Classes for acting singing dancing are expensive and it's great they they can practice and do what they love to reach their true dreams of making it on Broadway. I feel like our food took a little long but you can't tell because you're getting entertained the whole time. I was seriously in awe of how good some of the waiters and waitresses were. It can get pretty loud up in here. We ate with a middle school on their class field trip. But definitely a great place to take the kids!" u'I used to come here every time I took a friend to NYC. Well I took a friend to Times Square and surprised her with this experience. Not disappointed Yes expensve but you get a full on show while you eat. Line si way long so go off hours. People stay too long to watch the show which also delays. We had Mustang Sally as our waitress she was great. Try to sit mid floor downstairs if you want to see everything. The food is fine just overpriced compared to rural NY diners....but this is TIMS SQUARE AND YOU GET A SHOW!!!!!!' u"If you arrive and the line is wrapped around the corner to the alley expect at least a 45 minute wait. \xa0The wait is worth it. \xa0 I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an entertaining night out and couldn't get a hold of theater tickets." u"Been here several times and it has never been a disappointment! Typical diner menu but better! Signature & typically home cooked entrees. I've visited and worked in several entertaining restaurants and the Stardust Diner is the best. Typical Times Square tourist trap prices but so worth the experience. The line outside moves very fast. It's always fun and tasty! DO NOT LET THEM SEAT YOU IN THE BASEMENT!" u"My boyfriend and I decided to eat here on a Friday night because he was craving diner food so I suggested we give Stardust a try because I've heard good things about it. Surprisingly there was no line that night lucky us! I work in the neighborhood and usually every time I pass by there's a line going around the corner and down the block! Stardust has a very retro theme and talented singing waitstaff. Do not expect to have a quiet and uninterrupted meal here! The singing waiters might even drag you away from your meal to entertain with them! They are definitely Broadway material and the restaurant has actually lost a lot of their staff to Broadway. My boyfriend and I ordered the Mac and Cheese Bites Blue Suede Burger and Penne Alfredo. The food was average diner food nothing too special. Clearly people come for the show and not for the food. But I have to admit I'm no tourist but I would love to return just to hear them sing. They are a talented bunch and have really amazing voices. It was like watching a show of various Broadway numbers! It was fun and we had an amazing experience here!" u"I was looking for a kid-friendly spot to take my little cousins and the Stardust seemed to fit the bill. Servers singing songs AND they have crayons? C'mon. I thought I was golden. Unfortunately what you might not know is that people singing songs? With microphones? It's really really loud. Loud enough that you can only hear the people you're with talking about 7% of the time. Loud enough that some kids might clamp their hands over their ears and cry. So if you like the people you're with and actually want to converse I'd go somewhere else.But if your kids don't mind some noise and you want to distract them completely while you eat your own deliciously crispy waffle fries and not talk to each other? This is your place.Your call." u'Such a cool place to visit. I can only give 4 \xa0stars because we only had coffee & brownie dessert. The coffee was good the brownie was a bit dry. 5 stars for the entertainment. Our waitress was very nice & loved all the singing such great voices. Loved watching Ashleythe cute waitress from Chalmette Louisiana. Best of luck to all the workers. Anyone visiting NY you have to go to this place.' u"We go to Ellen's every time we're in NYC. \xa0Sometimes twice. \xa0We usually go late at night. \xa0I must say we go for the singing wait staff not the food. \xa0 There is something tasty on the menu for everyone but there are lots of other good restaurants in New York. \xa0The singing isn't constant but you'll hear plenty of songs. \xa0And it is not background music it's right out there for you to enjoy. \xa0Your waiter puts your food down on your table grabs a mic jumps on the platform between the tables and belts out a rendition of Music of the Night or the like. So cool!!On our last trip we tried to get in late one night but the line was almost a block long. \xa0We went back the next night and walked right in. \xa0In any case keep trying! Well worth it!" u"Ellen's is a great fun lunch place. \xa0It is fun to watch the staff take turns singing. \xa0The food is great casual fare." u"I did not expect to enjoy Ellen's Stardust Diner. First on a recent Sunday night there was a waiting line that wrapped around the corner but it moved very quickly. Ellen's is a tightly-run ship and I have to give thanks to the proprietors for running a first-rate operation. Did I mention the singing servers? So much fun! They interacted with the diners and really seemed to enjoy themselves. I had a falafel salad and it was better than average with plenty of fresh leafy greens and falafel balls that were not greasy. (They must have been baked instead of fried.) The menu is vast and there are plenty of options for vegetarians and vegans. Come for the entertainment - stay for the food and fun." u"This is a fantastic place!! Good food yes!! But the singing waitresses and the entertainment is fantastic!! It's a must to visit this if you enjoy some incredible entertainment during breakfast lunch or dinner!! Thank you" u'ATMOSPHERE: I was excited to try this place when I heard about it when researching places to eat in NY. It\'s a restaurant where people who are trying to make it on Broadway work. They are singing servers who are trying to earn money for acting/dancing/singing school and making it in New York. The place was definitely busy. There were a ton of people. Employees are always singing so it\'s always loud and when we walked in and we\'re getting seated we walked right by one who was. The only thing I really didn\'t like was how incredibly close together things were. I can understand trying to get as much business as possible to support your employees and their dreams but the space between the seats and the table in the booths are thisclosetogehter. SERVICE: Eh. We saw our server the minimum amount of times you need to see one. It took a while for him to get to our table and we had thoughts of leaving... but we held out. We got our drinks fairly quickly and our food came out in a timely manner after ordering that. But for a quite a bit of time I saw our server hanging out and talking to other servers. Eh.FOOD: They do charge a lot here. For a bagel and cream cheese they charge $5.95. That just gives you an idea. I think the average price for a plate of breakfast was $13-15 or so. My fianc\xe9 got the breakfast burrito and I got the smoked salmon. They were both okay. The food tasted like it does at any other "diner-like" location. It wasn\'t the best nor was it the worst. Like other reviews stated you\'re definitely paying for the experience in this place.OVERALL: I don\'t think I\'d visit this place again but I\'m sure glad I at least tried it!' u'A fun touristy place to go to for brunch! I enjoyed listening to the singers as I ate my food.']
154.Schnipper’s Quality Kitchen,[u"I love this place !! \xa0I was looking for a place on 8th Avenue to eat at and decided to give Schnipper's a try. \xa0I was not disappointed. \xa0I was hungry so I ordered two cheeseburgers. \xa0The cashier was very friendly and asked how I was doing. \xa0They give you an electric pad with a number that lights up when your food is ready. \xa0Their system is very efficient and the server who brought my food was also very friendly. \xa0The burgers were great. \xa0They large juicy and tasty. \xa0i was full when I was done eating which is what anybody wants when they leave a restaurant.The price for two cheeseburgers ($6.99 each ) and a bottle of water came out to $16.00. \xa0This is not bad compared to other restaurants in that neighborhood. \xa0Well Schnipper's has made a fan out of me. \xa0Schnipper's will be my first choice when I visit the Theater District and Midtown Manhattan." u"I stopped by the other night due to a craving for fries to be dipped in milk shakes-- so alas we meet again. I really wanted to bump up the rating for this place when interacting with the sweetest cashier ever (she gave me a high five and everything)... But when my milkshake didn't come 25 minutes after my fries had arrived and turned cold.... I was quickly left with disappointment.Fortunately my partner managed to get a hold of the manager who happened to be at the cash register and told her the situation. Apparently the shake was not even in the system and as a result it was never prepared. The manager kindly removed the shake off our receipt and offered us a free one. People/Machhines make mistakes... but the service today was excellent otherwise." u'Went with some friends there last night. Cheese fries literally looked like Burger King Fries with cheese melted in it LololOrdered a Honey Vanilla milkshake. Sooo good.!!I just feel bad for that Penn Station Bathroom...' u"Located directly across the street from the Port Authority station Schnipper's Quality Kitchen serves up good ol' American fast food with an emphasis on freshness.The menu is extensive including burgers fries chicken fingers salads and milkshakes. I decided to go with the two items I see are most popular among my fellow Yelpers here which were their Mac&Cheese and their Sloppy Joe's.The Mac&Cheese was very creamy and decadent feeling. Certainly a lot better than what you would expect for a fast food joint. My only complaint is how small the portion size is. Come on guys don't cheat your patrons like that!!Their Sloppy Joe's was even better. Overstuffed with meaty beef with diced peppers and the right degree of spicyness it really took my back to my childhood of awaiting the special school lunch days when they would serve Sloppy Joe's. The only slight downside here is that they charge rather high for their food. At the end of the day it is all still fast food and you shouldn't have to shell out an average of $15 just for some food and drink." u"Great location in the theater district (in the NY Times building across from the port authority station) this place is always crowded (a good sign) reasonably priced and delicious!I highly recommend the chicken fingers which sound like kid's food but is really some of the best fried chicken you'll get anywhere.Also the mac 'n cheese and pulled pork combo--yum!Even though it's crowded it's still fast. Bright nice staff good design.You can only eat at Shake Shack so often so give this place a try--you'll be glad you did!" u"I have been to other Schnippers a few times but it has been a since I been at the Time Square joint since the PABT and my bus is across the street so I would just go home and get something to eat there instead. \xa0Although most lunch eateries in the Port Authority/Times Square area are dumps and tourist traps not to mention overpriced this place is more reasonable and the food is OK. \xa0They have a wide selection of food but the grilled chicken is a good option if you don't want to do burgers. t. My only complaint is how small the portion size is for let's say Mac & Cheese." u"Time Square sucks. I hate the basic bitch tourists that graze here from the Midworst. If I could I'd bring back the pimps drug dealers crack heads strip clubs and the 24 hour kung-fu theatre. I still miss that New York because at least it was interesting. Sigh. There are a few joints that are worth a taste in this shit show of a hood and this is one of them. The sloppy joes are excellent. Seasoned well it makes you feel like a kid again. It was the first thing I ever had on my initial visit & it should be yours as well. The fried chicken sandwich is superb. It's got a lot of bells & whistles on it but the chicken is still the star. It's the best fast food chicken sandwich I've ever had including Chica Filletita. Yeah you read that right Felecia. Fries are good...onion rings are almost perfect. Bonus tip: find the self serve sauce counter. In a sauce cup fill it half way with ketchup and then dump equal parts yellow mustard Sriracha and Tabasco until you fill it up. Dunk your fries in this and eat till you puke. And by fries I mean the fried potatoes not your penis. You're welcome.If you would rather kill yourself then trek here for their tasty morsels hit up the one on 23rd instead. Bye Felecia." u"I love Schnippers! I usually order delivery from work and it comes correct and fast. The only issue is that the delivery person almost ALWAYS goes to the wrong place even though we order at least 4 times a week. And sometimes he has a bit of an attitude about going to the wrong place. However the food is amazing and I'll always keep going back!" u"We found this place walking to our hotel and when I saw Mac and cheese-I had to try it. I wasn't sure how it would be so I ordered a small size Mac and cheese (was still decent amount) and then a sandwich. The Mac and cheese was so amazing. I ate half my sandwich and scarfed down the Mac and cheese. I was too full for the sandwhich so a homeless person got a really nice meal lolMy boyfriend got the tuna sandwhich and said it was really good. Great find!! The tables all seemed very dirty but just ask them to clean them off" u'After realizing how NYC is extremely stingy when it comes to "Birthdays" I hoped Schnippers would have been the gift to what seemed as a rarity in NYC. They had no birthday special....The one time I actually attempted to celebrate my birthday.I was very disappointed with the Mac and Cheese. With a delicious appearance the taste lacked luster. The "5 cheese" was overwhelming leaving you with a slight "pasty" meaning it is too thick. I would suggest to add more milk or even water. I prefer craft mac and cheese or even KFC\'s Church\'s Chicken. [P.s: OVER PRICED FOR SIDE MAC AND CHEESE]I will give their restaurant another chance. As for their mac and cheese it is permanently off my list.' u"The salads are good here. It's probably the only thing that I would get here now because I got food poisoning after eating the fish tacos and didn't go back for about 10 months." u'Very disappointing. I used their website for online ordering and for the 2nd consecutive time the order was incorrect. I asked for sauce on the side and did not check the bag upon pickup. Of course there was no sauce on my sandwich or on the side. In addition the bacon was burnt to a crisp. Very disorganized behind the counter and not worth the money.' u'Ah Schnipper\'s I knew this day would come I just hoped it wouldn\'t. \xa0This is the day I have to take a star away from you. \xa0After an absence of a few months I went back to have my old standby: the beet and goat cheese salad with grilled chicken. \xa0I\'ve noticed since the days when I visited regularly the entire staff has turned around. \xa0I used to recognize one or two cashiers cooks and the woman who I presumed was the manager - and they\'re all gone. \xa0Now I almost wrote this review two days ago - but I wanted to go back for one more visit today and make sure I gave it a fair shake and I\'m glad I did but I\'m still dropping a star. \xa0Here\'s why:Back when this branch first opened and for years after I ordered this salad constantly. \xa0It is a delicious mixture of sweet salty and crunchy. \xa0Once upon a time the salad used to come with slices of bread then for a while it was pita slices then later it went back to multi-grain style bread. \xa0You would get plenty of chicken so much so that almost every bite of the salad would include a bite of juicy chicken. \xa0Now? \xa0Not so much. \xa0The bread is gone. \xa0I thought this may have been an accident two days ago but nope - after ordering today there was no bread once again. \xa0Also the other day the piece of chicken I get was precut into about six slivers of chicken. \xa0It was flattened and really blackened and dry. \xa0Now I enjoy a good grilled piece of meat so I didn\'t mind the smokey flavor but there was so *little* chicken I was shocked. \xa0Today I received a few more bits of chicken but it was still nowhere near as much as they used to give and the chicken was again flatened burnt on the edges and not very juicy.Here\'s the thing - the food still *tastes* great but you\'re definitely getting less bang for your buck than before. \xa0I find this very unfortunate since the salad isn\'t exactly cheap.On an "atmosphere" note I don\'t know what audience the place is catering to nowadays but the music was cranked up LOUD today. \xa0I was trying to listen to a podcast with my earphones and the music was so loud I couldn\'t hear it. \xa0The group of six people next to me were practically yelling at each other across the table. \xa0It was really quite annoying.I am not giving up on the Schnip. \xa0The food is still good I enjoy the layout and drinks. \xa0I just hope perhaps things will get better on the next staff turnaround.' u"I ordered online and never received my food...after 2 hours...after calling 3 times. Then I requested a refund and didn't receive it. I'll never order from them again." u"The location is pretty large though being near Time Square across the street from Port Authority and in the NYT building it can still get crowded. They have a wide selection to choose from and ... that's about all I have to say. The food is alright nothing amazing. The milkshakes are pretty good. I normally get the breaded chicken sandwich. I only go if I'm at port authority and just want to grab a quick and easy meal or if my office is ordering from there." u"I ordered through Seamless with a 45-55 min delivery estimate and it took One Hour And 40 min to receive my food! How can you justify charging customers an added delivery fee when you don't deliver on time and have rude customer service when I call and inquire where my food is!? If you can't get the food out faster because you only have 2 delivery guys then time it so that it comes out of the kitchen when they come back to the restaurant and adjust the wait time on seamless. You completely failed at managing expectations here!And the quality of the food when it arrived was just disgusting! Ew... Greasy cold and over 40 min late! Soggy little burgers and cold fries. I could have gotten a better salad from 7 Eleven. Overpriced for what you are getting. There are so many options in Midtown seriously there is no reason to bother with this tourist trap. \xa0I submitted photos of my order: 2 classic cheeseburgers on wheat buns French fries and a Caesar salad." u"Great alternative for Shake shack's long lines!And it's located right across the park 2 min walk from Madison Sq subway station.They have a great variety of american food on the menu burgers fried chicken classic sandwiches mac and cheese salads and even tacos!I had the hamburger with all the toppings and sweet potato fries on the side! Looooved it! Soft buns patty was perfectly cooked and not at all oily! I was so happy to order the fries since they are hard to find! And I was very pleased that they were crunchie and sweet just the way I like it! \xa0Next time though I will order the Schnipper classic! I got a bite from my mom's and it was really good the bacon was delicious and perfectly combined with the arugula and house sauce! And the shakes also looked very good!Definitely going back!" u'I have been to Schnippers a few times but it has been a while. \xa0Although most lunch eateries in the Port Authority/Times Square area are tourist traps and overpriced this place stil nails it. \xa0They have a wide selection of food from the hearty fried goodies to tasty salads. \xa0They even have beer and wine. \xa0I especially appreciate that they have table turner wipes to wipe tables especially during the busy lunch rush when all the workers are diligently completing other thasks such as sendin food out to the table. \xa0I enjoyed a salad with grilled chicken and an order of sweet potato fries (although I am not a fan of maple dipping sauce) and everyone else at the table enjoyed a quick lunch bite from fish tacos to the fried chicken sandwich and onion rings. \xa0It also seemed like a good place to have deliver if you really cannot get away from work.I will definitely return for a lunch date in the near future.' u"Hello my old and wonderful friend. So many nights you've saved my life when I wanted comfort food.Burgers - amazing almost as good as shake shack. I think it has something to do with that sauce.Shakes - Peanutbutter & chocolate is my favorite. Sometimes I even request more peanutbutter than chocolate and the employees always happily make the change. Sweet potato fries pretty good. Not amazeballs but i like them and usually order them and dip in that sweet sauce.Suggestion: I'd love to see better packaging as when I take the food to go the cardboard boxes and paper bags get greased through and a lot of the flavor that i love is gone =(" u"I'm absolutely a fan of Schnipper's. They have such a huge array of American food: burgers salads fries milkshakes other yummy desserts. This place is really large so there is a ton of seating available. It is in Times Square so my guess is it sometimes gets really busy.Anyway you order and then you grab a seat and they bring you your food. no tipping required. It has that nice sit down restaurant feel without being bothered by a server. This is definitely a place I would go again!"]
5.Margon,[u"One of the best Cuban cuisine in the city. It's a hole in the wall place but a great spot if you're working or just around the Time Square area. There are two lines in the afternoon. One for their famous Cuban Sandwich in the front and another line all the way in the back for the other meals. The lines can be intimidatingly long but they actually go by quickly and all the staff are friendly.The Cubano (Cuban Sandwich $10) is smothered with mustard topped with pickles for a zing and brightness piled with ham and grilled to perfection. The bread is crunchy the whole sandwich is ooey gooey from the cheese. You can't possibly eat it classy. I'm just saying guys not the best first date option. The Cuban Coffee (Cafe Con Leche $2) is a shot of cuban espresso with steamed milk a heaping spoonful of sugar and cinnamon powder. It's served piping hot and taste as if you just received the biggest hug. \xa0Great for the winter or a cold office in the summer ;). They accept card which is a plus just don't expect fine dining or Instagram worthy photos. Just an authentic spot that serves up tasty food." u"Hot crowded and fast moving. Know what you want before you walk in service is quick and there's nowhere to stand while you look at the menu. But damn if it wasn't the best cubano I've ever had. Stood at the counter as people squeezed by everyone who left complimented the cook at the plancha. \xa0Protip: go with a friend one get in line and order one get a seat." u"Authentic food. \xa0Great \xa0friendly staff. \xa0Everyone speaks English. \xa0We had:Baked chicken Cubano Baked chuleta The food is well prepared. Most meals come with rice beans and maduros. No white meat chicken available (fried chunks and rotisserie) Prices are reasonable. \xa0Beer available. Decent spot. Not as small as I expected. Note of you dime in you'll have to squeeze in between a tight space to slide into your seat if the adjacent tables are occupied. Look for Giovanny. He is super yummy." u"If I could give this 10 stars I would.I came here at around 4:45 on a Monday afternoon based on yelp reviews and my constant hunger for Cuban comfort food. I'm not sure if it was because it was close to their lunch closing time (5pm) or the fact that I told the server how much I love this cuisine but I got a heaping generous portion of oxtail stew with rice and beans and the meal was close to perfection and easily one of the more affordable meals in NYC. If I lived closer to this place I would probably go every other day which would be deadly. It will certainly be my go-to whenever I'm craving Caribbean food!" u"It sucks I'm nowhere near this restaurant for lunchtime since it's the perfect afternoon meal. Old-school deli feel with amazing staff and hot food abound.Lots of your Cuban/Dominican favorites buffet-style or made to order. Settled on the Roast Pork sandwich combo which comes with rice and beans plantains and a fried chicken bite ($10ish). Rice and beans are your standard fare fine with hot sauce Plantains are sweet a welcome balance against the rice. Chicken is a bit hard but satiating while waiting for the main course. Pork sandwich is surprisingly flavorful with just the right ratio of bread to meat. Wish there was cheese inside to really complement the dish. Shredded potato chips on top to really make you full.For a hole-in-the-wall the service here is super friendly. I was expecting a gruff NY greeting; instead got plenty of smiles and thanks. Value here is tremendous and plenty of options to keep coming back." u"I have yet to try Margon for lunch and dinner but their breakfast can't be beat. Sometimes I'm craving a nice omelette for breakfast when I'm at work and my only options are endless ready to go breakfast sandwiches and pastries. Margon makes awesome breakfast take out meals for a great price. I've had both the western omelette and the Mangu con huevo Frito. Both are amazing. I also love their Cuban coffee. From the outside you can very well pass Margon and miss it so keep your eyes open because this is a great midtown gem." u'My recommendation: Make time to go there.Ok so if you are not looking you will miss it. Literally looks like a hole in the wall but we all know they usually have the best food and Margon is on that list. I went look for Cafe Con Leche and found and amazing lamb special and came back for the fantastic Cubano sandwich. My next tript to NYC I will make sure to go back for the oxtail. So good!!!' u'This CUBAN SANDWICH hits the spot! I\'ve been wanting to find Cuban after watching the movie "Chef" with Jon Favereau. You don\'t have to chase a food truck to get this Cuban sandwich.Smack in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Time Square. You might get stuck behind some slow walkers and have to dodge a couple tourists to get here but it\'s worth it! I only came in here for a quick bite for lunch. The restaurant itself is railroad style. The deli and goods on the left tables and seating on the right.The lowdown on the Cuban sandwich: The bread was perfect to sink your teeth into. Pickled and vinegary parts complemented thinly sliced pieces of \xa0meat. You can tell this sandwich has been flattened under a sandwich press. This way it\'s easier it is to fit into our mouths. This was my first Cuban sandwich experience but I think it might be hard to top this one. I bet this sandwich taste marvelous after a night out.Must go back to try more!' u"REAL TIME LUNCH REVIEW Y'ALL!Ordered up lunches for two days: pepper steak w/yellow rice and black beans....and palomilla steak with white rice and red beans. \xa0Order confirmed at 3pm. \xa0They're about two aves and six blocks from me. \xa0Arrived by 3:45 via a very friendly and patient delivery guy!I like that they pack the protein separate from the rice/beans/sides...and REALLY awesome that they top the rice/beans with some bonus plantains (which were SUPER good!). \xa0Don't like that everything is squished and leaning....but for food this good? \xa0Really don't care!That Palomilla Steak is what's ON! \xa0Marinated in garlic and lime. \xa0Just lovely way to do skirt steak! \xa0A bit chewy/grizzly....but nothing to really complain about at this price point.I'LL BE BACK!!!!!" u"I decided to try the Cuban sandwich from here after seeing all the great reviews. The sandwich itself was pretty good but I didn't like the bread that came with it. Also it says it is supposed to come with 16 oz rice and beans and instead it was a small plate of rice. It is a hole in a wall so definitely don't recommend it on a date." u"At $8 the cuban sandwich here hits the spot but is barely just enough for a lunch portion. Although very well executed Margon puts just one thin slice of each type of meat... There were also only 2 pickles in the whole sandwich. Don't know who you're trying to fool (probably tourists in Times Square) but come on Margon - you can do better.I think there's much better lunch deals at other spots in midtown. But if you must have Cuban perhaps the specials (see menu uploaded below) will bring better value." u'La comida esta mui rico! Gringa Spanish for amazing food. I got the Cubano and it was mouth watering (10 bucks). Great atmosphere and unbeatableTimes Square prices. Nice woman working the counter threw in some chicken wings and platanos for free!' u'Not many authentic spanish restaurants in this area therefore thisbplace is a GEM. The staff is friendly & efficient (small place & can get realllllyyy busy during lunch). Everything is yummy here and i especially enjoy there fresh made pastellis.' u'Really good and really cheap food in the heart of Manhattan! We went as a group for lunch from the training class we are taking close by.' u'Outstanding Cuban food. I had the roasted chicken and it was perfect. Be sure to check the menu before going. The specials change daily and if you have a favorite like roast pork it might only be offered once a week.The place is small and the staff keeps customers moving to allow everyone to get service. The seating area is small so most take their food to go.Very worth the experience' u"I've had this place bookmarked forever to try their Cuban sandwich. \xa0I came after a conference at the Marriott Marquis it's a short walk on the way back to Grand Central. \xa0Tiny place only a couple tables to eat at. \xa0The woman helping us couldn't have been nicer she gave my party of 3 multiple samples of the chicken wings and later the tropical shakes. \xa0We all got cubans with rice/beans. \xa0So much food for $9! \xa0The Cuban had salami on it which was different but really good. \xa0One of the better Cuban sandwiches I've had for sure. \xa0Check this place out for a cheap lunch/dinner!" u"Another restaurant checked off from my girlfriend's must try near my office lunch spots. First off I've not the type to go out of my way and order Spanish food so this was one of my first experiences. As recommended I went with the Cubano sandwich. While the sandwich was a bit smaller than expected it was still delicious. The highlight of the sandwich though was the bread. It was so crispy that I can only imagine my girlfriend squealing with each bite if she had eaten this sandwich with me (she's a huge bread lover and absolutely would have bread as her last meal). Luckily for me my sandwich was literally fresh off the grill as they tend to grill / toast several sandwiches at a time.Don't be intimidated by the lines - the service here is very streamlined as there's separate lines for sandwiches (sandwiches are at the front) and the hot plated food (rice platters). The hot plated food line was longer than the sandwich line but given how great my Cuban sandwich was I'll be back to try their hot food. There's daily specials everyday so you can eat a different dish here everyday if you wish." u"This place brings me back to my childhood. It's very hard to find Puerto Rican cuisine in the city but I think that Cuban comes close. Not a beautiful place in the sense of decor but definitely a beautiful place for your stomach. Affordable delicious food half buffet style half made to order. Cuban sandwich is a must try. Not the beast I've ever had but comes pretty damn close. Service is fast and friendly." u"In my search for Margon I walked right by the front door. Once inside and after ordering a succulent and toasty Cuban sandwich sat on the table before me. I unwrapped one end and began my culinary exploration. Being in NYC it's so easy to gulp everything down in one bite but I held back to savor every single morsel.Overall? Great sandwich and a nice little spot to take a break. I'll be back." u'After seeing a fellow Yelper Victoria S. posting a picture of her Cubano Sandwich and it looks pretty legit. Thank you again sweetie! Finally crossed Margon off my list to try =) Its a small long narrowed restaurant and pretty packed by the time that I arrived. The front of the restaurant is the sandwich station then register but you line up towards back of the house to order your food. When it was my turn "mama" only wanted the Cubano Sandwich in my belly. I ordered and get a post-it from the lady then I paid $8.70 and was handed a brown bag indicating 1P (coding for take-out). The sandwich station guy put my Cubano in the bag then I speed walk back to my office to devour this baby! Estimate time going there and heading back is 30 mins which I can\'t do all the time probably once in a blue moon ::wink::Cubano oh baby you are a carnivores\' perfect sandwich! The bread was toasted to perfection and stack of meat *drools* "mama effing love you"!']
139.West End Bar & Grill,[u"Cool bar atmosphere was good since it wasn't crowded. Definitely a place you can sit and talk. The Sriracha Honey wings are really bomb! Would come back! Kaylie (hope I spelled that right) was cool and friendly. That's the waitress I definitely recommend asking for." u"Went here for brunch before seeing he Book of Mormon matin\xe9e yesterday. I had the brunch menu burger and a Bloody Mary--so good!I got the Bloody Mary mild and it still had a nice kick to it (I'd recommend getting it mild since it was still pretty spicy my waitress told me I could always add more Tabasco if I wanted!) the burst was melt in your mouth delicious. I will definitely be back. $25 for a burger and Bloody Mary isn't bad--especially in the area." u"Always delicious brunch with fast and friendly service! Try the Veggie Scramble or the Farmers Plate and don't forget the applewood smoked bacon!" u'Such a cozzy yet elegant and modern place. The food was delicious and drinks as well. Service was good. The lighting was dim which made it that much cozzier.' u"After went around the city all day long my hubby and I was just feeling tired and hungry we were just try to find a nice place to have a great dinner together We saw this place on the way the place looked pretty great so we dicided give it a try. Once we walked in we got serve at once even the bar was quite full. It didn't took long the waitress got a seat. The bar inside also looked great it got a really nice atmosphere.So we were in the mood to tried out some local favorite drinks here we asked the waitress to recommended some to us. which she did. I actually forgot the name of my beer already but it was great. it tasted a bit like jasmine in it kinda of interested and refresching. Well My phubby he didn't like the one he got so much. The food I was really surprised and glad that actually offered food as well. And most of them did look promising on the menu. I ordered a sandwich with shrimps. It tasted amazing I really enjoyed it. so did my hubby he enjoyed his order as well. The price of this place was quite alright not supre expensive or something. I'm just glad that we came to this place it was a lovely night." u'Best place in New York by far!!!! Been here twice and both times were unforgettable great service great food... Absolutely a must for every person who visits New York' u"Pat Lafrieda burger on the menu? YES PLEASE !folks do yourself a favor and skip the shake shack down the block & order nothing but the Pat Lafrieda burger! no joke one of the juciest best tasting burgers i have ever had (and ive had my fare share of them!). Although the bun seemed like it was a little too small for the patty the meat was so just so tasty & flavorful that im drooling in my seat just thinking about that yummy burger right now! With each bite the juices just dripped all over the plate so make sure to have your napkins ready!I ordered mines w/Gruyere cheese & a portabella mushroom and damn was the perfect combination. looking back i should have ordered a 2nd one but i didn't want to look like a complete fat ass in front of my friends. Next time im in town i know where im getting my next burger! YUM !!!!" u"The bar is convenient and is located literally right next to the subway line. We were able to make reservations on a Saturday night and the staff was very friendly. The atmosphere is pretty much what you'd expect at a bar with televisions if you are looking to catch a game.The food was tasty however I must warn you that the portions are very small. I'm not necessarily a big eater but I felt that they were small for the price tag. The salmon entree was $26 and the skirt steak salad was $17. If you're looking for a good amount of food at a reasonable price then you might want to try another place." u'This is a really good spot to stop by if yur in the area and looking for food & drinks. \xa0It was pretty packed at the bar when i came in it was pretty packed at the bar so I asked the waitress for a table and was seated immediatly. \xa0My waitress was very nice and gave me a recommendation on a drink that I forgot the name of but it was oh so delicious and came with sugared fruit on a stick. \xa0Also when checking into yelp you get w free glass of wine so that was also a plus. \xa0I got to meet the owner who at first I thought was a patrin at the bar because some drunk guy just came over snd was like "do u know this man?!" no sir i do not and that was then the owner introduced himself and explained who he was. \xa0He was very nice laid back and down to earth! who woulda known?!For my entree I ordered the burger and it was perfect with the add ons of cheddar cheese and bacon. \xa0The burer was perfectly cooked (medium as requested) and the bun supported the meat which is not a thin little patty. \xa0The fries were seasoned perfectly!! This ws my second time here and I will deffinitly return!' u'Inexpensive and great food!I had the sangria which was delicious.My girlfriend got the vegetable quesadillas & I got the steak salad and added avocado.Very fairly priced friendly service and left completely satisfied =)' u'Stopped by after a show and had absolutely wonderful service. \xa0Drinks were good and food of a very good quality but our visit was made by our server Alison. \xa0From the moment she came over she was incredibly funny and very personable. \xa0Anything we needed was done virtually before we asked. \xa0I could not have asked for a better server!!' u'Best bar in the Times Square area! Great bartenders good prices nice ambiance relaxed games speakeasy music good food' u"One of the worst experiences I've ever had. We tried to go here for breakfast this morning. We ordered coffee eggs and an omelet. The coffee was delivered to our table but not milk/cream or sugar. We asked the waitress and she only brought over cream. She also asked my husband what type of eggs he wanted again and if he wanted toast. If she'd written down the order she might not have needed to. After waiting awhile for sugar my husband went to the bar and our waitress said she'd bring it over. I decided to have my coffee anyways and when I picked up my cup there was a giant hair under the mug. We threw down some cash and left. I've never done that before but had just had enough of this place. You can't even get a coffee order right and then there's hair? Don't waste your time or money on this place." u'A good place to have a drink but not to eat. We were underwhelmed by the crab cakes a mediocre plate at best. The short rib spring rolls were hardly edible dense oily and undersealed. Not to mention all food is overpriced.' u"We stopped in for a drink after seeing Wicked. \xa0It wasn't bad. \xa0The Toasted Coconut drink was pretty tasty. \xa0The corned beef sliders weren't bad either." u"Had some time to kill before a show and this was one of the first places that wasn't insanely crowded. \xa0We were sat immediately and began looking over the menu. \xa0Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive without being overbearing. \xa0We ordered a couple of sandwiches and the cheese plate. \xa0The cheese plate was a bit of a throw away for me but seems to be a trend that is here to stay. \xa0Don't get me wrong I really enjoy a well thought out cheese plate but when you can't explain to me what the differences are or don't identify the cheese when it's placed in front of me you might as well just have brought me queso. \xa0The sandwiches were really good. \xa0We had a cheesesteak and a chicken sandwich and both were cooked well and tasted just fine. \xa0Prices were reasonable for the area and for NYC. \xa0Be warned that as we were leaving the place got VERY crowded and the minute we stood up our table was taken so either make a reservation or come in a bit earlier." u'I stopped in for a quick lunch with some friends from out of town who had just seen Wicked. The three of us were seated immediately and after our drinks arrived we ordered. We all ordered the Pat LaFrieda hand packed burger with fries. It was an awesome tasting burger-we all agreed. Our waitress Joanna F. was most accommodating and came by several times to see if everything was alright and if we needed anything else. The decor is publike and is a very comfortable setting. The burgers came with lettuce tomato and onion and each of us got a different choice of cheese [I got American they both got Monterey Jack] It was an excellent meat and a wonderful night out. I would recommend and return.' u"Didn't eat but had drinks. Cool atmosphere. We actually sat outside. \xa0Would definitely go back to try their good looking menu!" u'Today I came with a party of 11 for brunch/lunch. The food was good. The service was NOT. They sat our party in the back which was fine however the table next to us dropped their drinks twice. The second time the drinks splashed on us. Our waitress did not come over to check on us or to apologize. We arrived at 12:30pm the food did not arrive in its entirety until 2pm. The food came out in parts by one of the kitchen staff. He was kind even though we had to send some of the orders back for not being cooked thoroughly and had to ask him for other items since our waitress was not present. We asked to speak with a manager and they told us that she has stepped and did not know when she would be back. The overall experience was horrible the rating would have been a 1 but the food was good so I gave it a 2.' u"This place is super close to Times Square just a few blocks up and to the left. We went at 6 pm tonight (Wednesday night) and there was a good crowd in there but we didn't have to wait for a table.Pros:The staff is very friendlyFree beer with check in on yelp (limited selection)Tuna tartare with avocado was killerSliders were very good as wellCons: menu was in pretty small... I had a tough time deciding what to get because nothing truly jumped out at me but was happy with the sliders I gotOverall the dishes we got were around $15 each (appetizers and one pumpkin ravioli). It was good food and nice atmosphere but nothing too memorable here."]
29.Nippori,[u"Decent ramen for Times Square area. I ordered the tan tan ramen and it was very bold and flavorful. I didn't like that there was not char siu but ground pork instead. The best part about this place is checking in on Yelp and getting a free Kirin Beer!!" u"I don't get it! The reviews here are so good! Came here for a work lunch on a Thursday and ordered the Maki Sushi platter. On a extremely hot summer day many of us felt like trying a cooler option - sushi! One of my colleagues however did get the tan tan ramen. The rice of the sushi was way too dry...and extremely salty too for some reason. It came with a miso soup and a salad. The miso soup was decent but only had one piece of tofu...the rest was all broth! The salad was a classic house salad with vinaigrette dressing. The service was quick and the staff seemed friendly. Have to give them that! The ambience was contemporary and modern but the tables were very close together so can feel a little cramped. The do have private booths that they reserve for 6 people or more which looked nicer but still a very tight space.I would maybe come back here to try the Ramen and hopefully that will live up to all the great yelp reviews!" u"This review is purely for the food. The service was good as they tried their best to accommodate everyone during Thursday night dinner. I had a comedy club show to catch with my boyfriend around the corner and I was surprised I was in and out of the place in time.We both ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and the fried tofu with eggplant appetizer. The food came out quick but that led to me thinking why that impacted the food's taste.The fried tofu was served in a bowl of soy sauce with fried eggplants on top. I thought the tofu looked odd and my boyfriend pointed that out as well. I thought the tofu was underfried and we gave it a chance. I was highly upset as this tofu's exterior texture was just a sticky jelly-like cornstarch. It was as if the tofu wasn't fried at all.The ramen was disappointing as well as the broth had an odd milky consistency with a peanut or sesame-type taste. The noodles were al dente. The only reason I came in was to catch a meal before the show after I had snacked on a matcha cream puff at Bubble & Sip. I was glad I had something enjoyable. I would not eat here again." u"Of course we came here after seeing Wicked (right across the street) because of the Yelp reviews. And of course Yelp saved the night. The hubs and i were pretty weary because Yelp showed only two $ signs for a place so close to Broadway. Immediately after checking in and getting our complimentary beer we were put at ease. The ambiance was dark and low key. I could barely see the food and had to use my cellphone flash (sorry folks at the next table!). There were even some private dining booths by the entrance.We ordered a bunch of things: Kara age Kani Salad a bottle of sake Chirashi and and a spicy ramen. Everything was surprisingly good. The kara age for the price we paid was the clear winner. If it were closer to where I worked I'd come here to binge on it and beer at their bar. Everything else was also good. Not the best but great for the price we paid. Definitely a keeper!" u"4-4.5 stars. Very solid izakaya-style Japanese joint in Midtown West. We went on a Wednesday night around 9 pm for a late dinner and there were a few people scattered about in the restaurant. We ordered the steamed pork belly buns grilled saba and katsu curry. We were also going to order some spare ribs but at that point I asked our waiter if he thought we had ordered enough and he responded by saying we should probably wait to see if we needed the extra dish. That is the hallmark of good service!!! I have been to so many other places where we way over ordered at the urging of the waiter/waitress. The pork buns were soft and juicy and had just enough sauce to add a sweet and salty flavor that didn't overwhelm. I really liked the grilled saba-it was very meaty not too dry and very savory. Finally the katsu curry was also on point-it wasn't overly salty unlike some other Japanese curry I've had. Overall a great experience!" u"I'll make it short an simple. \xa0Not sure why the ratings are so high in the reviews.Service- 2 stars. \xa0Got seated with no menus. \xa0Had to flag down wait staff at times. \xa0No check back on food. \xa0No refill on water until we ask for the bill that tells you.Food - 3 stars. \xa0Fried oysters were big because of the batter. \xa0I ordered ramen as there were nothing wow on the menu. \xa0Ramen were good probably high in sodium. \xa0Decor - 3 was nice dark but not intimate (tables right next to each other) \xa0so why so dark.So again \xa0??? On the reviews by others." u"I came to Nippori for some ramen because i heard good things about the food from a friend. It is a small but very cozy place. We were seated very quick and our order was taken promptly. I food came out very quick and was exactly as we ordered it. It should be noted that the price is very very reasonable. Nippori is a great alternative if other ramen spots are busy. \xa0I would highly recommend Nippori to anyone looking for a good bowl of ramen.I would rate Nippori as follows: Ramen is 3.5 Stars Price is 4 Stars Service is 4.5 Stars and Atmosphere is 4 Stars.The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment." u"Finally ... I tried a bowl of ramen at Nippori. \xa0Went solo for lunch during weekday. \xa0Restaurant was packed but a benefit of dining solo is .. available seats at the bar. \xa0I immediately went to Ramen section on the menu. \xa0Ordered myself a bowl of Tan Tan ramen with a rice bowl of Gyu Don for extra 5 bucks. \xa0Yes .. I was greedy wanted to eat everything. \xa0Food arrived quickly. \xa0Delicious broth! \xa0But it wasn't as spicy as others had claimed. \xa0Gyu Don was okay. \xa0Slightly dried. \xa0I had better. \xa0All in all it was a pleasant experience. \xa0I would go back and try other ramen they have to offer." u"I found this place awhile ago when I was searching for ramen places in the city. The menu looks decent and bookmarked this place for quite some time. I was around the area and came here for dinner with my friend yesterday.The place wasn't busy at all for a Sunday evening and we were seated right away. I got the Tonkotsu ramen and it was kinda interesting since they put pickled cabbage in it. Never had that in my ramen before. I though that the charsu pork was too small but at least it was tender. Overall solid bowl of ramen and I really liked it. I also got to taste my friend's Gyuu ramen and it has thinly sliced beef poached egg onions pickled ginger. I didn't like it since it was SO SALTY and I probably won't order it when I come back next time.Service was good and they didn't rush us out to leave. The food came out in a timely manner. Good location. It's near the 50th street subway stop [ACE lines] and a few Broadway show theaters. I'll probably try the Tan tan men or the Nippori ramen when I visit again next time.NOTE: Free beer with Yelp check-in" u"Enjoyed the sushi and ramen that we had. Full of flavor and very fresh. Wish there were more speciality roll options for sushi. I wasn't blow away. The ramen however was fantastic! The atmosphere was nice and the service was average." u'Salty and super salty. This place is not safe for people with high blood pressure and be prepare to drink a lot of water. Food - 1.5/5Value - 2/5Space - 3/5Decor - 3/5Service - 3/5Bathroom - 3/5We ordered the gyuu don (fatty beef over rice) and the beef hotpot with glass noodle both were super salty and almost inedible. My friend had to pour and mixed in his glass of water with the noodle soup to make it okay to eat - now if you can just imagine! My whole tongue and month felt itchy and a burning sensation during the meal. We came for a late lunch so there were maybe 1 or 2 other person eating or "chilling" by the counter. Not sure if the main chef was taking a nap somewhere else or something but the quality of food was most upsetting. Our waiter / waitress didn\'t get the cue that I had only ate barely half of the meal and didn\'t even bother to ask how we\'re doing despite my less-than-pleased face. I will never come back since there are so many other good authentic Japanese shop around this area (hello totto ramen) food was terrible service was meh stay away!' u"I have to start by saying that the food I tried was delightful and the only reason why I'm giving the three star rating is that we happened to have experienced subpar customer service. The waitress that first served us was really great she helped me make the final decision to get the grilled salmon dish which comes with rice and miso soup for an extra 2 dollars. I also enjoyed getting my free yelp check in beer but was pretty bummed it took nearly 10 minutes to be served and was warm... Definitely NOT the way beer should be served! My best friend asked if the ramen can be made vegetarian and they brought her a tasteless soup with noodles.My salmon however was cooked tender with soy ginger and garlic flavor and some ramen noodles that had the same delicious flavor. I found it strange that the miso soup did not come as an appetizer and was rather served with the dish. It was tasty regardless. Our meals took about twenty minutes to arrive and we never had anyone check on us to see if we needed anything. My friend had to go over to someone to ask for the check and then again to pay the bill. If you are a patient person they do have a good happy hour 5 dollar wines and some mixed drinks until 7PM. Hopefully they can do something about the service and don't order a vegetarian dish not on the menu like my friend did you would be disappointed." u"The ramen was good. I got the Nippori Ramen and the broth was delicious. I wish it came with veggies though because having ramen with only straight up noodle is just not a pretty dish (needs colors!! a personal preference though). When I asked if my ramen could come with some veggies they said sure but didn't tell me it would cost $4 extra for some carrots and snow peas. They should tell you how much extra its gonna cost. I asked before they added it so I cancelled the addition of vegetables but still they should always say the added value to your meal especially if its something that steep! The server here was nice but it was really slow. Extremely slow" u'Soothing Japanese place a few blocks away from the hustling bustling TS.Their seating is not cramped up and seems spacious enough for large parties. We were given our menus immediately and the waiter brought the water promptly. We had ramen on our radar and wanted to do justice to the hot ramen. It seemed like an ideal choice given the fact that it was raining and thunderstorm outside. My idea of a spicy and hot ramen is red spiced broth which leaves you with a burst of flavors in your mouth and leaves you wanting many more sluuurping seconds. I had the intention of cutting the ramen heat with the seaweed salad but unfortunately the seaweed salad never made its way to our table. I am taking a point out or that.Anyways the ramen did complete justice. Broth was very well seasoned and tasty. I added some fried garlic and egg on it and oh boy it was amazing..Another ramen that we tried was with coconut milk. This particular one was very mild and seemed soothing. Would imagine this broth to taste good if it was cold sobo. But anyhow we enjoyed our meal here and the time was well spent.' u"Oh my Tan Tan Men (award winning ramen)!! I might have just drooled a little writing this review. \xa0This ramen spot is nestled in the midst of the more notable NYC ramen spots but guess what? no lines! We came here around 9pm on a Thursday night and were seated instantly. \xa0The staff are great! They make sure you're taken care of and do double checks for food allergies. The food is delicious I highly recommend the tan tan men and shishito peppers! Also be sure to check in on Yelp for that free Beer! If you're not about waiting in lines and want a solid bowl of ramen free beer great service and great ambiance then stop in here! Enjoy!" u"I don't get it. The reviews on here are so good!I ordered the ramen and I agree with reviewers that the portions are large. But WOW the broth was so incredibly salty. Everything else about the ramen (noodles meat veggies) were on point and even the broth flavor was good! But just a few handfuls oversalted." u'Very good chef selection sushi decent beer selectionThe ramen was very similar to actual japanese ramen in Japan although the soyu based one I had was a little sweeter than traditional soyu ramen. 65uss for one app 2 ent 2 beers.' u"As some may already know Nippori is run by the same folks that own Tabata the excellent ramen chain in Hell's Kitchen. The difference here is that you'll find a larger menu most notably the addition of sushi and a larger appetizer menu. Another observation is that most of the appetizers seem to be a buck or two more. Nippori is conveniently located on 51st Street between 7th and 8th Avenues. We arrived at around 5:45 p.m. on a workday and the restaurant noticeably got very crowded by 6:30 p.m. which I think was the theatre crowd. Nippori has a long rectangular dining room with a full bar to the right of the entrance. The seats were not too packed together so we were very comfortable in our chairs. Since I wanted to compare Nippori with their two sister Tabata restaurants my friend and I ordered ramen. She ordered the Sutamina ramen and I order the Asari ramen. What my friend and I can confirm is that both ramen bowls taste exactly the same as those in its sister Tabata restaurants. The Sutamina was a spicy miso broth with thinly sliced pork. The Asari ramen contained at least 4 to 5 short necked clams in a salt broth. I never ordered shio (salt) broth before so I was worried about it being overly salted. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too salty to drink. As an appetizer we order fried chicken wings. I believe it was about $7 and only contained two wings but they were large and were very satisfying. We really enjoyed the service at Nippori. The wait staff was attentive and very nice to us and our baby boy. In fact they went out of our way to seat us in a place where a stroller would fit. We enjoyed their genuine enthusiasm and also our chat with them. \xa0Overall for a first visit I would recommend Nippori based on the fact that Nippori hasn't forgotten its Tabata roots. The ramen is still excellent. I feel that a fuller review would include their sushi and more appetizer items but for a start I really enjoyed my experience." u"I ordered some appetizers and cold tan tan ramen actually I really loved this ramen. Definitely come back for this noodle. A little bit spicy for me but the taste was very nice. The appetizers was ok. It's like izakaya menu." u'Every ramen place has its hits and misses so lessen that I learned is that never wait outside any single ramen shop for more than 20 minutes for whatever reasons. They are all decent or at least decent per unit of time spent waiting.So our team came and visited Nippori on a cosy Friday noon. It was kind of far from where we work though. Instead of ramen each of us opted for their lunch special sukiyaki pot accompanied by a small salad and rice. For 15 dollars it was a good bargain with good taste.The only downside about this place was probably the sanity condition on the wall. One star less.']
169.The Counter,[u"They have a variety of burgers to choose from and you can also build your own! \xa0They give the option add a side of shoe string fries sweet potato fries and coleslaw for an additional cost of $3.50. \xa0Toppings are unlimited unless you order supreme toppings such as bacon and avocado then there is an extra cost. \xa0They offer pretzel buns and gluten free buns both are great options! \xa0If you choose not to have a bun you can have it on a salad. \xa0The milkshakes are awesome they give you the option to pick from one of theirs or make your own. \xa0They even have alcoholic ones! It's in a really crowded area right in Times Square and can get really busy. \xa0They don't take reservations. \xa0They play awesome music I got to listen to Beyonce during my whole mean! There is a pokestop right outside this location FYI setting up a lure is ideal lolol." u"If it wasn't for the very tasty burger meat patty itself this place would get zero stars. \xa0 \xa0I ordered kale onions tomatoes boiled egg on a medium well with cheddar cheese sauce less on a multigrain bun. \xa0 The freshest topping was the boiled egg in which I appreciated that they were slivered very slim to complement sitting in my burger without it becoming a mess. \xa0The kale was wilted slight crisp Couldn't taste the rest of the toppings. \xa0I think it's because they are so thinly sliced. \xa0The restaurant was handing out free face full of shoestring fries coupons when you order a burger and we sure got what we paid for the fries were cold and chewy. \xa0 \xa0 The sweet potato fries that we actually paid for was hot and not tasty just straight up fried batter it seems. \xa0 Although everyone was friendly and chatty the service is terrible. \xa0 There are not many tables in this restaurant yet we had to ask multiple times for beverage refills and waited for a long periods of time for those refills. \xa0 The table next to us had a good size family and we noticed that they also have to keep waving down the waitress. \xa0 \xa0OK. \xa0 The real kicker is that all the customers screamed and some women flew up off their chairs because there was a very large sized cock roach crawling on their table while they were eating. \xa0 Obviously we were done at this point lost any small amount of appetite \xa0and the manager gave everyone a %20 discount off their bills. \xa0We did appreciate her apology and the fact that she went around to ask everyone if they were ok. \xa0 But the managers wait staff sucks. \xa0 \xa0Definitely will not recommend to friends and family and colleagues and we sure as shit will not return. \xa0 We will just head to five guys if we want a burger." u'Recently I ventured through TS and through a recommendation of a friend stopped in at The Counter for lunch. This build your own burger type place didn\'t disappoint. First I was pleased with available seating and overall crowd. On a Saturday at 12:15 there were tables available for small groups more than 4 would have been a 10-15 minute wait. There was space at the small bar so I took a seat to wait for my friend to arrive. Upon asking I found that weekends are less busy than weekdays. I also enjoyed the size of the place. It wasn\'t too big at all but didn\'t feel cramped. \xa0Didn\'t feel too "touristy". The food was really really good. I ordered a bbq bacon burger asked for no tomato and added grilled onions. (Yes I then had two types of onions). The bbq sauce was thinner and a bit sweeter than I\'m used to but it was delicious. I asked for my burger medium and it was spot on. So juicy and very tasty. This was a burger where cutting it in half was a must. I ordered the 1/3 lb size which is the smallest choice. \xa0I felt like it was PLENTY big enough. One of those burger that fills you up to satisfied but not uncomfortably full. I didn\'t order the fries but my friend and I split a chili cheese fries. Presentation was good flavor was okay. I\'m not a huge fan of shoestring fries. So it was definitely a fork type dish. If I ever go back again I\'d try the sweet potato fries instead. Prices are exactly what you\'d expect in TS. 12.50 for a burger with standard toppings. \xa0My Bbq bacon burger was 15.50. Honestly- fair for the location. It was this or shake shack- and having had shack before it\'s hard to compare them. \xa0Two totally different burgers. This one is bigger more substantial and is reflected in the price. Only reason I deducted a star was because of the fries as I don\'t typically like shoe string. Burger was outstanding.' u"Don't know about all those giving this little joint subpar reviews and don't really care as I have to say during my visit here last night in the tourist hell hole known as Times Square I kind of enjoyed my meal at The Counter.Quick courteous and friendly service.Clean and nicely air conditioned.Small area with plenty of seating crammed in and some counter spots by the bar but doable overall. The high ceilings large windows and modern decor make it a chill looking spot.Many options on the menu to build your own burger have a salad bowl try different dressings mix and match and there is even a decent beer list. Shakes floats malts and even boozy shakes offered. Guy standing outside with coupons for a small order of shoestring fries for free was a nice perk too. The veggie burger here was pretty solid. Had the option to place it on an Asian Veggie salad with a grilled pineapple on top. Really good choice if eating healthy or if doing the vegan thing. Had some ginger soy vinaigrette and overall it was a tasty meal.Considering it's in Times Square the food prices are acceptable but be aware of the overinflated costs for a beer here. Can of Shiner at $8.50? Ouch! Next time I'll get a Diet Coke. Still I would come back here again if in the area as it's a nice option to have for some decent quick and healthier eats." u"While I was completely overwhelmed by the amount of options I decided any combination would be great and I was absolutely right. We had a table of 8 and got seated and served in a very timely manner. Everyone's burger had its own great version. The sweet potato fries- you have to get them. Also if you are feeling dessert you HAVE to order a shake- you get three ingredients. (Go with brownie cookie caramel)" u'As the restaurant is in Times Square it is going to be a bit "pricey" as everyone is saying and the wait might be longer than a restaurant three or four blocks down. BUT I got seated right away at the bar which was clean and the bartender was not only quick and helpful but cute too. I got a burger and fries which was very good and the fries I got free with help from Yelp! :) Oh and - Nutella Pretzel shake was amazing. I couldn\'t get enough.' u'The counter burger is definitely the way to go here even though the red eye was pretty good with the sweet siracha sauce and egg on top.Fries were delicious!!! I wish the actual meat of the burger had better flavor. The service was great everyone was so sweet pleasant and attentive.Overall everything is a bit overpriced due to the location but a good meal and experience. If for some reason you find yourself in the middle of Times Square which is basically hell this is a good place to sit back and enjoy a burger with some tourists from all over the world.' u"Best burger I have ever had for sure ! We spent a few days in NYC and had to stop by The Counter after hearing so many good things about it. So Worth it ! The weather was super bad so we spent quite a while in there the people were super nice. Our waitress was sweet and gave us good advice on what to try according to what we wanted. We had onion rings as a starter super good but it was wayyyy to much :p Lukily we shared ! We then had a burger each I took the one with chili con carne in it. Amazing but again such a big burger ! We couldn't take a desert but the milkshakes sure looked good ! The price was pretty high but the food was great the restaurant is on Time Square so super easy to find. Don't miss it if you happen to pass by !" u"The Counter is a good spot to keep in mind when in Times Square and looking for food that isn't a chain (I'm looking at you Olive Garden).We had just finished with an event at Bryant Park and wanted something quick and easy in the area. Outside there was an employee handing out vouchers for free fries. Inside is a relatively narrow spot setup much like a diner with a menu full of burger and burger salad options. Here's the fun part. You can either order a salad that they automatically pair with either a turkey beef or veggie burger. There is also a clipboard where you can pick and choose what you want. The Mediterranean salad is delicious! Greens with veggies feta and a turkey burger thrown on top. Very filling and very good. The fries are just okay but they were free so can't complain.The only reason I knocked off a star is because a can of Shiner is $8.50. That right there brings you back to reality and gives a gentle reminder that you are still in Times Square surrounded by tourists and Applebee's and Elmo wanting to give you a lap dance. Otherwise this is a solid spot if you need to escape the bright lights and annoying tourists for a bit." u'Great service. For being in time square and the restaurant being on the little side we had a great send Me off party. I created a build your own burger.. "build my own burger"... Pineapple ham lettuce tomato smokey chipotle sauce tillamock cheddar cheese and cole slaw. Free side from YELP!I also ordered a banana foster "adult" beverage! yum! This was great from the beginning to the end! Made to perfection too. Our server was great! Always checked in he was patient and very much ok with me asking a lot of questions! I loved my first and possibly last time going here! It\'s known to be a touristy spot but I actually loved my burger very much! I love the idea! Lots of places in CA check it out!!' u"**came here on a monday the start of a week after driving past here normally going to red lobsters but this place caught my eye and i knew i had to give it a try......well first off the customer service was a lil lack luster as i waited at the door for a good while-food smelled wonderful as i waited!!burgers came pound or half pound (i ordered a half pound beef gruyere cheese avo chipotle mayo saut\xe9ed mushrooms & of course bacon -was very tasty!!!all in all this place wasn't all that ball the food made it well worth iti can say i will be back again on a lunch break type set lol signedi love to eat & do it consistently out and all over & i tip wellmr.von teesexoxox" u'I have been to the counter in LA and decided to try this location as I work close by. The food basically tastes the same but the customer service is really lacking here. The servers seem inattentive and distracted.' u'I gave it 3 stars for the good food and the people watching views. However the wait was waaaaaaaaay to long. After we were seated we had to wait over 20 minutes before our orders were taken. It appears the waitresses was laughing and giggling in the corner instead of taking our orders. There was one or two waitresses that appeared to be doing their jobs however my waitress was not concerned with her customers.I dont recommend if you have less than 1.5 hours for lunch.' u'I had just eaten at the PHX location when I was in NYC for work the next week. I saw it and thought oh ya so went when my program finished. \xa0It was about 10:30pm but still pretty busy. \xa0Not badly priced for NYC. \xa0I sat at the bar as a single the service was meh the food was good . . . I ordered a sauce trio but only got two and the burger (turkey) was very charbroiled. \xa0If you are looking for a good burger at a decent price close to Times Sq go here. \xa0One day I will try the adult shakes. Enjoy!' u"Walked past this place during our visit to New York City and it looked like a nice little burger joint so we walked in. Very friendly service! I liked the concept of building your own burger and the burger was perfect with a nice brioche bun. Good shoestring fries as well. This place had tv screens with sports on it but played nice music as well. Would definately recommend this place if you're craving a good burger." u"Went here bc I was hungry and looking for a nice burger. I went in it wasn't crowded at all and I went to the bar area were the service was excellent. My bartender was very friendly and helpful. \xa0I didn't have much time so I asked how long a burger would take to come out she said 10 for medium I said perfect. \xa0I ordered a customized burger. \xa0And surprisingly 10 min later the burger came out and it was cooked to a perfect medium. \xa0It was really fast. \xa0I know it's Times Square but a $17 burger. \xa0It was way too pricey and for a burger that was ok nothing spectacular and the meat itself was way under seasoned. \xa0It will be my last time going to that burger joint." u"Service (Whopping 3 Stars): I stopped here twice in one evening; once before the 8 p.m. Lion King show for dinner and shortly after the show for dessert (not intentional). Upon arrival the place was packed so I stood to the side and waited for a seat at the bar (my favorite spot to avoid long waits). When a seat finally opened I had to ask the bartender slash server slash cashier if she could wipe my area down so that I can sit. After a quick frown she obliged (no tip for you honey). I quickly found what I wanted closed my menu and proceeded to wait for my order to be taken (after she made five milkshakes three mixed cocktails and had several conversations with her coworkers). Food (4): Veggie Club Sandwich Parmesan Fries and a Martini to wash it down with. Very delish. I ate the entire sandwich. The fries were well seasoned with the right amount of everything. My martini was really good as well. I suppose for the lack of service the bartender made up in her skill to shake a good drink. For my 2nd visit that evening I had a very thick adult milkshake....VERY VERY Good.Ambiance (4): They were quite crowded (not unusual for NYC). The seating arrangements were extremely tight which made me feel very uncomfortable. The decor was hip and welcoming. Seeing a crowd made it very inviting for the walk in.I'd give this place another try; we have one here in Phoenix which there is currently a Groupon out there for (score!)." u'The food here is delicious!!! \xa0And I love the concept of being able to pick all the ingredients you want on your burger (or in my case grilled chicken sandwich)!!! \xa0You pick the items you want off a checklist. \xa0I highly recommend a side of Parmesan fries.Restaurant was clean and food came quickly. \xa0Price was reasonable for Times Square. \xa0Only downside is that it was tiny so if you go during peak times it gets crowded fast and you may have to wait.Looking forward to eating there again next time I am in NYC.' u'Very extensive menu as you can make your own completely different burgers. As a vegetarian burger places can be very boring and quite plain however this place is a complete different story. All the staff are very friendly especially Mike who we were served by. Very impressed with the price too. All in all a very pleasant trip and probably will return before our holiday here is up.' u"Probably one of my favorite burger places in New York City. The food isn't incredibly noteworthy but it is tasty convenient and there are tons of options offered at this joint. It also doesn't hurt that the Counter is located very centrally in the middle of Manhattan and is so close to Times Square.I usually get a tuna or grass fed burger without the bun and pesto or sun dried tomato sauce. The food is fresh the options are plentiful (pineapple and arugula on a burger? Genius!) and the prices are reasonable! Love the counter!"]
33.Toloache,[u"Toloache must be the best Mexican restaurant in the city and probably the best one I ever been to. I said it last time at the other location in Thompson St. This chef is a rockstar! He really knows how to make incredible dishes with the most well known ingredients. There's nothing ecclesiastical about it. It just how is prepared and the quality of the products.Once again we went for RW since overall the place is a little bit expensive if you go in a regular day and restaurant week makes it possible to fine dine at these kind of restaurants.Everything and I mean every single thing we ordered was to die for. There were no favorites... Or maybe yes they were ALL favorites.I went with my girlfriend and we had different things so we could share and taste everything.As a starter the pork tacos (or tacos al pastor for the ones who love this bite) were probably the best ones I ever had. The tenderness of the meat and the sauce that was marinated into was just unbelievable. So fresh! As well as the shrimp ceviche tostada. You wouldn't imagine this kind of flavor coming out of a regular shrimp tostada but it was out of this world. The sesame hint and the crushed peanuts made the difference. Soooo good!Then the star of the lunch as always: the entra\xf1a (skirt steak). Wow! They know how to cook meat. It melts in your mouth. Top quality meat. And the Brussel Sprouts!! These are one of a kind. They remind me of a taste from Argentina. Those childhood memories that you feel you are in Ratatouille. Flashback and tears coming out of your eyes. I could eat a whole bucket of that Brussel sprout side.The salmon that comes over a tortilla it's very good. Not a must but good if you are already eating the entra\xf1a. If not other TWO entra\xf1as haha.Then the desserts are surprisingly amazing. The combination of flavors is to die for. There was nothing left on the plate. Nothing! If I weren't in a restaurant I would say I would lick the plate. Anyway the almond tart comes with a caramel and chocolate that is incredible and a special mention for me since I'm a coffee ice cream fan and this espresso ice cream was one of the best.The profiteroles killed it! I didn't expect this kind of taste. A cream that is almost like a crema pastelera with very delicious dough and great sauces and chocolate. Even the blackberries were awesome.Definitely my favorite place for Mexican!" u'This unique trendy Mexican restaurant in Times Square was delicious. A bit pricey for a family of 4 and they charge per soda( which is served in a small glass approx 6 ounces with ice for $3.00)When we complained about it the waiter told us "We are not aloud to tell customers that there is additional charges for refills ". That is a direct quote...This is why they are getting only 3 stars.The food was amazing I must say! Guacamole was perfect! Chicken tacos and chicken Quesadillas were succulent! I wish I could give more stars but we felt like the wait staff was lacking....and in a city saturated with restaurants customer service is important!' u"My brother recommended this restaurant and while the food was good the service was not what I would call hospitable. The space is rather cramped and the managers kept walking up and down looking for empty tables to fill while the servers tried to rush patrons through their meal to add another body in their seat. On the other hand if you're limited for time you might appreciate this approach.It is noisy as all get out and not the place for conversation. I thought I would become hoarse after an evening of raised voice.Wait staff were always upselling for every item ordered from the menu.We ordered the lobster tacos (the best!) carne asada tacos (ordinary) fried Brussels sprouts with queso fresco (love it!) ripe plantains (always a favorite) spicy kale (nice alternative and flan (comfort food).There is lots of competition in NYC and we'll try another which offers delicious food as well as welcoming hospitality." u'What really bugs me is the lack of insect options in this big beautiful city of ours but not here baby! Come and get you Grasshopper on and wash it down with a margarita ( you may have to lol).I\'m always on the look out for unusual and or unique cuisine options. In celebration of Cinco de mayo I was thrilled to see "Grasshopper" on the menu baby! I come from a mind set that believes if someone or culture chooses to eat it then why shouldn\'t I. I\'ve had the opportunity to consume several different types of insects in my life including live grubs and scorpion but never cooked grasshopper. Slightly crunchy seasoned with a hint of heat and just a little moist within the exoskeleton. Yummy for my tummy. I enjoyed the earthy grassy taste my inner neanderthal felt quenched for my desire for the bizarre oh how proud Andrew Zimmern would be of me.We sampled many other guacamole and queso options all scored high marks as did the beef pork chicken and beef tacos. Strangely they didn\'t offer tongue head cheese or tripe? Portions seemed average to smaller but acceptable.The Margarita\'s were satisfying I pounded two jalape\xf1os drinks I will not be denied my need for heat.Yes nice decor yes good food yes good drinks at reasonable prices in the bustling Time square area. For me it\'s all about the Grasshopper.' u"Jesus eating in NYC is mad expensive... I'm used to my $1-2 tacos so I was only okay eating here because it was covered by the company. This place was packed for the evening rush but they were super accommodating with getting us a table for two. Started off with chips followed by the atun ceviche and the lechon and carne asada tacos. The ceviche was fresh and yummy but the watermelon didn't work well with it texturally. The tacos were flavorful but not $7 a taco flavorful. We had churros for dessert and they were warm and crunchy with good dipping sauces. Good food busy vibes and high prices." u"Loved this place. Amazing service and it's definitely well \xa0managed. Wait time wasn't too bad on a Wednesday. Sat downstairs which sucked because upstairs looked swankier. Other than that it was smooth sailing. Oh wait no I forgot their appetizer off the restaurant week menu with watermelon was disgusting. Worst appetizer I ever had . But I did order a side of guacamole that came with what looked like a tomato soup and also a bowl of tortilla chips. The soup was not necessary and masked the amazing flavors of the guacamole .The entrees I tried were the black cod off their dinner menu and the split roasted crispy chicken off the restaurant week menu. Both were torn up relatively quickly. The cod was the better of the two as it was rich and buttery and decent sized for $32. As for desert we got the cream puff and the chocolate flan. The chocolate flan was really savory. The combination of the strawberries  chocolate cake flan and whip cream was a match made in heaven . The cream puff option off the restaurant week menu wasn't good in my opinion but my date liked it .. This restaurant is definitely now one of my favorites just don't get the watermelon salad." u'Overpriced overhyped overdone short rib and baby suckling pig. \xa0Granted all the food was played nicely and presented well on plates. \xa0The block of pig meat was dry and needed extra gravy but the roasted veggies were delicious- especially the cauliflower. Its impossible to have a conversation here as the sounds are horribly amplified and you are packed into rows of tables and chairs. \xa0The decor and staff were very nice. They also serve food so quickly not a good place for a leisurely dinner. \xa0Drinks are $14-$17. \xa0Pre-fixe menu $50 with a small plate literally; an entree and one kind of lowbrow desert--extra for coffee $3.00--- just too much. \xa0The owners picked a good location to charge super high prices for not such a high quality food. \xa0 Service was good however.' u'East of 9th Ave offers us a scary tourist-ridden section of NYC and Toloache is one of the few culinary offerings that makes the trip beyond 9th Ave okay. It isn\'t the cheapest meal but try Toloache for lunch as they have many of the same gastronomic highlights as the evening menu. Their cocktails (priced $13+) sounded delicious but we didn\'t indulge during this recent visit. We ordered:Pomegranate guac (Medium spiciness) toro taquitos  truffle quesadilla and spicy lobster tacos. Everything was delicious. The guacamole was pretty straightforward and frankly sounded a little more exiting than it was but the guacamole was executed well regardless of its creative shortcomings.The toro ceviche was awesome- 4 little "taquitos" served in hard shells with two juicy lime wedge. It had just the right amount of spice and zest and acted as a great palette cleanser before moving on to our entrees. The truffle quesadilla does not have any meat on it but you hardly miss it when you\'re hit with the distinct fragrance of black truffles and cheese. The spicy lobster taco (two tacos served with rice and beans) was meaty and seasoned nicely. Service was attentive prompt and we were in and out fairly quickly!Perfect for: non-stuffy business lunch lunch with friends while romping through midtown' u'Incredible food!! We had a reservation for later in the evening but showed up a few hours beforehand and they sat us right away at the bar. Luida (sorry for misspelling her name) was very friendly and brought us waters ASAP. We ordered the fruity guacamole with mango chunks and pomegranates and I think I was transported to another world- INCREDIBLE flavor. We then ordered steak tacos and a chicken quesadilla which was yes you guessed it off-the-charts. Location was superb- right in the theater district only a few steps away from where we were seeing a show after dinner. Would recommend in a heartbeat!' u"Was excited for this place after accidentally eating a piece of their grasshopper tacos at a food event. I drank a bit too much and thought it was roasted mushrooms....it was pretty good till I found out what it was. So back to what I ordered at the restaurant:- Trio guac and chips: pretty solid (one with pomegranates is my fav)- Shrimp entree: nothing notable about this dish- Spicy black kale: the star of the night spice wasn't really existent but it tasted pretty darn good- Bone marrow taco: Solid taco but nothing memorable- Desserts: tried a couple-- best would be the Mexican spiced chocolate cakeAside from the food the service is very slow. I won't be back." u'What is better that sitting with your number one right next to a couple who\'s on their first blind date? Uhmm nothing?! Even more things to (secretly) chat about. And what\'s even better? Sitting at a table so close to them that only your index finger can fit in between - now that\'s what I call "too close for comfort".Toloache is everything you\'d expect from a crowded Mexican fare eatery. A loud atmosphere drinks GALORE tables being turned by the minute dishes clanking... all in good taste.Speaking of good taste. You should really invest big bucks into their food. It is phenomenal. Drinks are exceptional as well... PACKED with alcohol but perfect balance of flavor and zing.APPETIZERS:- \xa0 \xa0Callos de Hacha: Seared sea scallops w/ quinoa risotto porcini mushroom and huitlacoche butter- \xa0 \xa0Costilla & Tuetano: Beef short ribs w/ bone marrow Thai basil and roasted red onion-jalapeno chiles toreadoWe\'re big diver scallop fans couldn\'t resist the temptation of devouring these divine morsels. Who knew cheesy quinoa would go so well with scallops! Very mild cheese flavor with the mild seafood flavor pairs so effortlessly and cohesively. Tacos were notably fresh. Sauce was pretty spicy given the fact it was jalapeno it most definitely had a kick. \xa0ENTREES:- \xa0 \xa0Tumbada: Veracruz-style paella epazote-scented rice lobster chicken chorizo shrimp clams octopus achiote sauce and pico de galloRice was on the more mushy side I think they overcooked it just a tad in the stock. Overall flavor was great a bountiful of seafood and a perfect portion.DESSERT:- \xa0 \xa0Pastel de Chocolate: Warm Mexican chocolate cake w/ dulce de leche ice creamGotta have dessert right? Not you standard chocolate cake that\'s for sure. This number was packed with Mexican spices and was oh so ooey-gooey. Dulce de leche ice cream was the perfect pairing to this unctuous finale of a dinner.Great food. Great atmosphere. Exceptional wait staff. Toloache you\'re in my Top-10 for sure!' u'Liked everything! Excellent tastes nice portions very good services. Delicious margaritas and variety of tequilas. Really nice environment and tunes. Recommend reservations at prime time.' u"Small crowded almost stifling place where tourists come to mingle. I had been here a few years before and didn't find it near as annoying. Maybe it wasn't filled with so many people not from the area I'm not sure but I wasn't impressed.I don't know why I don't give this place one star. They charge you by the (smallest) glass (ever) for soft drinks (at $3 each) which is a mortal sin in my book. I understand it's the cheapest way to make the most money but you could be a little less gauche about it. At least give an adult size glass for that. Either way I wouldn't return ever just because they do this. If you want locals to come here stop treating them like tourists. My girlfriend and I ordered the guacamole. It came premixed (not done at the table like better restaurants do) in again the smallest bowl they could find while charging an outrageous amount ($15). The chips were nice and salty and really held up to the dense guacamole. So plus for that. They had what tasted like a really nice yet thin and almost watery side dip that had a nice smokey adobe taste. Not terrible but alone it would have been insufficient. Paired with the guac it wasn't terrible. We each ordered ceviche out of the three they had. My friend had the perauno and it was presented beautifully and tasted divine. I ordered the hamachi and almost spit it out from all the lime juice used in it. It was also a much smaller portion and presented messily. I wasn't impressed with mine at all. Seriously watch out for the pucker factor you won't be happy unless you like the feeling of sucking on a lime with every bite.We then ordered quesadillas. I ordered the shrimp and my friend ordered chicken. Beautifully presented although hers looked very sparse compared to mine. I remember hers not resembling a quesadilla so much as an open faced tortilla. Mine was made like a normal quesadilla. Both were very flavorful but again don't look for value in this food you won't find it. If you want to spend a LOT to barely get a taste then this is your place. I'm not really sure how they get such great reviews. If you head AWAY from Times Square (or even go to Iguana's just a few blocks over where you get real value for great food) you'll find a lot better. Will not return.Edit: I live almost right in Times Square so I understand how expensive everything is but this place is just exploiting tourists. Regardless of how good food tastes to pay this amount of money for what you get is highway robbery." u'I was a little unsure of what to make of this place when my wife made the reservation however the food here really stood up to my critical expectations. I found the house guajillo salsa to be perfectly spicy the pumpkin seed guacamole to be simply impressive and my suckling pig crispy carnitas to be absolutely delicious. Cocktails were on point too. \xa0A little pricey aggressively loud and a little cramped yes but the food here is well worth it.' u"New to New York and I really wanted some Mexican food. Found this on yelp. The decor is very unique and small. It's a type of fancy authentic style Mexican cantina. The staff is excellent attentive and sweet. Small menu. We order guacamole which was great but too expensive for the size $14 for a small cup. The drinks were delicious ranging from $12-$16 but worth it. The food was absolutely delicious! Authentic and everything tasted like it was homemade with the freshest ingredients. Me and my friends will definitely be back. I'll post pictures of the lunch.. total bill was $160 ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT ***NO BURRITOS***" u'I was in here yesterday evening with a friend. The place was packed and we were stuck eating at a counter between the bar and the first floor tables.We ordered drinks. I ordered the blueberry margarita. \xa0My drink did not take long. \xa0The margarita was purplish in color and tasted more like a regular lime margarita and not much like blueberry which I was actually glad about.As for food I ordered the shrimp Toloache. My dining companion ordered When my entree came out It was piping hot and looked invitingIN the menu description it described it as spicy and thankfully delivered on that promise. The sauce was very spicy to the point that I was glad for the spaghetti squash that topped the dish as it was crisp and a bit sour. \xa0The black beans were at the bottom and it was a different taste with the shrimp than I am used to I liked the texture combination of the shrimp and the beans along with the softened crispy tortilla. It was cooked crispy but the sauce made the tortilla a bit soft.When we asked for the check it did not take long to get it since they were so packed.A word about seating. The bar is to the right. The small counter we sat at was not tha conducive to eating entrees but it would be fine for appetizers. There are tables on the first floor and second floor. It seems they were trying to ensure every space was filled. \xa0If you tend to feel claustrophobic I would recommend trying this place when it is not busy.' u"We made an open table reservation here to enjoy a dinner before seeing the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. We were seated right away and our server Octavio was fantastic from start to finish---very impressive considering how packed the restaurant was and how little space they had to work \xa0with. Really cool feel and decor overall---definitely a place with personality! We started with the guacamole (mild) and then enjoyed the tortilla soup and the chicken quesadilla which were all super fresh and well done. We also got to see the guacamole making man in action which was pretty neat! Portions were smaller for the price but was enough to fill you up enough. \xa0I tried the red sangria which was also tasty but most people seemed to enjoy the margaritas which is what they're famous for!Tips:-definitely make a reservation!-half of the dining tables are on the second floor (no elevator) so be sure to note this if someone in your group might have trouble with a steep flight of stairs-it's in close proximity to all of the Broadway shows radio city and Rockefeller so perfect place if you're headed to one of those venues-they have a taco made with grasshopper...if you try it you'll have to let me know how it is!" u"Everything is about 20% overpriced. The first time we went the food was delicious but they sat us so tightly between other tables we couldn't even carry on a conversation because everything around us was so loud and tightly spaced. The second time we went we sat in a better place but the (overpriced) food was mediocre at best. Both my dinner and my partners dinner was extremely under seasoned. I had to pour a TON of salt on my dish to make it passable. Won't be returning." u'My friends and I were out for some pre-holiday drinks to catch up and one started craving the queso fundido. So we headed over there at about 9:30pm. The place was still packed on a Wednesday night. We grabbed a spot at the bar and ordered some drinks. I got the sangria and my friend got the La Flaca (pomegranate margarita) \xa0 They were both very good. We did get the queso fundido con chorizo as well as some chips & salsa to snack on. The queso fundido came with warm tortillas and was delicious. The portion size allowed us to have four tortillas (almost rolled taco size.) if you have four or less people one might be ok but any more people and you should order two. \xa0If you want more than one serving each then get two as well.' u'Left feeling a little underwhelmed - and hungry. Got the avocado fries toro taquitos and the short rib quesadilla. The avocado fries were pretty good never had them before so worth a shot. Then the tuna taquitos. These were ok however nothing special. Also a little heavy on the raw onion which was a bit overpowering. The short rib quesadilla was decent but nothing to write home about either. Extremely small portions for everything. I understand these items are intended as apps but typically I would say 3 apps should be enough for a meal. The food was overall good however i feel due to the pricing mixed with extremely small portions leads to this 3-star review.Might be back to give it another shot.']
125.Lucky’s Famous Burgers,[u"I've heard that this is the place to go in Hell's Kitchen for a late night burger and that the Turkey Burger is one of the best around. I was in the area on a Sunday afternoon and ended up here at the suggestion of a couple of friends. A pretty small place with only a couple of seats this is a order and pay at the counter kind of place and I think most people end up getting their food to go. In fact we were the only ones inside the restaurant eating while we were there but several people came in and grabbed to go orders. Turkey Burger didn't disappoint. Extremely hot and wrapped in foil the burger was seasoned well and the signature sauce was great on it!I can tell why people like this place on their way home from a night out!" u'I\'m a burger person so my evaluation will be a bit more stringent than the average Jo. \xa0At my kids recommendation I ordered from the 52nd st location and the food was decent. \xa0I had a cheeseburger and fries and neither was anything special. \xa0Don\'t get me wrong the food was good just not "amazing".Burgers are heavily seasoned so can be spicy.' u'Love the food. But...My last experience was totally unfortunately unforgettable!! I ordered on seamless about 12:30PM. A BBQ burger and a soda. I was told it would be delivered at about 1:15 - 1:30 PM. *Sidebar: I had a bus to catch that day at PA at 2:30. *Once it hit 1:50 PM i made sure my order had went though. Proven by email receipt & text message alerts. I called at 2:00 PM. Asking where my order status was & how long it would take. The lady seemed nice. I didnt want to give an attitude for no reason. ( thats honestly what i was thinking ) THEN! She tells me the order hasnt been made. Due to another order who had my same name \xa0How many Sabrina\'s are in MANHATTAN LET ALONE NEW YORK CITY! When she read out my address she didnt know it was my address til I confirmed it. Her excuse was non excusable & honestly retarded. Why should an order not be made due to same names but clearly different addresses. I asked for a refund and profusely gave her a piece of my mind. Quickly shouted "No!" That i didnt want the order to be made because i needed to catch a bus that i was surely ganna be late for. Havent ordered from Lucky\'s since. I miss it. But i am not going through that stupidity again. Sorry.' u"THIS IS FOR THE EAT24 ORDER: What I got: Turkey burger with added toppings: sauteed onions sauteed mushrooms pepperjack cheese jalapenos and pickles. Sweet potato fries on the side. Food: Definitely not the healthiest but...... The turkey burger hit the spot- it was delicious! I bet it tastes better when you actually dine in. Since I got mine delivered the bun was a bit too soft. But the meat was perfectly juicy and cooked the toppings werent overwhelming and were properly sauteed like I had asked. The sweet potato fries were no where near crunchy or crisp they were just too oily and super limpy. But given that I didnt dine in and had it delivered on a super windy rainy NYC evening I won't complain too much. Service: My 4 stars mainly stem from the fact that delivery was so quick and they also paid attention to any extra notes I made like sending an extra plate and mustard on the side. I find it hard to have reliable delivery in NYC but this place seems attentive. Price: Eh average. I spent $16 for food and tip included so it wasn't bad but I'd definitely get more bang for my buck if I had gone elsewhere.Will I order again?Idk about order but if I'm around I'd be curious to dine in and see if theres any difference in the quality of the food." u'Guilty pleasure of savory grease. Charming staff. I am in love with the Chelsea burger (it has cheese mushrooms and a massive onion ring as toppings). And adore the chicken fingers (mix the BBQ sauce it comes with with the "Lucky Sauce" (which I think is mayo and BBQ combined)). The fries are just okay standard crinkle fries. The onion rings are excellent (breaded instead of battered.' u"On my friend's last day in NYC she mentioned that she really wanted a burger. I was interested in finding something a bit low key the hole-in-the-wall type of spot something with a simple concept a condensed menu and that's exactly what I found at Lucky's.I especially like the layout of the menu - easy to navigate and the details of each item are all provided. My friend ordered the Hell's Kitchen and I settled on the Chelsea. We spit an order of smokin' fries (the cajun seasoning adds heat and a smoky flavor to the fries).Good burgers seasoned well very flavorful and the components for each individual style work in their respective fashion." u"For NYC it's a decent size burger joint- enough room to sit and enjoy your meal. The burger could have been a little bit larger -but it was very tasty . I think the reviews overhyped this establishment ... The food was satisfying but not ridiculously amazing.Friendly staff .* try the chipotle mayo" u"If you want just a good ol' classic cheeseburger fries and a milkshake that's not too expensive but way better than McDonalds then here's a good place! They have some cool sauces you can put on your burger or just get on the side as well. Staff was nice too!It was a good burger what else can I really say? Nothing to call home about but I was definitely happy and full when I left." u'5 stars for amazing burgers plus they will make low carb lettuce wraps for you. The chicken fingers are also really good here not your usually frozen chicken fingers you get at most places in Manhattan. These are actually battered and made by hand. The Chipotle mayo and their house lucky sauce are both great.' u"The best part truly is that it's open really really late. Like post-clubbing late. And you all know that you get hungry at that time. This location in Hell's Kitchen is great because there's plenty of nightlife nearby.It's not a huge place - more of an order and pick up but they do have some small tables and a bar-like area looking outside (open to the sidewalk area). They sell the items you'd expect. Burgers fries onion rings hot dogs. Comes out in about 10 minutes and the food ain't bad at all! The onion rings were awesome and crispy. The fries were addictive. And the burgers just greasy enough to soak up some of that gin in your stomach. The place is also a hot mess at 3am so people watching is fantastic." u"Lucky's Burgers were tasty and the fries are fried crunchy which I love. This helps the fries uphold with the delicious cheese sauce that's optional. The burger had pink more than I would have liked. I don't mind pink in steaks and burgers but not too much in a burger. It would be helpful if they asked you how you want it cooked or notify you up front. Hence the reason for 4 stars. The strawberry shake was also delicious. I definitely plan to go back and give it another go. I love cheeseburgers so it won't be hard to go back! The place is small and cozy. It got pretty packed around lunch so be mindful of that. It has a 70s/80s theme with bar stools for window seats and booths with chairs. Not the biggest restaurant but the theme is very cute! If you like burgers you'll like Lucky's." u"Got a late night craving that can hit the spot but you know is horrible for your arteries? Lucky's is your place. Their loaded french fries is a must-get -- these freshly fried potatos are topped with a delicious chili sauce cheese jalapenos & sour cream. For even more flavor dip those fries into the signature Lucky's sauce. You won't regret it." u'The burgers could be a little bigger but overall the food is nothing short of the greasy deliciousness you would expect from such a joint! \xa0We ordered for pickup at 8:30 on a Friday night and it was ready in under 15 minutes.' u"This place is amazing. Great burgers reallllly good fries and great sauces. Good prices too especially for NYC. It was $19 for two (big) burgers plenty of fries for 2 and a drink. Couldn't ask for any more." u"Wow I didn't know food could be this BAD. Food was over cooked and over priced for what it was. I wish I hadn't wasted my $. It is a glorified McDonald's but it is so much worse. Food was very bland and didn't REALLY have a signature taste to have the word FAMOUS in its name. If anything it should be famous for being the worst food in town." u"I eat meat. Sorry to all my veggie and vegan friends but I'm a carnivore. Not that I don't like my veggies - I still do as long as they're alongside a big slab of red MEAT! \xa0As a long-time Hell's Kitchen resident and inept cook I'm always on the prowl for a juicy burger. I stopped in at Lucky's to try them out for lunch the other day. \xa0Definitely not the best burgers in HK but not too bad either they're worth a shot. I liked the fact that you can build your own burger (starting at $6). I chose the 100% Angus Beef patty with Jalape\xf1o Pepperjack cheese BBQ sauce and grilled mushrooms wrapped in a Martin's Potato Bun (lettuce tomato raw onions grilled onions pickles and jalape\xf1os come with it for free).I ordered my burger bloody rare but it came to me medium. Not wanting to be a PITA I kept it anyway. Flavorful yet a bit overcooked for my liking it was decent. I'd stay away from the BBQ sauce though. I did thoroughly enjoy their signature ' Lucky's Loaded Fries ' (they come smothered in Angus beef Chili jalape\xf1os chopped onions bacon cheddar cheese sauce & sour cream). YUMMY for my tummy but KILLER for my arteries. It's great that they're open till nearly 5:00am on the weekends and I bet get a ton of business by the drinkers out there. Maybe I'll go back when I have a few in me and try them again but until then I'll stick with my favorite burger in the Kitchen over at Island Burgers." u'The staff here were super friendly. I got a cheeseburger with egg & avacado and fries with cheese on the side. The burger was a little more well done than I would\'ve liked and the fries were a little hard but the overall quality of the food was good. The "lucky sauce" is yummy and the cheese cup they give you on the side of your fries is huge! This wasn\'t my first time here and it won\'t be my last. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a late night bite.' u"About a year ago I used to love ordering from Lucky's. The burgers were always great well cooked with great sauces. I especially loved their loaded fries. I recently moved back to NYC and decided to order from them again. My burger unfortunately was very dry with no flavor but the thing that really disappointed me was that there were no lucky's special sauce in there!! The fries were good but had become soggy which might be my fault because I picked up the food and walked back home instead of having it delivered. I may or may not give them a chance in future." u'One double patty cheddar cheese burger with fries and a cup of coke(combo) cost 14 bucks before taxes. The burger itself is just mediocre. Considering the sizeand ingredients\' quality of the burger it\'s expensive $$$ even for tourist area. I don\'t know who rated this burger shop cheap $ maybe they come from Saudi Arabia.There is a "tip" option on credit card receipt. I paid $3 that I expect someone bring the food to my seat at least. But no there is ZERO service. Then why the heck suggesting "tips" on the receipt? Horrible experience.' u"Cheeseburger Med rare ketchup and LETTUCE with fries. I also got a root beer. I work near here I've ordered three times and my order is never right! Than the girls on the phone are nasty! How?! Pretty much they forgot the lettuce and I called back and usually I'd just have them send it to me but she was so nasty I was like no just send my money back! How are you nasty when you guys messed up?!?! Where is the manager of this place????!!!! I also called for extra ketchup I offered to pay for the extra ketchup apparently I'm not allowed more than four packs. Even though I offered to PAY for them. Jennifer took my order. Great alternative to this place is American Retro they don't have all the same food but if you're going for just a buger give them a call."]
8.Tony’s Di Napoli,[u'This is one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever tried.The food is amazing everything fresh tasty and the customer service is amazing. The restaurant has a live atmosphere and you will definitely enjoy dining in.The food portions are big and each dish definitely is enough for at least 2 people. We ordered chicken Alfredo past as well as the Arugula Salad. Both were tasting great and we enjoyed them a lot. The server was really helpful and attentive to our needs with great recommendations.Will definitely repeat and recommend to food lovers.' u"I took a star away because of the price. \xa0I know it's in the theater district but I compared the prices to the other location and it's a little cheaper at the other location. \xa0This place is really nice. I'm from L.A and wanted to visit NYC and of course I had to see a show on Broadway and have a nice dinner. \xa0The service was good the food and dessert were good." u'Family style chow until your gut bursts but your taste buds will thank you. A must stop for tourists and large groups of 6 or more to sit munch. I love the black ink linguini under a massive bed of seafood in their house Marina gravy. This is what Italian dreams are made of. The portions are colossal family style. The variety is magnificent from Chicken eggplant Veal saltimbocca Large ass Veal chops and the assorted Italian meat platter will surely trigger anyone\'s inner carnivore to pull the proverbial Tony the \xa0Tigers " There Great." Elegant yet simple old school Pisano burnt yellow walls with dark wooden finish throughout both up and down stairs. Groups can get a bit rowdier down stairs from my experience but the place in general is quite loud. Not a place for an intimate date night. The bill can get painfully hefty as bottles of red and white complete the meal at hand. So I\'d be careful placing additional orders especially when it comes to the tantalizing Italians desserts all encompassing chocolate and cream treats that will surely end any diet.Fun and food combined = be back again and again.' u'Perhaps I had too much expectation perhaps I came in during peak dinner time.I was arriving at the Penn station that evening by Amtrak from north and I know train tends to be late in the afternoon I didn\'t want to make reservations for dinner until I know what time I may be able to arrive. I called this restaurant from the train to make reservation and walked from Penm station (I realized I should have taken a subway later).When we arrived they were really busy people without reservation were waiting. Service was slow particularly our server. She honestly had difficult time keeping track. She came back twice after she took our order asking if we decided what we wanted. When she saw my face she realized she already took our order. Pasta was good good texture and flavor but not the best. Chicken and shrimp from main dish had good lemony flavor but lacking some buttery taste. Chicken was so dry after two bites I couldn\'t eat anymore. My colleague from overseas ate most of it as he was trying to be polite. She never came back to see if we liked our food until we asked for a check. \xa0I mentioned chicken was dry all she said was "but you ate most of it". After that I just paid and left. I think this place do well for its location. So close to Broadway and Times Square constantly getting more tourists from all over the world they could care less for one disappointing customer.' u"If you told me that NYC didn't have an Italian restaurant by the name of Tony's I wouldn't believe you. You could probably knock me over with a meatball. My friend suggested we have dinner here and we didn't have a reservation. Even on a weekday evening the place was packed and chaotic. Before we knew it we had waited an hour. Finally we were seated in the back of the restaurant. Luckily we used the time to catch up. My advice is: if you have to get stuck waiting for a table at a restaurant it's best to go with someone you haven't seen in a while so once you are deep in conversation the wait doesn't seem so bad. Even though we knew about the giant family-style portions that didn't stop us from ordering a platter each. In hindsight we should have shared one platter and an appetizer or something. Our two giant plates of pasta barely fit on our little table for two.$30 Linguini w/ Clams in white sauce:Sometimes restaurants skimp on the seafood but not this one. My plate was loaded with clams mostly shelled and a few still in their shells for presentation I suppose. The sauce was a light and salty broth but almost too salty while the linguini was nice and smooth.$28 Baked Ziti Bolognese w/ penne:Super cheesy & rich. It was baked with a whole lot of mozzarella and the meat sauce was buried underneath with a mountain of penne. Everything tasted delicious and this is coming from someone who doesn't often get excited about pasta. The noodles and everything stick together so it was a little difficult to serve ourselves. Our waiter saw that I was having difficulty scooping up long strands of linguini so he served us. We definitely ended up with a ton of leftovers. If I come back I would definitely go with a group with large appetites. & I would plan ahead and make reservations." u"On a typical Wednesday night it is usually really packed for dinner as groups and groups of people all meet up together to enjoy a family style Italian meal. I requested for a reservation between 5:30-6:00pm but the only available time was 7:00pm which I opted in for. It was a tad late considering I have work the next day. I was very close to going somewhere else but glad that I didn't. I did not have high expectations nor a craving for Italian food but I'm glad it all worked out just fine at the end. - Arriving a few minutes before my reservation I still had to wait close to 15-20 minutes to be seated. Once I was seated the waiter swiftly came by to give out menus and asked any drinks were needed besides water. The menu was very extensive which took me awhile to decide what to get. I finally decided on the Spaghetti and Meatballs and Seafood Black Linguine. This was way more than enough for four people could even feed 6-8 people. The Seafood Black Linguine was huge compared to the Spaghetti and Meatballs. Filled with clams mussels shrimp and tons of scallop it felt like a seafood galore. The black linguine was hidden away from all the seafood that was on top. For a minute I forgot there was linguine in the first place. The best part was definitely the black linguine - definitely got me craving for more. The sauce that was used was very light and definitely accentuated the brilliant taste the black linguine had. For the spaghetti and meatballs the best part was the meatballs. I mean spaghetti is just spaghetti right? But the meat balls were the bomb! It came with four huge meatballs; the size of a fist. One of the best meatballs I have had for a long time next time I definitely want to opt in just ordering a side of meatballs. I'm glad I got the meatballs or else I wouldn't have known that the meatballs were such a signature dish here." u"I love love love Tony's! Went here for my dad and sisters birthday in July! Family style at its best! The chicken parm and penne ala vodka are my absolute favorites!! The portions are HUGE even for family style. They serve anywhere from 4-5 ppl. We had left overs! There were 7 of us lol. The servers are friendly as I have always experienced at both locations. The atmosphere is upbeat. Reservationist is very good at being one time at this location esp since it can get busy being in the heart of time square! Finally the deserts the deserts are out of this world. They'll even make a family style platter for you if you would like. Tony's- DO IT." u"An overall great experience and a big shout-out to Nina and the staff for being so accommodating! Two of us arrived at 6 but had a Broadway show to catch at 7 and after letting Nina know the situation she said she'd put in rush orders for all the food and get us to our show on time.Note: The portions here are ridiculous if you only have two people but the food was great!We ordered the calamari appetizer which was perfectly fried and came with a delicious marinara-esque dipping sauce. But the star of the meal was the black linguine seafood pasta! Looking past the gargantuan portion size the noodles were delicious and all the seafood was fresh and tasty. The staff members were kind enough to wrap up all the leftovers and have us on our way with enough time to make it to the theater!" u"Went for lunch with a friend and it was delicious. Normally it is more family style but during lunch they have individual size entrees. My friend and I couldn't decide what we wanted so we ordered 3 entrees. Spaghetti and meatballs Tony's chicken and penne alla vodka. Everything was so delicious. We hardly made a dent in any of it (our eyes were bigger than our stomachs) but the food was excellent and very fresh. Service was very quick which is perfect for lunch time and the waiter was very nice. I would go back again for lunch or dinner ! Pricing was reasonable. We split the bill and it was $30 each for 3 entrees." u"The sangria here is sweet but not sure how much wine is actually in there. The stuffed mushrooms were ok but very oily and can't compare to Olive Garden ones. The entree portions are huge and as recommended we shared between two people. But we still couldn't finish our chicken parm. The chicken was tender and overall it was good but nothing incredibly special. I will advise against getting the tiramisu. It was very soggy soaked with too much Bailey's and inedible. The service was excellent. The waiter took great care of us. The manager even stopped by the table to check on us and topped up our sangria!" u"Came here as a recommendation from a friend. It was almost impossible to get a reservation or seating from what I hear but he thankfully made it happen.We went at 5pm due to a show after and it was packed already!! It's family style but since my boyfriend and I have different tastes we got our own plates anyway and ate what we wanted. Even so and with a bottle of wine the bill was not outrageous and would've been the same at a regular restaurant! If we were doing family style it would've been even cheaper.I got the gluten free penne with clams (white). Since it was GF it was penne instead of linguine. The clams were fresh but I wish there was more sauce to make it tasty. The pasta was overcooked but hey they have GF!! My boyfriend got a special- orecchiette with sausage tomatoes and broccoli rabe. I tasted the vegetables and the flavor was amazing.Wine was ok service great. Atmosphere loud but nice. Definitely recommend but for larger groups." u"Finding a decent pre-show restaurant in the theater district has got to be one of my all-time least-favorite activities. It's right up there with doing laundry and enduring gynecologist appointments. \xa0But I'd heard good things about Tony's DiNapoli from you fellow Yelp people and to my great relief it did not disappoint.We arrived for 5:30 reservations to celebrate my mom's birthday dinner and had no problem being seated. This space is huge. So many tables so many people very theatre district-y. Our waiter was kind and helped us choose the rigatoni vodka with mushrooms and the branzino special.I was a bit skeptical about ordering the branzino since this spot is more known for its cheesy saucy dishes. But my mom and grandma are big fish people so we went for it. And it was actually really delicious! My sister actually said it was the best fish she'd ever had -- and she's a picky eater.The pasta was on point; absolutely stellar vodka sauce. For dessert we ordered the ricotta cheesecake (candle in it and all very cutely done) and it was also super tasty.Overall Tony's DiNapoli is a great spot for a family pre-show dinner. Would I come back if I weren't seeing a show? Probably not but that's just because I prefer smaller bistro/wine bar places over big rowdy spaces. But the food is on point. You won't be disappointed." u'Came here after watching the Lion King which was just across the street from Times Square I read it on YELP as having gluten-free fare and great service.Sure enough this Italian restaurant is like a 5 star Michelin Starred spot it was excellent from the food to the drinks everything was delicious. Walking in it feels like an old vintage Italian house with cool chalkboards on the wall with all the menu items. The servings are pretty big enough for 2 or 3 people so order light and they also have gluten free pasta which is excellent just inform your server!' u"If there's a Tony in Tony's Di Napoli he needs to come to LA and open another restaurant. Talk about Italian food Italian style! This restaurant is a family style establishment with dishes that serve 2-3 people. This isn't ideal for two people because we wanted to try everything on the menu. As we checked in for our reservation and were seated we were surprised to find out that our waiter was from the same area we were from. He was super friendly and made a bunch of suggestions for us. Because the posted were so large he offered to ask the kitchen if we can order a few lunch portions in order to try more things on the menu. Those who read my Yelp reviews know what customer service means to me. This was awesome because we got to order three items from the menu that stood out: penne ala vodka chicken parmesan and linguini with seafood. The penne ala vodka was filled with mushrooms and lots of sauce. The pasta was fresh and the sauce was so creamy. The cream tomatoes and vodka came together to create this miracle sauce that I can't explain. This dish was comfort food at its finest. The chicken parmesan is a must order here. Per the recommendation of our waiter we ordered the lunch portion of this decedent dish that blew me away. The chicken breast had an amazing crispness to it and the chunky tomato sauce and melted cheeses were the perfect consistency. The flavors were amazing. The linguini with seafood was by far my favorite. The linguini was super fresh and they were not shy with the seafood in the dish. There were tons of jumbo shrimp clams mussels and calamari in the entree all seasoned and cooked to perfection. The tomato base sauce was not overpowering the seafood and was delicious. All in all a great place to dine in Times Square in terms of cost location service and of course food! I loved the energy of the restaurant and its busy-ness on a Saturday evening." u"I'm pretty sure I wont be going back to Carmine's anytime soon. This is my new spot!! The menu;'s are similar but no wait! The staff was super friendly. The sorbet martini I absolutely l think I had 4!! The manager came over and greeted us which was great. Will be back soon!" u"My group of six had an awesome time at Tony's on a recent visit to NYC. We didn't stop raving about it for days. We planned on dining in on a Friday night so we made sure to make a reservation. We were seated at the lower level. It looked like every other table was occupied by a big group. It was noisy but we liked the positive energy. Everyone seemed to be having a great dinner and there was some loud birthday song singing.Our server was a pleasant fellow who made sure we were taken of. The only funny thing was when he described the portion sizes of the pasta dishes to us he said they were good for 2-3 people. They really were much bigger than that! We ordered a Greek salad calamari seafood linguine with lobster and chicken cacciatore. We ate ourselves to a coma and still had a ton of leftovers!We all loved the calamari. It was simple not fancily seasoned but well done. It had a nice little crunch on the outside and tasted fresh. The seafood linguine was a huge hit as well and our favorite part about it was that it had the most generous amount of seafood we'd seen in a pasta dish! It even looked like it had more seafood than pasta which we didn't mind at all. The sauce was divine! It had a lot of that yummy briny seafood juice.We paid a reasonable price for our huge meal plus a few drinks and coffee!All in all not the perfect date spot if you're going for quiet and intimate but highly recommended for big loud groups with a hankering for a delicious family-style Italian meal!" u"I was hoping for a better meal. \xa0The red checker table cloth the southern Italian cooking all spelled promising. \xa0The food however was ordinary and overcooked. \xa0No standouts among the four dishes we ate. \xa0If you need a quick meal in the theater district and don't want to spend a lot this may do the trick. \xa0Otherwise you can to better a few doors down at the Brooklyn Diner." u'Excellent staff service a food. \xa0I was so impressed watching the management of this place during a very chaotic dinner time. \xa0Very well run family-feel business. \xa0I would send people here.' u'Fantastic food and service! Boyfriend and I went here before theater and in a big rush. Food came out promptly and tasted delicious. No complaints .. very full! Portions are huge great and busy atmosphere friendly staff. - Happy GF' u'Rude service/food was okOk first the good part. For a chain restaurant the food was pretty good. The portion sizes were family style and again pretty tasty. Buuuuut if I\'m in NYC I\'d prefer non-chain. There are so many options. \xa0So this would be 3 starsOk here\'s the missing star. We were a party of 17. Our plates came out and 5 of us at one end had musty smelling plates. Like they were dried with a musty towel. We kindly asked the waitress for new plates and her response was "those are the cleanest plates you\'re gonna get. That\'s just the way our dishwasher soap smells". Um...then why did our appetizer plates not smell ooooor the other 12 people at our table? \xa0My cousin disinfected her plate with the lemon from the calamari before she ate. I passed. Maybe I should have washed it myself in the bathroom? Haha']
210.Mastro’s Steakhouse,[u"The service and food here is fantastic! I haven't gone to Mastro's in other states so I have no idea how it compares to the other locations.My seared sea scallops (with a side of gnocchi) were cooked to perfection. I can't speak on the steaks because I'm a pescatarian. Usually it's not worth it for a non beef eater to go to a steak house but their other dishes and sides are equally delicious.I've also tried the lobster mashed potatoes creamed spinach and Alaskan King Crab black truffle gnocchi. All are delicious. I just don't recommend getting the gnocchi if your main course comes with a side of gnocchi because it gets \xa0too heavy. The service is awesome. Several people come by your table to spoon side dishes into your plate in a impressively quick and organized manner. It's expensive but definitely worth it for those special occasions." u'This place is top notch. I love everything about it.We started with the bacon appetizer which was a special they had that evening. Picture thick cuts of bacon with caramelized edges broiled to perfection and melt in yo\' mouth delicious. Then we moved on to the shrimp cocktail \xa0which really should just be referred to as "small lobster cocktail" because these prawns were ginormous. \xa0Onto the meaty goodness I recommend the chef\'s cut ribeye and the strip; you can easily split these among 4-5 people. Also and I\'m a little afraid to recommend this but our table had the steak prepared without butter and it was still so succulent you really don\'t need it. \xa0For the sides you have to get the lobster mashed potatoes. The sea scallops was also a standout dish served over fluffy pieces of gnocchi. Last but not least if you don\'t get the warm butter cake for dessert I\'m slightly judging you. This is where I make up for the whole \'no butter on the steak\' method; I just save it all for dessert. This cake is amazing and survived on the table for approximately 5 minutes before the table of 4 devoured it. It\'s just that good. \xa0Why you should dine here:All the above and.... the live music. It\'s just one of the things that puts Mastros ahead of all the other steak places in the area. The band is just really talented and plays a mix everything. Did I mention the butter cake? Also this is not a \'grab a quick bite to eat\' place. When you make a reservation here plan on making a night of it. The service is so attentive they just want you to have the best dining experience.. and you will. Also butter cake!' u"What is not to like about Mastro?From delicious food to live music to a very attentive server. Thank You Aaron!! You were awesome!!I had the Chef's Cut slightly above medium rare.My friends loved their NY strip and bone-in filet. All was Perfection! So tender and flavorful.We shared the Lobster Mashed Potatoes.Big portion was more than enough.We also ordered the seared tuna for appetizer and was surprised how flavorful it was. It just melts in your mouth! For desserts we had to get the famous warm butter cake. It was definitely warm and buttery!!We were also given complimentary chocolate cake for my birthday. Also good. but cannot be compared to the butter cake. Overall experience was amazing!The atmosphere and vibes was on point.Definitely looking forward to going back!" u"Wow wow and wow!!! This place blew me away!! We started with some Rockefeller Shrimp (don't miss out) we also got the jumbo shrimp cocktail which came out with all the smoke underneath! Sooo cool!! The service was the best I have ever had in NYC. We were here last Friday night and got a beautiful booth sat side by side enjoying the lovely live jazz!! The bottle of wines were very reasonably prices too. The steak well it's a steakhouse so I'll be honest it's one of the best steaks o have ever eaten!! We had them split the huge ribeye for my husband and I since I knew we couldn't finish it on our own!!! Onto desert...they gave a complementary cake and ice cream that said his name on it...I didn't even tell them it was just on the reservation. Don't miss out on this place it was amazing!" u"To celebrate my sister's birthday I selected Mastro's Steakhouse due to the numerous positive reviews.It turned out to be one of the best overall dining experiences I've ever had from the ambiance to the service and of course the food.We were quickly presented with the bread basket which contained pretzel breads parmesan dusted garlic bread and some other varied breads. The breads were fresh and warm.For an appetizer we actually ordered from the nicely varied sushi menu by selecting the the Sealed Albacore Tuna with Black Truffles.It was served as nine thinly sliced pieces each adorned with a slice of black truffle on top with all pieces sitting on top of a ponzu sauce.The tuna was super fresh (as expected from sushi grade) but the real unique taste was provided by both the black truffle and ponzu. Each was very assertive but paired well together with the black truffle giving a nice mushroom-like earthy flavor and the ponzu giving a really tangy citrus flavor. Excellent dish!The 33oz. Chef's Cut Ribeye Chop was awesome and on par with all the other great steaks I've enjoyed throughout NYC. We each ordered our steaks medium rare but at the suggestion of our waiter we changed it to slightly above medium rare as he informed us that due to the thickness of the steak a medium rare would leave the center pretty much black & blue/rare.The advice was appreciated and the result was indeed as he stated with the slightly above medium rare resulting in a nice medium rare center and a awesome crust on the steak that was so craggly crispy and creviced with flavor.Taste wise it was an awesome example of the traditional time-honored mantra of keeping it simple as I tasted amazing beefy goodness with no fancy rubs or spices hindering the joy of super high quality prime beef with probably nothing more than salt & pepper as seasoning.Our sides of the Alaskan King Crab with Black Truffle and Sugar Snap Peas were served quickly and both plated by our waiter.Gnocchi was again a decadent dish as the gnocchi was soft and flavorful having \xa0been adorned with a cream sauce that was crusted on top and similar to a baked mac and cheese topping. The crab nestled inside the Gnocchi was fresh and it's flavor came through at the end as it has to compete with so many other robust flavors. However I really discern too much of the black truffle in this dish.When it was time for dessert we ordered the signature Warm Butter cake as it was so highly spoken about in various reviews.Our waiter brought out the Butter Cake and also on the plate was a complimentary slice of the Chocolate Layer Cake as the staff at Mastro's remembered it was my sister's birthday.A crisped sponge cake outer layer nestling an equally rich buttery center sponge cake section and served with ice cream on top the signature Warm Butter Cake was like pound cake amped up with butter steroids! So exorbitantly decadent it made the ice cream seem tame by comparison. If that's not enough a side of soft pillowy whipped cream is provided in case you need to go full beast mode.The Chocolate Layer Cake was solid but nowhere near as memorable or tasty as the Butter Cake.I also have to mention the superb service at Mastro's. Our waiter Erin was super informative personable professional and attentive. As stated earlier Erin's suggestion to order the Ribeye Chop slightly above medium rare was spot on. He also was very friendly in chatting with us on various NYC steakhouses and giving us a history of the Mastro's chain.When you go to a higher end restaurant you expect to be a bit wined and dined and the service at Mastro's surely made us feel special.Can't wait till my next Mastro's experience!" u"I've been wanting to come here ever since they opened in NYC! Lucky for me the bf planned a surprise birthday dinner there for me this year :) The host promptly seated us downstairs in a cozy corner but next time I think I'd probably request to sit upstairs so you can enjoy the live music!!! They are an AMAZING cover band! The ambiance is classic but modern at the same time which I really love.Along with my sister/BIL we shared some appetizers and each got our own steaks of course...haha. The waiter recommended the thick cut bacon (pretty similar to peter lugers) and we also chose to get the escargot. The free bread basket had some pretty delicious items too but I didn't want to eat too much since I still had a steak coming! Thick cut bacon was SO fatty but SO good the char was just right. Escargot was in a nice buttery sauce that was perfect for bread-dipping. Now the steaks! The boys got the porterhouse of course and my sister and I chose the 12oz bone-in filet mignon ($57 if I remember correctly). Mine came still sizzling on the plate perfectly medium rare - delicious!!! But after tasting the porterhouse I'd actually prefer that one - more flavor and and texture is actually much better than a filet. Both were good and we all managed to scarf down all of it :D On the side we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and green beans with sliced almonds. The mashed potatoes was obviously delicious and overly decadent haha the chunks of lobster were also humongous. The green beans did a good job cutting the fattyness of the meal so I'm really glad we got it.When it came time for dessert the waiter could not recommend the signature warm butter cake more! When we wanted to order something else he flat out told us not to since there was going to be something else coming (my complimentary birthday slice!). THANK GOD he told us that because the dessert plate was HUGEEEE. Warm butter cake was FANTASTIC but I was happy with just a few bites haha a bit too sweet for me! It's definitely something nice to share with a bunch of friends. Glad it also came with ice cream and a bunch of fruits to balance out the sweetness. The birthday chocolate cake was also pretty decadent so much so that we had to wrap some home :P. I love the place I love the live music I love the steaaaaaaaakk. Round 2 very soon I hope!!!" u'Oh yeah steak! Great selection of steaks seafood and wine. Love the atmosphere live music family friendly but good for business too. I will be back again.' u"Great dining experience from the food to the atmosphere this place has it all.Unlike its more stuffy equivalents Maestros is a the hip and modern way to eat your steak.The space here is very modern large and open with live music and two floors.The staff here is superb always looking out for you and always making sure you are taken care ofThe cocktail list here is great with tons of classics including my personal favorite gin and cucumber.The food:Having been here about 5 times the steak has always been cooked exactly as ordered perfectly juicy and flavorfulFavorite sides and apps:-beef carpaccio-bone marrow-creamed spinach-mac cheeseEven if you don't have room for dessert the butter cake is an absolute must and as the name implies it is so delicious and damn buttery!!!!If you are looking for a steak house with a little more then just amazing steak this is the spot to be." u"Another AMAZING DINNER @MASTROS!!!Always fabulous! Entering my favorite place the hostesses with their smiles and warm welcome greet us by name. I spot our favorite server Jesse. I requested we be seated in his area and they accommodate us as always!Tonight we started with MASTROS Classic Martini and I ordered their Caliente Breeze.. Peppery & Sweet \xa0 Yummy!Manager Greg stops by for a hello.Tomas too! Everyone goes out of their way to ensure you're happy and enjoying!Shrimp Scampi a treat ... A rich pink sauce \xa0with succulent saut\xe9ed shrimp ... OMG... Heaven! Toasted garlic crunchy bread to dip.Caesar on point. Just the perfect touch of cream garlic lemon and croutons. Always a must at MASTROS!Filet Mignon served on a hot hot hot platter to stay warm while we converse listen to the live band sing along and feast on the Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese!!!Cherry Crisp with Vanilla Ice Cream and fresh whipped cream to complete an enormous feast. MASTROS is an amazing experience! Everyone exits with Smiles!! Please do not miss yours! Make your plans for a wonderful time!!Thank you all for another beautiful night! We just love you guys!! \xa0See you soon!!" u"Wow. What a Steakhouse!! I was totally blown away from my first experience here. My favorite Steakhouse in NYC!! Great location food is incredible service is fantastic and it's really nice inside. Sat at the bar for a little bit while waiting for our table such a great atmosphere with the live music. I really can't say enough about the food. The lobster mashed potatoes is AMAZING. If you come here you MUST get that. I don't even have words to describe how good it is. The mac and cheese is also delicious and the steak was of course delicious as well. Highly recommend you come here if you are looking to go to a Steakhouse in the City. This is as good as it gets great vibes in this place and some of the best food I've ever had" u'Nice ambience and a Top 40 piano bar band with nice voices. The lobster mash and mushrooms were nice and buttery!The ribeye the porterhouse and the bone-in filet was all cooked to 1 temperature......WELL DONE!!! When we told the waitress she told us that the plates are 400 degrees so our food keeps cooking as if we are idiots and simple. Not an acceptable response!!! The best response should have been "oh I\'m sorry my apologies I will let the chef know". How can I make it better?Overall a mediocre steakhouse......' u"The Story: Boyfriend's Company Annual Holiday Party. Food: We had a private room reserved for us and it started out with cocktail hour and an open bar. I'm not a big drinker but their Dream Berry Martini is the win! I enjoyed their appetizers - for some reason the chicken with sun dried tomato really stood out to me. The dinner started with jumbo pawn cocktail (you can't even call these shrimp) and it was amazing. I didn't enjoy the Lobster Bisque soup - too creamy and buttery for my taste. I liked their mac and cheese side dish and I ordered a 22oz rib eye for the entree. The steak was tender and juicy but a little on the salty side for me. I got the butter cake as dessert - I wasn't that impressed by it. Price: I cannot comment on it since I was the plus one to the event. But I would assume expensive. Decor: Very trendy but kinda dark in there. Service: The service is EXCELLENT. The waiters holding the appetizers knew I wanted pictures of the food so they kindly took out their pocket flashlight and lit provided lighting onto the food. They had personality as well even joked about coming to me first with all the apps. My drinks were never empty and they noticed I was holding onto skewers from the apps and asked if they can discard that for me (great attention to detail). Even in the bathroom I had someone turn on the sink for me! Parking & Finding the Place: Located on 52nd Street & 6th Avenue. We took a car service in but since the tree is also up at this time of year and we're so close to time square there was A LOT of traffic. \xa0Additional Thoughts:" u"This place is pretty amazing. Went here on a Saturday evening for dinner: I must say everything was DELICIOUS. Drinks- pricey but worth it. Very good and STRONG. Steak- well seasoned juicy their steaks are always a bit undercooked so make sure to be sure about which finish you are asking for. DELICIOUS no matter what. Mac and cheese- big portion to share. Very tasty! Garlic mash- delicious fluffy and well seasoned. Best potatoes I've had in a while! Famous butter cake- a tad toooo sweet for my taste. Not that serious for all the rave.Choc layer cake- just okay ** will be coming back here hopefully soon :)**" u"We came here for my friends birthday and was absolutely blown away! They have suggested this restaurant several times but we had never tried. We are definitely happy we decided to finally check it out. Since we were there with a large group we started with a lot of plates to share. We had oysters on the half shell that were fresh and delicious! We also ahi tuna tostada and hamachi with crispy onions. Both were absolutely fantastic. For my entree I had the Chilean sea bass. The preparation was so simple but absolutely perfect. The fish was cooked and seasoned to perfection. For sides we had the Lobster mashed potatoes Shoestring fries and Brussels sprouts. At this point I was so stuffed but it still couldn't stop me from eating this delicious food. As far as atmosphere this restaurant is on point. They had a live band which really turned the dinner into a night out. I loved it! The only thing I wasn't totally impressed with was the cocktails. I tried 2 different specialty drinks both which were much too sweet for my taste. I look forward to returning great spot!" u"Good service and decor. Nice live music. Disappointed with the steak. I ordered a bone in Kansas city steak. The cut of meat looked okay but was extremely oily. I'm used to steaks with butter like at Ruth Chris but their steak is not as oily or greasy. I couldn't finish it and won't be going back to this Steakhouse." u"It's perpetually night time at Mastro's. \xa0They must have shaded their windows or something because it's disorienting to walk in there. \xa0If you like to skulk around in the dark then Mastro's is the place for you. \xa0The food is on par with all the many other steakhouses in the area - Quality Meats Del Frisco's Bar Americain Ruth Chris Capital Grille Maloney & Porcelli... the list goes on. \xa0Anyway you get my point. \xa0Midtown has a lot of steakhouses and food isn't what sets Mastro's apart. \xa0Why come here then? \xa0For the AMAZING live band! \xa0These guys are crazy talented... one night they did a cover of one of Beyonce's songs and it was spot on. \xa0I think they play every night starting fairly early (like 6 pm)." u"Short and quick review about the filet. AMAZING!!! Extremely tender juicy full of flavor! Hands down the best filet I've ever had! I also had a baked potato on the side which was massive. For the first time I could only eat half! Left a happy girl!" u'My husband and I travel a lot and we visit Mastro\'s every where we go. Last week in Washington DC we went 4 out of 7 nights. So this week we\'re in NY and was excited about making Mastro\'s our home while being in the Big Apple. Our food was good as usual (crab cake wedge salad and a bone in filet). We each ordered a Sidecar cocktail. \xa0Since we go to Mastro\'s all the time we both thought it strange that we didn\'t get any extra Sidecar from our shakers. \xa0Every Mastro\'s that we\'ve gone to (6) has always provided extra. After calming down I advised a different bar tender that we\'ve been to several Mastro\'s and wanted to know if they also give the extra with each cocktail. The bartender said "Yes we do. Don\'t worry about that I\'ll make another one and split it between you and your husband." I thought that was very nice of him. The bartender made the drink walked back over started pouring it and said "By the way the extra was poured into your glass." I was insulted! Did he just call me a liar??? If he would have said that prior to pouring that drink I would have told him to keep it. I don\'t have to lie about a $20 drink!!!! Needless to say that was the last drink of the night for me. I will be taking my business elsewhere during this vacation.' u"Mmm came back again and still in love with the butter cake. The chef's 20 oz sirloin cut is still spot on. Wasn't a fan of the hamachi. Seemed not so fresh and drowned of soy sauce. Truffle oil fries were a little hard and didn't have too much truffle oil. For a quiet Memorial Day night the band was decent and very welcoming to take my kids' Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift requests. The drink pours on my scotch were a bit weak but all in all I'm a fan of the steak and that's what you come for. Solid tasty steak. 4 stars for not cooking on all 5 cylinders tonight." u"Came here for Valentine's Day.Appetizers:Tuna tartare - yummy and very decent portionEscargot - \xa0came out hard and didn't have much tasteBurrata - \xa0had betterSteak - chefs cut ribeye chop. \xa0Amazing. \xa0Sides - Mac and cheese. \xa0Horrible. \xa0If it wasn't a special night and didn't want to ruin other people's experience I would have sent this back. \xa0Not sure how an elite restaurant like this can get it wrong. \xa0The only reason why I would come back is because of the amazing steak"]
113.Churrascaria Plataforma,[u"Went here for my anniversary made the reservation online so convenient came in got seated right away. Live pianist great meat and unlimited sides and salad bar with sushi! We got complimentary dessert from the house for our special occasion. Our waiter had great customer service and had a smile on the entire time. We both really enjoyed this place. Tip for two:Have one person keep their card faced green and the other red & try everything once. Share so you don't overeat anything that you don't really enjoy." u"A truly exceptional dining experience from start to finish. Delicious salad bar with all the usual fare plus sushi fried calamari and so much more. Everything was delicious the meats served at the perfect temperature and perfectly seasoned. The service was second to none with extreme attention to detail. We've been fans of Fogo for many years but Churrascaria Plataforma puts Fogo to shame....seriously. Loved everything about this place and cannot wait to go back!" u"A meat lover's dream. I came here with a bunch of co-workers. First of all their salad bar is dangerous because of the variety and how delicious everything looks/is. Be careful not to fill your appetite and leave room for the main course! They brought out so many different types of meat that I'm not sure if I remember it all. -turkey wrapped with bacon - so juicy-top sirloin - my absolute favorite-pork ribs-leg of lamb - flavorful and not gamey-filet mignon - YUM-chicken thigh-ribeye steak - fatty and juicyThey'll keep coming around asking if you want more! It was heavenly. Then they brought a whole cart of desserts to choose from. I would definitely opt for the chocolate mousse or tiramisu. Overall amazing experience with the food and the staff! Will come again once my appetite recovers." u"I really loved Churrascaria Plataforma! This is one of those rare instances that I would give a 5-star rating. It's not the food that was 5 stars (the food is more like 3) but it was the service and the entire experience overall.I came in on a Wednesday with ressos for me and my boyfriend. It was his birthday so we decided to splurge and head over to a Brazilian AYCE steakhouse. It was between this one and another one but the deciding factor was that this one had sushi at their salad bar. To start they bring you some mini (piping hot) cheese bread. These were amazing! You'll want to keep eating it but don't - because that's how they get you. Fill up on these carbs at the beginning and you won't be able to have as much meat. Same goes for the salad bar. They've got salads pasta salads rice sushi just about a little bit of everything. Nothing really outstanding but this too will fill you up quickly. So try not to eat with your eyes here because you'll want to save room for the main act.This is where you will want to use your coaster. Red means you're full. Green means to keep the nesting coming and they definitely do. Prime rib filet mignon wrapped with bacon pork chops lamb chops spare ribs chicken wings and those were the only few I could remember. Test it out see what you like and what you don't like. I'd recommend trying everything before getting seconds of something. There's just a huge variety you don't want to miss out on. And don't worry - if you have it on red you can always flip it back to green when you're ready. I'm not sure if there's a time limit but they gave us plenty of time to eat. My favorite part was probably the capirinha station. But at $18 a pop it was pretty expensive. However you get to customize it to however you like it. You can choose the flavor you want - passion fruit lime strawberry - how much sugar you want in it and how strong you want it (extra strong for me!)I also told them it was my boyfriend's birthday and if they could bring out something special. So they brought out a cheesecake with sparklers which was a nice touch. I would say - don't go for the food but go for the experience. If you have anybody who hasn't been to a Brazilian steakhouse before this is definitely one you should take them to." u"I moved to the USA a few months ago and have been craving for a genuine brazilian churrasco for a couple of months and i have to say we got it right by coming here! It's the best one I've tried so far and the service there is spectacular! Not to mention that they gave us a dessert to celebrate our 6 month anniversary. I'll definitely be coming back next times I visit NY and highly recommend this place for any Brazilians or appreciatiors of a good brazilian meal!" u'First visit here. A small nice place. Service was attentive and the food was delicious. We tried the octopus the empanadas the beet salad the calamari the oysters (to die for) and I ordered the ribeye steak with cauliflower. Everything was excellent. I wish the beets in the salad were pickled but regardless they were good with green apple slices and goat cheese. The best dishes were the grilled octopus and oysters. We were so stuffed aftee there was no room for dessert. Wonderful experience. Happy Yelping!' u"Came here on a spontaneous night and had one of the best steaks ever! A lot bigger than you think but in a very touristy spot so getting there by car would be time-consuming. Parking: You can get parking validated here at ICON parking across the street. Definitely do it and don't forget.Interior: Super big. Not as fancy as you would think because I came in with a casual button down and jeans. You don't need to dress up but for the vibe I'd suggest you do. Bathrooms are downstairs if you need to wash your mouth or floss its there! Smart and sleek this place is.Food: Steak on steak on steak. Turn your card over to green (signals the servers to come to you) and wait for every type of steak to come to you. Always say yes and try everything because you are paying a butt load of money to eat there lol. Best meat is the filet mignon. The salad bar is a great start even though I got everything but salad such as sushi potatoes mac and cheese etc.Dessert & Drinks: These DO NOT come with the prie fix cost so be aware. Anything in the carts I believe are extra. The dessert seem okay nothing too great but everyone should come here and get a bottle of wine. Whether it is cheap wine or not it was very tasteful with the steak.Service: The one off start is because all the servers weren't as into it as you would think. I got a few servers who were great and even push you to eat their meat there serving but others are just coming around without saying a word and making me feel like what they have ain't good. It would just be extra nice of them to not make it weird for me to say yes to such a nice restaurant. All in all great place if you want to impress your date and or if you want to bring your family and show off how much you make. Jk. But this was a great dining experience!" u"We came here for an early Father's Day lunch and was very happy with the quality of food and service. Our host (Carlos I believe) was especially cordial and friendly. The meats were so fresh tender and juicy. Nothing was under or over seasoned - just perfect. The salad bar also had a very nice selection of vegetables and carbs to balance out the protein. The servers were also very nice and offered extra cuts to the gentlemen at the table.Lastly we were so happy about the $12 parking. It saved us from paying $42 at the Icon across the street and probably 20 minutes of frustration from driving around for street parking. We'll definitely be back soon!" u"Excellent service excellent food! \xa0My one tip for survival is: don't finish everything. Just eat what you like most. If you put something in your mouth and its pretty mediocre don't finish it! They won't charge you for leftovers or anything. Also request the beef ribs. When we went it was the one thing that wasn't paraded around but they will bring it out for you if you ask. The manager and all the staff were incredibly nice and very generous with the meats! Oh and don't waste stomach space on the salad bar." u"I came here maybe ten years ago and had a memorable experience. \xa0I thought after ten years it can't be good any longer. \xa0Wrong! Just as awesome if not better.My only reasons I'd give it 4 stars are for the drinks at the bar (not the caprihana fairy) and dessert. They were overpriced. \xa0My friends old fashioned was small and not made correctly. \xa0Another friend complained hers was small and too sweet. \xa0Honestly though if you have room to drink then props to you. \xa0The food is in great abundance!So we began with the the salad bar. \xa0It's recommended not to fill up here but I honestly can't consume that much meat. \xa0So I sampled most of the items at the salad bar. \xa0The asparagus risotto was creamy and delicious. \xa0All the sushi was fresh. \xa0The Caesar salad dressing was creamy and flavorful. \xa0The mozzarella could have used some basil with it but was still good.On to the meat. \xa0Service was phenomenal! We got to the point where we all were flipped to red and the waiter actually flipped us back to green to try the meat he had. \xa0I'm glad he did. \xa0It looked liked ribs but was one of my favorites. \xa0The prime rib was also delicious. \xa0Another favorite of mine was the bacon wrapped filet mignon.The desserts? \xa0Eh skip it. \xa0I got the chocolate cake which I didn't like. \xa0My boyfriend had the caramel cake which was much better.Each of us cost $120 with one drink unlimited meat and salad bar and dessert/coffee. \xa0It's definitely a great spot to double date and/or bring out of towners." u'Enjoyed my every each bite in here  the service was awesome ! Thinking hold my anniversary party in here next year !' u'Fantastic dining experience. I brought my boyfriend here as a surprise birthday dinner and was nervously hoping that all the great reviews were true. If you know you\'re going there a few days in advance stick to veggies leading up to that point. You will have copious amounts of meat at this place. There is the buffet-style open salad bar which servers various kinds of salad asparagus risotto (fantastic!) and salmon. Make sure you start there and stock up on the veggies. Once you flip your card from red to green which means "Go" they will ceaselessly bring out different kinds of steak pork turkey etc.I was especially impressed by their speedy service. All the servers seem to have an acute sense of spotting green cards on diners\' tables because you don\'t wait more than 30 seconds between different meats are served.Our favorites were the sirloin fried polenta (comes out as a side if you check the box next to it) and pork with Parmesan. We liked that they have authentic Brazilian side dishes written out in Portuguese and an extensive list of cacha\xe7a. Two other things we enjoyed other than the food and service: their premium caipirinhas are made right at your table and there is live bossanova music playing throughout the night. After this experience I\'d say Brazilian rod\xedzio is a must-do for anyone and everyone!' u"So. Much. Meat.Come hungry and check out the salad bar. Skip the seafood- wasn't very fresh.Unfortunately I didn't enjoy a lot of the slices of meat because they were cooked too well done and dry for my liking." u"1990's hotel dining room ambiance aside this place is good. I think I would go so far as to put it on the same level as some of the better Fogo and Texas de Brazil restaurants though my personal favorite is Fogo...Service-wise can't be beat. You're gonna be super-full here super-fast. You turn that little card over and the food will start coming at you fast-and-furious. I thought all the meats possibly with the exception of the flank steak and the lamb were excellent. The sausage is better than most other places we've been to- as were the pork dishes. The Feijoada is probably the best I've ever had (I'm no connoisseur though) though I've seen much better salad bars at other churrascarias. The sides were a bit forgettable but the drinks were strong and tasty (though a bit on the small side). I was tipsy after 1.5 drinks which is always a good sign.We'll definitely return when we're jonesing for some serious protein..." u"I'm a vegetarian giving a 5 star review to a brazilian steakhouse so it must be good...Basic premise is that there is a salad bar small menu of side orders and a red/green card that serves as the stop/go sign for the meat brought to your table. \xa0No main menus. Since I am a vegetarian I ate sides from the salad bar and french fries/cheesy bread. You could easily fill up on the salad bar so my advice is to take it easy. Once you are seated a parade of servers will come around with a bunch of slabs of meat on spikes from which they will cut you a slice if you'd like. The 5 guests I came with all said the meat was excellent. Particular favorites were the chicken hearts and the lamb wrapped in bacon. The interior is beautiful and elegant. We did not have to wait for a table and all the servers were very nice. Almost all of them are Brazilian and speak fluent english and brazilian portuguese. They also have great drinks. I would recommend either the regular caipirinha or wine caipirinha." u"Best food great service we had the best time celebrating my Son and his Wife's Wedding Anniversary I didn't want it to end we will be back" u'Came here for a birthday dinner. The price is really for the environment. The service was good and some of the servers were entertaining to interact with. For instance my brother had his coaster on Red but one of the servers came over and said "You know you want this fresh pork" and flipped it over. It was excellent pork.The salad bar and sides were incredibly lackluster. Would not recommend any of the items there. Many of the cuts were tasty but be sure to state how much you want and how well you want the meat done. For instance they give us a huge slab of flank steak which was mediocre at best. The food was above average but it was an entertaining experience.' u"You really have to come up with a game plan when visiting a churrascaria - just remember if you're getting the Rodizio Style Dinner then be cheap with the salad bar so you can optimize on the meats! As such I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we both enjoyed the experience. Salad bar has a lot of great options (including sushi) but I kept my eyes on the prize and got very little servings. The meat selection was great - nearly every type we tried was juicy and bursting with flavor! Definitely try to pace yourself because it's very easy to get full fast. I had to take quite a few breaks before turning my token to the green side.At the end some of the waiters came by to sing my boyfriend happy birthday and even gave us dessert - always a plus point in my book! It's a little pricy if you go for weekend dinner - salad bar and unlimited meat selection puts you at a whopping $65 pp. But I think it's reasonable if it's for unlimited portions of good quality food - if you really want to get the most bang for your buck make sure you come in with a strategy." u"This steakhouse holds up its reputation & is made for Meat Lovers! The salad bar is great with a phenomenal selection of foods ; Calamari exquisite sushi rolls pickled peppers shrimp cocktail smoked salmon stuffed tomatoes greens you name it it's there fixed in some Brazilian spices. The variety of juicy tender meats are out of this world great. The sirloin prime ribs & filet mignon wrapped in bacon were my favorite! But pretty much all the meats were good. I just wish they offered a steak sauce if they did I probably would have been able to eat another 3 ounces. The Fried Bananas! oh my goodness They were Delicious! I couldn't get enough of them. I somehow made room for dessert and tried the flan it was perfectly made the only thing I did not enjoy was the bitter syrup/sugar melted over. I did have a Brazilian mojito I definitely recommend it. The service is outstanding ! Dino (manager) & Iniura were very humorous and placed the double green card on our table after they realized we couldn't fit anymore food! I will definitely go back!" u"Gourmet Salad is really that. Too fancy to decipher what was in them. Restaurant should have name cards for each plate/platter at Gourmet island.Otherwise meats were all great. Waiter carrying the meats were very friendly and insistent. Matri'd was nice and accommodating. Too bad most of us do not have the huge size appetite needed to suffice the price. We really didn't eat a lot for the amount of food that was given."]
171.Melt Shop,[u"I was on my way to Top of the Rock when this place caught my eye. I was hungry (as per usual) and decided to stop in. I was so happy I did. I asked the person taking orders what they'd recommend and I ordered all of it.The Fried Chicken Sandwich their potato tots and their strawberry lemonade. I was starving at the time but I found I couldn't finish it all (a rarity/anomaly in itself). The slaw in the sandwich was perfect as was the grill and the crust on the chicken. There is some spicy mayo in there but it wasn't overpowering which was a good thing.I LOVE this place....Yes go here!" u"Melt Shop is amazing!!! The staff is friendly and efficient there is plenty of clean tables upon which to eat and the food is delicious! They have a wide variety of variations on a grilled cheese sandwich with six types of cheese four types of bread (including gluten free!) and many many toppings. They have a menu of awesome sandwiches from the brains of the owners but you can mix and match and add and subtract all you want to make your own custom experience! Melt Shop also has salads if you're feeling healthy which are quite filling and delicious!Now to discuss the tots. W. O. W. They have three different types: Shop Tots which have parsley and Parmesan cheese on them. Cheesy Tots which have their homemade cheese sauce on them. I am addicted to these particular tots. And Loaded Tots which have their homemade cheese and melt sauces bacon bits parsley Parmesan and jalape\xf1os. These tots can be a meal in themselves!They also have hand spun shakes which is going to be amazing for summer. I highly recommend the Nutella shake. Yes you read that correctly. Melt Shop is a fast and friendly restaurant that serves comfort food. Warning: may cause drowsiness and a giant smile!" u"Not your average grilled cheese! The menu has 11 different sandwiches each cater to a different taste! There's something for everyone. I got the Big Skinny which has: mozzarella grilled mushrooms red peppers tomatoes arugula topped with balsamic on sourdough! The bread really makes the sandwich. It's grilled perfectly just the right amount of crunch yet soft on the inside. The employees were so friendly! The guy even brought my sandwich to me as I got up. The store itself isn't that big but there is an abundant amount of seating perfect for lunch breaks.It is a tad pricey for what it is it was $9 with tax for my sandwich. But in the city what can you expect." u"Ahh I love it  it's so delicious !! I especially enjoyed the cheesy tater tots  sooo good and the chicken sandwich was pure heaven. Can't wait to come back again !!" u'Had a great experience stopping in here for a quick late night dinner. The service was fantastic friendly and fast. I got a gluten free grilled cheese and it was killer! The sear on the grilled cheese was to perfection. Most places barely touch gluten free bread but this place knows how to handle it. Would highly recommend and would go back.' u"Friendly staff cute dining area super clean and they had Sriracha sauce!!My friend and I walked in here after a church service at Times Square Church. \xa0I didn't know what to expect and had no idea what they were serving. \xa0Seriously I'm so happy we came in!What we ordered: Buffalo Chicken sandwich Chicken Club sandwich and loaded tots - all of this was enough to share for two very hungry people.I bit into the Chicken Club and I kid you not I was about to cry. \xa0It was sooooo good! \xa0The sourdough bread was perfectly grilled and the butter ratio was perfect! \xa0The cheese was melted on top of the grilled chicken breast and went so well with the arugula and tomato.. that crunch and every bite hit my soul! \xa0Sriracha wasn't really needed but it wasn't bad.The Buffalo Chicken was pretty much a fried chicken smothered in buffalo sauce and had melted pepper jack cheese in between two slices of buttered sourdough. \xa0It was good but definitely not as good as the Chicken Club (it was the opposite for my friend though!). \xa0I expected this to have a bigger kick but it really needed Sriracha and could use some jalape\xf1os.The loaded tots were pretty good as well. \xa0It's enough to share between two people. \xa0Their bacon was like pretty good quality and wasn't shriveled up like most places. \xa0There was melted cheese and jalape\xf1os on it.The best part of this dinner was that we were stuffed when we left and by the time we arrived back to queens (about 30 min drive) we didn't feel like we were going to explode. \xa0The food seemed to have digested pretty easily. \xa0I really cannot wait to go back and bring my friends with me! \xa0Literally the food was so good it made me wanna cry!" u"First let me get this out of the way. AMAZING staff. They were super friendly and even gave me a recommendation when I asked. I wanted practically everything listed on the board but I eventually went with a staff pick: the Maple Bacon. If bacon's on the menu I HAVE to order it. I think I have a problem.The sandwich included cheddar in addition to the bacon. The bacon was a decent quality and thick cut. It came with brick spread. Everything was on white bread. You can probably swap white for something else but the processed stuff for me please. Thanks. \xa0Because this is Midtown your $7.12 sandwich does not come with a side and sides range from $3-$7. You can be cheap about it and just get a sandwich which is always my MO but on this day I splurged a little. I got the tots. Oh the tots. Jesus H. Chris the tots. They were crunchy on the outside soft on the inside with parmesan cheese and green stuff sprinkled on top. Delicious. I don't think I ate for the rest of the day. I should also add that I ordered and took this to go. I work a few blocks away. Food was still good although the bread might have lost some of its firmness. And oddly enough the container the tots came in did not close. Understandable if you are eating in but if you are carrying out you run the risk of cold tots. Luckily this was not the case as I was close by.I also got a milk shake. Not for me since I am not a glutton and do have some self control but for a colleague. She said it was exactly what she needed on a Friday afternoon and has told me to get it the next time. Only other negative (besides tot containers that do not close) is that they sell their dipping sauce. Yes it's only .$69 but still kinda wack. If I'm paying $7+ for bread cheese and bacon just throw in the sauce yo. There are a few things on the menu that I would love to try so I will be back. Maybe on my way home so when the food coma hits me I'll be on a train and not at work." u"Gave a second location another try - equally maybe more disappointing. Perhaps it was my fault for not checking my order prior to leaving. But I think I shouldn't have to worry if my sandwich would be edible or not. Looked okay from top flipped over the bread was burnt. Solution? My grilled cheese turned into an open faced sandwich. Waste of more money and another meal." u"*traditional grilled cheese (the sandwich was good and the cheese inside was super gooey and rich; I couldn't handle that fondue-consistency like cheese so I just squeezed a lot of it out)*tomato soup (not bad and not too salty like other tomato soups; I wish the soup itself was thicker however since it is thinner the sandwich did a good job of soaking it up haha)Cute spot and I like the seating arrangement here. I like that they have bottles of hot sauce and other condiments available. Nice selection of sandwiches and I would want to dry the sourdough bread next time I go." u"Do you need food that will both entice you and make your arteries feel like they're clogging at the same time? \xa0Then Melt Shop is the place for you! \xa0This branch is located off Times Square on 8th Avenue and offers a nice cozy atmosphere with a relatively open space wood on the walls and comfortable seating that's spaced apart nicely so you're not squished in with strangers. \xa0The counter where you order and pick up food is in the back.The staff was very friendly and answered questions I had due to my lack of familiarity with the menu. \xa0Here's what I wound up having:GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH(Grilled chicken Havarti Roasted Tomatoes Truffle Mayo & Multi-grain Toast)I can say without reservation that this is one of the best sandwiches I've had in ages. \xa0Every ingredient is perfectly prepared. \xa0The chicken was moist the cheese melted just right the roasted tomatoes were sweet but did not overpower the rest of the sandwich. \xa0The Truffle Mayo added an incredibly rich layer of flavor and the crunch of the toast helped balance out the richness of everything else. \xa0I would order this sandwich again any time.SHOP TOTSThese are basic tater tots but they were cooked perfectly. \xa0Crunchy tasty and you can get them with cheese on top which makes them more insane. \xa0You don't need ketchup or anything their flavor is amazing just on their own. \xa0On top of tasty food the prices here are really good for the area. \xa0I'd definitely come back here any time." u"3.5 stars for now. I ordered on postmates and would need to eat more here to actually give a solid review. The Sweet:- Grilled cheese - it was more of a panini but it was grilled and buttered..now who wouldn't want that? If I see truffle on a menu you know I gotta have it. The truffle melt was GOOD. Not overpowering and not too cheesy (i like it like that) with havarti cheese a unique flavor with the arugula and toasted sourdough bread. - Salad - Damn. This vegetarian salad was really good. I couldn't put my fork down and I didn't share with my husband (i usually enjoy sharing food). I don't know what it exactly was that made it so delicious...the caramelized onions? the goat cheese the dressing? the roasted tomatoes? or the grilled mushrooms?...regardless I never enjoyed a salad which brought out the flavors of arugula that much... or maybe it was that I didn't expect to enjoy one from a grilled cheese shop.The Sour:- will have to eat there to know. Delivery i mean obviously leaves a grilled cheese not as hot and warm with melted cheese as you expect but the sandwich wasn't soggy and had a good crisp to it. Planning to hit this up again for some tots a new sandwich and a shake." u'On a random Friday night we wandered into Melt Shop in search of a quick dinner. We were pleasantly surprised in an unhealthy junk food kind of way.The restaurant is set up like a typical fast-food joint. Tables a counter and menu above. The food was a bit more unique - different variations of grilled cheese salads and tater tots - also the obligatory tomato soup.We had:Grilled Cheese Burger - heavy but tastyTruffle Melt - tasty even thought I am not a fan of muenster cheesePlain tater tots - with grated cheese and garlic. Very goodTater tots with cheese - a variation of cheese fries good but heavyFountain Soda Machine that had a ton of different sodas - this was pretty neatAll in all this was a decent dining experience. It was fast and tasty. The bathrooms were clean.' u'One of the most dependable food/services I had on my recent trip to NYC. Ordered a truffle melt and had it delivered to my hotel via Seamless. Yummy food and on time!' u"Cute place with modern yellow decor inside. When I said it was my first time the server/cashier patiently explained the items in the menu and shared what were the customer favorites. +1 in my book for great service. I got the grilled chicken melt and some pink lemonade. Felt nostalgic for younger days while eating my meal. I'd be back again for more fast comfort food." u'Was passing by and decided to grab a quick sandwich. I ordered grilled chicken sandwich which was really good. The bread was so perfectly toasted that I loved it. 1 extra is for the bread! They have a choice of multi-grain bread or sourdough. I took the multi-grain one which paired well with the grilled chicken sandwich. Would love to go back.' u"ZOMG. \xa0This place is the shiz.Try their maple bacon melt and their regular tots. \xa0Much better than cheesy tots.They lost a star b/c it's tough for me to get to. \xa0Hey my reviews my rules." u'I\'m a huge bread and cheese fan so I was really expecting to love this place. I agree with other reviewers that the sandwiches are more panini less grilled cheese. I got the maple bacon sandwich and it was just too greasy for me. It left me with a stomachache. I think maybe it was too heavy on the brick spread. The tots tasted just like the frozen kind they served in middle school so don\'t waste your calories on those. Overall it was just pretty a "blah" and unappetizing meal. I\'ll probably come back and try the truffle melt because it sounds so good and I\'ll update my review if I\'m more impressed next time.' u"I got a grilled cheese sandwich with carmalized onions and a Nutella Milk Shake. Both were pretty good. I'd get it again if I was in the area and in need of a snack and I would recommend this place to other people. The reason why I'm giving this place a 3 is because it just wasn't that special. The Nutella Milk shake was a tiny bit too filling after a while and I thought it was slightly overpriced for almost 5$. The grilled cheese was pretty good but I think it couldv'e tasted a little fresher and overall a little overpriced. I think this place would do a lot better if they offered more for the same price" u"Not what I expected but in a good way. I expected a menu of buttery cheesy greasy grilled cheeses with fries. The good news is that you can get all of that but there's a lot more. From tomato soup And a lean mozzarella melt to an array of salads there's enough variety here for lunch any day of the week. The food is good and I love the concept." u"I always have a wonderful time when I come to Melt Shop. I've tried many of the sandwiches (Chicken Club Burger Melt Truffle Melt Maple Bacon Grilled Chicken) the shakes (oreo and strawberry) and the tater tots. The food here never fails to satisfy my cravings. Each Melt is unique and delicious.The workers are always kind and they greet customers with welcoming smiles. The seating area is also clean."]
97.Havana Central,[u"Came here for lunchPros:- The Cuban sandwich was extremely tasty loved the taste and portion size (huge for $12.95)- The sangria wasn't strong which was fine with us since we get red really easily (loved how they display the drink) - The atmosphere is more on the noisy side but if you get a table near a corner it's quieter - Relatively clean bathroom - Convenient location (close to so many attractions - great for walking off the food)Cons:- We didn't like our waiter - he was a bit pushy and slightly annoyed when we took some time to decide on our meals (we're paying give us our space!)" u"Ordered the garlic chicken. Not good. No flavor in the chicken at all. It tasted like it was heated up and not fresh at all. It was served lukewarm to me. Very dry. Horrible.Waiter had an attitude.You couldn't give me a free meal here after this. I won't be coming back just bad." u"Havana Central I love you but I hate your location. \xa0Usually when I'm meeting a friend from out of town they are staying in the times square area. \xa0I have no idea why anyone would want to be there but I digress..I always choose H.C. because it's right in the Times Square area but it's never crowded during happy hour. \xa0I guess all the tourists are too busy at all the awful chain restaurants in the area or somehow they miss the giant palm tree sign outside. \xa0Their loss my gain. \xa0They have some pretty stellar happy hour prices $5 sangria and mojitos and on the Tuesday I met up with my girlfriend they were $1 empanadas. \xa0These are not small one bite empanadas 2 can easily fill you up.I'm hesitant posting this review because I want Havana Central to remain my private oasis in a very hectic area." u'This place is actually pretty good for being in a really tourist area. The empanadas were yummy and my friend got the seafood paella. The seafood paella was pretty delicious and a huge portion that you might want to share. I ordered the beef and it was pretty delicious as well. I enjoyed the egg on top of the rice. For dessert we shared the sampler. The churro was nice but the tres leches was for sure the highlight of the desserts.' u"The Quick: Mixed experiences a true 3.5 but rounding up since it's in Times Square. Good Cuban food and happy hour specials. The Details: The spot can be hit or miss. Sometimes the food is amazing and the staff is extremely helpful. Other times the meat is dry and the service is slow and aloof. That being said it's one of the best options in Times Square that is not overly touristy. I love the vaca fritta \xa0and the $1 empanadas on Tuesdays at the bar during happy hour. The Details: For the area it's a good price. If you keep drinks to a minimum about $30 per person" u"We had an outstanding time here:) The service was excellent as the Manager Diego and our server Laura did a great job and gave us over the top service! And to make things even better the food was awesome! Don't leave without trying the pineapple empanadas. They are great along with all the food." u"I've been an Elite Yelp Event in their upstairs area....and am currently smacking down some Corporate Catering which everyone in the office (even the pickiest of them!) is still raving about.The service was excellent at the event. The suckling pig was divine. \xa0The empanadas were quite good. \xa0The sauces very nice.The catering set up was stellar! \xa0HIGHLY impressed that both the Mango Glazed Salmon and Chicken in Garlic Sauce were cooked to perfection! \xa0Salmon was moist and flaky and not too sweet. \xa0The chicken was PERFECTLY tender. \xa0The rice and beans were on point. \xa0The Cubanos were cute and hand sized. \xa0The pernil inside was SO good. \xa0Empanadas were a knock out. \xa0Rices were a bit clumpy....but this will happen with mass catering.Would I have liked a little more intensity with the flavor/spice profiles? \xa0Of course! \xa0But it's catering in America from a place that's in Times Square. \xa0Still true to authentic Cuban flavors and good every time!" u'We just left seeing on your feet and saw the sign Havana from afar... \xa0We read the menu from outside and were instantly pleased with the selection and variety of food. \xa0Carrie greeted us at the door with an amazing smile and I felt as if I was home. \xa0The music was at the right volume and she walked us to a perfect table... \xa0And the food... \xa0Really amazing plating as well as flavor.... \xa0Delicious... \xa0I will shout out to the world to come and taste the amazing spices and flavors this establishment has to offer. \xa0Our waiter was simply amazing... \xa0Sebastian was helpful and his personality was spot on..' u'Went here for an event recently and have been in the past (about two other times) and it was great. The chicken empenadas kill me...they are so good. \xa0The margaritas are STRONG and really good...and the staff so wonderful. \xa0I know it could be one of those "kitchy" Times Square places but it really is not. \xa0It\'s pretty darn good food and a great atmosphere. \xa0Oh...for the event there were these MINI FLANS!!! I died a little they were sooooo good.' u"I got a Pina colada in a pineapple. Did you hear me...? I said A PINA COLADA IN A PINEAPPLE. What isn't cool and fun about that. It was pricey ($18) but worth it if your just out for a good time. The menu seems more restricted than the long Island location and the decor isn't as amazing as LI either but still nice. They have a live band (or at least while I was there they did) but if you sit too close to them you will never be able to carry a conversation. The wait staff is very friendly and the food is beyond amazing. I had glazed salmon that came with wilted spinach with garlic saffron rice with blacks beans and squash served on a \xa0bed of yucca. The salmon was cooked perfectly (still moist) the spinach was simple but still flavorful and that has to be up there with the best rice that I have ever had." u"YUM YUM YUM!!came here 2 days outta the 5 we were in NY ... loved each visit ... ordered muddled lemonade cuban sandwich and arroz con camaron cuban sandwich: \xa0now this is how a traditional cuban sandwich should taste like! \xa0juicy soft pulled pork flavorful ham and cheese to add the right amt of saltiness topped w mustard n pickles ... DELICIOUS... we actually tried another cuban spot in hell's kitchen (big mistake) and ended up coming back here ... i have a review on that spot tooarroz con camaron: \xa0simple dish w big shrimp that didn't taste fishy and the saffron rice was AMAZING ... honestly wanted to order some to go lolmuddled lemonade: \xa0i usually don't like drinks like this because they are too syrupy and sweet... BUT these were perfect... you could tell it was made fresh and not some premix with just the right amount of agave added ... REFRESHINGthe only reason they don't get 5 stars are for the beans they serve... we got red and black w our meals but sadly both were bland ... definitely missing the spices to make them flavorful ... however that was not a deal breaker and as previously mentioned this place was good enough that we had to come back twice to get our cuban fix service was good and staff was nice ... has a nice open setting w plenty of room ... great music playing ... if you're visiting NY check this place out" u"Four stars for exceeding my expectations for a Times Square restaurant - and for happy hour. Came with a friend for a quick drink after work around 6p on a Tuesday. There are few things I love more in this world than a good happy hour - and we lucked out.Not only were select drinks $6 (sangria mojitos to name a few) but it was empanada Tuesday and each one was a buck. 1) The Sangria was SO GOOD and definitely packed a punch. 2) The empanadas - choice of chicken or cheese- were HUGE. We had ordered six for the two of us thinking they would be petite dainty happy hour sized empanadas but not so much to our delight.If you're looking for a delicious inexpensive happy hour in Times Square - this is your place!" u'Joanna the bartender is fabulous. She works to satisfy all the customers. The bar is very crowded during happy hour (4-7)m-f. And she is moving those appetizers and drinks with her crew. The mojitos are excellent you get a good buzz. The chicken beef and empanadas are $1.00 on Tuesday. My Delicioso. The avocado salad has a light vinegarette with olives onions and tomatoes. They have a great selection of beers the Cuban Hatuey is light and bold. Great Happy Hour if you are in the area.' u"So far my favorite restaurant Came here on Sunday night and it wasn't as crowded I ordered corn on the cob for apetttizer which was deliciousFor dinner I had churrasco well done. For my drink I had a Pina colada so smooth and done so well. \xa0I want to go again already ." u"A bit in old fashioned style restaurant with cool ambience. Didn't know much about Cuban food in the end I liked them all. Music was great. People including servers in the restaurant were all happy." u"So we happened up this place by chance. I was in town with a shorty who was looking for Puerto Rican food. So we took an uber all the way to East Harlem (or Spanish Harlem whatever is PC for you guys) and went to check this place out.. well the posted hours were a bunch of shit. it was closed and there wasn't too much around it. So I lagged an uber to get back to midtown manhattan.. so this Dominican picks us up. Pretty smooth talking cool ass dude.. we are doing the uber pool thing so we have to go and get another passenger.. she looked like a black chick but I guess she's Cuban. very quiet. doesn't talk during our whole trip but then when shorty and the driver are discussing the differences between Dominican and Puerto Rican food she chimed in. She said she works at a Cuban place close to where we were going (times square) at any rate shorty tool her card and we went the next day for lunch.. I must say their Cuban sandwich was pretty damn tasty..between my food and hers and we had a couple drinks I think it was like $60. not too terribly bad. convenient location near our hotel. and shorty even friended the nice passenger who referred us on Facebook. I forgot her name but she's cool. She just wants a loyal dude that will bring her a large pizza with extra cheese. its the simple things in life." u'This pork (pernil) mofongo is some of the best I\'ve ever had at a restaurant! They obviously don\'t make it Dominican style but the taste is much the same just different set up. I picked up a to-go order and only waited about 5-10mins which is totally acceptable for a night time order. Definitely recommend this spot better than the other "themed" restaurants you find around Times Square for sure.' u'food here was awesome service was exceptional as well. Sam gave us great recommendations and was very personable and attentive the whole time.their paella was delicious and the appetizer sampler was a great choice too.thanks for being so accommodating to a bunch of tourists Sam!' u"The food here is excellent & the service was amazing as well. Their drinks are the best I've ever had at a restaurant. It's located right in the heart of New York City  near Times Square. Such a great place to enjoy a great meal :)" u'First time at this Cuban restaurant. Located in Tines Square. Ordered Arroz Con Polo dish. It was good. The salad & black beans was excellent. Overall good food & the service was great. Enjoyable experience.']
136.Hakkasan,[u"The food is good! Probably the best Asian fushion place I have been to. I definitely think I can say sth about Chinese food or Asian food in general. This place doesn't disappoint. All the dishes are to the point and placed gracefully in the most trending place. The dim sum platter is a must. I got tofu mushroom something also good. It comes with egg fried rice and Bok Choy. The dessert is mango pudding also fresh and not overly sweet. Btw I did restaurant menu for $42 they are pretty good. Because you know most of the time it's just a trap for restaurant week menu. Here you can find all the dishes from their original menu and at lower price.(tasting good 70+ for similar stuff). Anyway highly recommend." u"Fancy place for Chinese food in the city. Food and service was okay. Me and friends came by for dinner during restaurant week. The entrance is definitely easy to miss but you'll see some bouncers standing outside. My friends got there early but i got there a little late and we had to wait for a table because of that.Anyways we were led to our table and they took our orders. Got the \xa0sanpei chicken claypot which was really good. My friends got the spicy shrimp and lamb tenderloin not as impressive as the chicken claypot. Got fried dumplings for appetizers which were okay and got the coconut and mango sago pudding which was okay as well. Overall the price tag is high but it is an experience of sorts i guess. You dress to impress here. The music wasn't that loud when we were there. Just felt like there was something lacking (not sure if it was the service or something else) and felt like we had dinner in a modern night club. \xa0A-Ok would prretty much describe my experience." u'My bougie Chinese family is all about Hakkasan. From its trendy interior to its savory dishes and sublime service I would definitely recommend a visit. Table favorites: Crispy duck salad Jasmine tea smoked pork ribs Hakka pork belly claypot Tofu aubergine and shiitake mushroom claypotHonorary mentions: Hakka steamed dim sum platter Fried soft shell crab with curry leaf and chili Drinks: I am a fan of gin - enjoyed both the body of the Smoky Negroni as well as the bite of the Shiso GimletDessert: loved the Pomegranate & Chocolate Bombe and the Black sesame and chocolate dumplings Enjoy!' u'Being a Chinese myself already set a high bar for Chinese food. Hakkasan solidly surpassed my expectation.Many good drink choices on the menu. The dim sum platters (both vegetarian and regular one) are must-tries! Very delicate in presentation with high quality delicious materials. The giant prawn in spicy curry sauce is another highlight (the spicy curry sauce has a nice kick). Other dishes like Peking duck lamb appetizer and black cod are solid too. Lastly the desserts are unforgettable! I absolutely enjoyed both the chocolate dumplings and the carrot cake!! Just take a look at my photos - Amazingly delicate presentation flavorful yet not too sweet.' u'Every dish. Wow. Dim sum platter a must. The eggplant is such a standard Chinese staple but they have perfected it. What I like most about this place is that the food tastes as good as the presentation. Going to try to go to all their locations before I die.' u'Always a pleasure here. Faves are Vegetarian Dim Sum Platter and Vegetarian Chicken. Modern space beautiful decor and friendly staff.' u"Elegant sophisticated a hidden gem...and actually not that easy to find. You could walk right by and not know it was there-which is kind of cool because once you enter the double doors you descend a long marble hall to be treated by a stunning host staff.The bar and bar seating area are dark and cozy and drinks are creative ( as well as a bit expensive). The dining area is cut into intimate sections so you don't get the feeling like you are in a massive expanse-this is about an experience with friends and food and not to be seen.Menu is well presented and balanced and our waitstaff was super attentive to our dietary interests. \xa0I love it when a waiter asks if they can make suggestions! We opted to order several plates and share-which was perfect for us.We had drinks to start but then ordered a stunning bottle of sake which they kept cold in a cool little carafe which didn't dilute because the ice was kept in a separate compartment.It was a pricey meal in the end but thoroughly enjoyable." u"Dined at Hakkasan during Restaurant Week and was glad to see signature dishes available on the RW menu. Started off with the Hakka steamed dim sum platter (Har gau prawn and Chinese chive dumpling black pepper duck dumpling). Three sauces accompanied them chili in oil (spicy) another red sauce (creamy texture mild) soy sauce). All 3 pieces which were creatively prepared were hearty and actually really good. A lot of flavor was packed into each bite. I did use the sauces too which enhanced the taste. For my main I had Spicy prawns with lily bulb and almond. It came atop a yellow curry paste. All entrees are served with the option of steamed jasmine rice or egg fried rice and plain or garlic bok choy. I ordered the egg fried rice and garlic bok choy. The prawns definitely needed rice to enjoy the curry and again it was really good. I had a taste of my friend's Wok-fried lamb tenderloin in chili bean sauce onions and peppers and it was juicy and tasty. That dish is great on its own if you're a meat eater - don't really need rice if you want to avoid.For dessert I opted for the Caramel cremeux Earl Grey & chocolate gelato. I didn't like it. The caramel had a strange herbal taste which for this dessert combination didn't go well. The gelato was average tasting - texture seemed a little too liquid for gelato. Hakkasan is a dimly-lit sexy dining scene that offers Asian fusion dishes that have potential. It's worth a visit and is a nice destination for the area." u'One of the best restaurants in NYC. The decor is beautiful the place is neat and the service is impeccable.The drinks are the absolute most! The Hakka is good if you like pi\xf1a coladas. However I tried the drinks of my friends and they were an explosion of flavors in one. This are drinks that you might only have one since you really need to savor and appreciate it.The mixed dumpling basket is something else. Perfectly cooked. The lamb wraps. One of the best things on their menu. Perfect!! The duck: comes in slices with the crispy skin on top. Pricey for what it is and its not the best. I would not recommend it. Bbq pork: delicious. Home made macaroons: an inspiration of flavors served on cocoa nibs just the perfect ending. Will definitely come back.' u"Not disappointed but nothing really impressed me given the price tag. The entrance is easy to miss. After the double doors you're met with a long white marble path. I was hoping for a somewhat serene setting however it turned out to be anything but - even the dining hall is divided into small sections. And the music is too loud.The chunk port dish Hakka pork belly claypot should have come with a steak knife or sharp knife; with the butter knife it's difficult to cut into bit size. The waiter said this is what the kitchen has provided; the taste is pretty bland." u'Came here with 2 other friends and loved our experience.We ordered the chilean sea bass duck chow mein stone pot chicken and the colorful dumplings.While everything else was just average the chilean sea bass was AMAZING. ORDER THIS. It was tender and had a great aftertaste. The honey brought out the sweetness and the "fat" of the fish. I can definitely tell that this fish had a lot of oil but it was delicious. Skip the chow meins here. They tasted like the chow mein you can get at chinese takeout restaurants. Our waitress recommended this to us...Service was good though. Our waitress was attentive and helped us split the check. She was also very knowledgeable about the menu.' u"We started off a little bumpy. We had a reservation for 6 but ended up only being 5 which we mentioned as soon as we got there. Nonetheless it took almost 30 mins after our reservation and several trips to the hostess to check before we were seated. We noticed several empty tables in the meantime. As for the food I'm a little surprised it has 1 Michelin star. It was quite good mind you but our group still preferred Buddakan overall. The various dumplings were good and the duck salad was great. The stir-fry squid was a chewy and disappointing. And the fried rice was very vanilla where as the udon noodles with duck were much better. The mushroom side was also average. The highlight was the Peking duck. But at $88 it pricey in my opinion albeit a large portion. I only tried the chocolate Mille-feuille for dessert which was nice. My friends had the chocolate dumplings and greatly enjoyed. The decor and service were both excellent. They had several set menu options which opted out of. They were very pricey and not interesting except for the most expensive. Buddakan has much better options for larger groups." u'Dining at Hakkasan in Manhattan\'s Theater District is more than just an experience - it\'s an exquisite culinary journey through the restaurant\'s innovative dishes that showcase traditional Cantonese cuisine with a modern twist. This year I got to partake in Hakkasan\'s celebration of the Year of the Monkey by attending its Chinese New Year dinner which featured a limited edition menu created by International Executive Chef Ho Chee Boon.Double Boiled Fresh Ginseng and Chicken SoupDesigned with the hope of bringing joy luck and prosperity to the diners the elaborate pre fixe dinner began with a bowl of Double Boiled Fresh Ginseng and Chicken Soup. The soup was an excellent start to the meal as the flavorful broth enriched with ginseng tender chicken breasts bamboo pith and wolfberry warmed my soul.Diced Wagyu Beef &amp; Pine Nut Golden CupThe next course of "Small Eat" included Diced Wagyu Beef & Pine Nut Golden Cup and a selection of Hakkasan\'s signature Steamed Dim Sum Platter. The finely diced juicy wagyu beef and pine nuts were piled on top of lightly fried crispy cup. Beyond the complexity of flavor and texture in the dish I was impressed with the beautiful plating that highlighted natural colors of pomegranate seeds micro greens and flower petals.Steamed Dim Sum PlatterThere were four different varieties of dim sum in the Steamed Dim Sum Platter. My favorite was the Scallop Shumai. Wrapped inside chewy dumpling skin was a plump piece of shrimp and scallop with a scoop of caviar roe on top. The only disappointment in the platter was the Duck & Yam Bean Dumpling; the gravy-like thick sauce on top of the dim sum as well as the combination of mushy yam and salty duck was not pleasing to the mouth.Pipa Duck and Roasted Chilean Sea BassThe shareable "Main" course featured a generous portion of four dishes and fried rice. My favorite was a tie between the Pipa Duck and the Roasted Chilean Sea Bass. The Pipa Duck had beautifully crispy golden skin with juicy albeit fatty meat. The hoisin sauce at the bottom added pleasantly sweet end note. The Chilean sea bass glazed with Chinese honey was so succulent that it just melted in my mouth. I particularly enjoyed the tempura battered mushroom on top of the sea bass.Wok-Fry Lobster Hericium Mushrooms and Scallop &amp; Crab Fried RiceOther dishes in the "Main" course included Wok-Fry Lobster in spicy truffle sauce with asparagus mushroom and carrots and the vegetarian Hericium Mushrooms stir fried with lotus root asparagus and lily bulb in black pepper sauce. The Scallop & Crab Meat fried rice was the perfect accompaniment to the generally salty main entrees.Golden HaloTo sweeten the palate the dinner concluded with Golden Halo an intricate dessert of soy caramel cubed banana with edible gold flakes chocolate truffle and candied peanuts. Oh and don\'t forget about the dust of gold on the plate! At the end of the dinner I also got to write my wish on a gold ribbon to hang in the restaurant and received a farewell gift of Year of the Monkey gold coin as a sign of good fortune. I have a feeling 2016 will be a prosperous year after this delicious Chinese New Year meal at Hakkasan!' u"I had a pretty solid meal here with a friend on a semi busy Thursday night. We started off with drinks by the bar which is long and sleek with a lot of tables and booths in that room. As soon as my friend joined me we were seated quickly. Our waitress was very attentive to begin with but the service \xa0for the rest of the night left more to be desired. As far as the food... The duck spring rolls were perfect to start with. I recommend 2 orders of these if you are greedy like me. I had the corn and crab soup with was delicious. Corn pur\xe9e base with shredded crab throughout. Very delicate highly recommended as well. The one dish I'll come back to get would be the fried chicken with kumquat sauce. It was flavorful light and easy to share. The kumquat was like sweet and sour sauce on citrus steroids. I would put this on any and everything (I mixed some in with my rice). A very bright accompaniment to the chicken. Next in my mouth were the Singapore noodles which was the only disappointment of the meal. But still only a slight one! Flavors were good I just expected a bit more umami. Chicken and crispy fish rice was good but there was a bone in the rice. I guess there could've been worse things but that's definitely a choking hazard when you're shoveling rice down your throat. To complete our meal we had the fanciest piece of carrot cake I've ever eaten. But undernearth the frou frou it was damn good. Everything I had I would recommend. But our waitress had no soul and disappeared on us multiple times. That's just as memorable as the food!" u'Went again on restaurant week - this time with friends. They have definitely stepped up their dessert game! We got the coconut tapioca pudding and chocolate mousse. Both were delicious. Cocktails could still use some work though :)' u"I knew coming into this place that I was going to drop some cash. \xa0Hanging their hat on a Michelin star two doormen for a relatively unmarked and unassuming door and a massive granite lined restaurant. \xa0You can just feel the overhead dollars this restaurant is seeking to cover by their listed price points. Service was on point and even when it wasn't on perfect it was addressed pretty darn quick. \xa0My water was empty twice and I caught the waiter motioning for it to be filled within one minute of it being empty. \xa0Our cocktails were constantly checked on. The price here takes a bit to get over but once you're over that you can thoroughly enjoy almost all of the offerings. \xa0I highly recommend the Grilled Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey. \xa0My wife said it was probably the best fish she has ever eaten. \xa0I saved as much of it for her and did my work on the crispy duck salad which was equally amazing. \xa0The two dim sum sampler platters were good. \xa0I don't know if they were 2-3 dollars per dumpling good but good nonetheless. \xa0The only miss of the night was the dessert dumplings I ordered. \xa0The black sesame and chocolate filling was great. \xa0The strange part was the jasmine and yuzu tea that the dumplings were in. \xa0There were too many flavors that didn't meld well. \xa0The yuzu was very citrusy and the jasmine didn't cut through the acid enough to help carry it through with the chocolate and sesame. \xa0So you had this sharp citrus flavor attacking the sweet and silkiness of the dumpling filling. \xa0I can consider this place a special event possibly once in a lifetime meal. \xa0Given the mass amount of other establishments in NYC offering items along the same thread for a quarter of the price I might opt for them over Hakkasan." u'A step into the mystic blue ambiance engulfing your body and taking your soul into another world. A world of peace and tranquility yet anticipation for something incredible. A world that only exists in Hakkasan -a modern classy Asian fusion restaurant named in a michelin guide for its delicacy in food perfection in service and beauty/elegance in ambiance.Hakkasan is a perfect choice for romantic dates cozy family dinners memorable friends outing and more! Our Uncle D decided to take me and my sister out to an unforgettable and fun-filled night at Hakkasan for Fiona\'s graduation dinner. It sure left a strong impression and lingering feelings from that night because not only were the servers funny friendly and attentive the food and environment were on point.Starting with their besting-selling steamed dim sum platter and fried dim sum was the right way to do it! (Be sure to have a glass of cocktail or wine on hand!) The delicate pieces of colorful and tasty dim sum got our mouth watering and the flavors were light yet flavorful awakening our palettes! The steamed dim sum was soft and warm throughout the entire piece while the fried one was crunchy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside creating a distinct texture in every bite. One of the crispy doughs was sweet and fragrant with a hint of savoriness. Sometimes it\'s easy for the fried dim sum to be rather oily and greasy diminishing your appetite but it was deep fried in very hot oil until the pieces were only crispy and dry from extra oil.Before we go into our favorite dish the peking duck let us mention how carefully designed this place was! We noticed that there was a speaker above almost every table and each speaker was able to block off and cover up the sound of other tables around you yet allow you to chat happily at your table! Don\'t be afraid to spill your secrets to your friends or date because chances are that no one else will be able to hear you!As we mentioned our favorite dish was the Peking Duck! The duck was carefully roasted with precision in which the skin was crispy and the meat was juicy and flavorful. In many occasions the duck is usually sandwiched in a piece of thick fluffy pocket bun but surprisingly it was paired with a slice of thin soft mandarin pancakes creating the perfect balance among the ingredients without overshadowing the delicious succulent piece of duck. This dish was HEAVENLY!The asparagus and udon noodles were well-seasoned so the tastes were not bit disappointing. However being Asians we were able to taste that the dishes were lacking "wok air" so we hypothesized that the dishes were not cooked with a wok. We asked our waiter for confirmation but to our surprise they used a wok! What was lacking was the "fire air." Without a strong flaming fire the dishes lacked certain flavors giving them a one dimensional character.' u"Restaurant week bought me to Hakkasan. The service at the front desk was prompt and we were seated as soon as our entire party arrived. They seated us very close to the kitchen and we didn't care too much for the smell of boiling seafood but they couldn't move us as they were fully booked. For a place that charges as much as Hakkasan I feel they should pay more attention to things like this. We started off drinking the infamous Smoky Negroni while the process of preparing it was very entertainingI didn't care much for the drink itself the aftertaste was too strong for me. The table also got a few China mules which they enjoyed. We got both the steamed as well as the fried dumplings and that's where the magic is I guess. They have the best shrimp dumplings har gau I think it's called I have ever had. Absolutely delicious. The fried dumplings were also pretty great. We even got a steamed veggie dumpling platter for the table and it was simply out of this world. They gave us this really yummy chili sauce with the dumplings that was the bomb don't miss it. For main course we tried the tofu aubergine claypot the pork tenderloin and chicken claypot everything was delicious. \xa0The egg fried rice is really yummy. For dessert there was tapioca pudding which I was not a big fan of and chocolate mousse which was again spectacular. They are very good with dietary restrictions and allergies. The service is good. They also have a wall of wishes they ask you to write your wishes for the new year and tie it up on this wall. Nice touch. I am in love with their dumplings but I guess I am not going to run back to this place anytime soon." u"Wow where do I start beautiful venue I even enjoyed the walk to the host stand and the offering of wanting to check in my bag extremely hospitable latenight bite wished I could remember my servers name but he had an amazing looking fro outstanding waiter pin pointed everything \xa0on the menu big on recommendations top dishes were the squid  crispy fried chicken and sweet and sour pork I can't wait to go back for more and this time make some room for desert cocktails were great lychee martini my favorite . Thank you for the amazing experience!" u"Exquisite food with a presentation of pure class.Hakkasan is what you expect from a top of the line Asian restaurant. \xa0A robust menu of select dishes each designed to be shared will tantalize your taste buds as excellent service enhances your dining experience. \xa0I sampled a wide selection of dishes each with their own distinct flavors.The crispy duck salad is a surprisingly refreshing appetizer that combines earthy greens with the natural fattiness of duck. \xa0It's a dish that should feel heavy but doesn't fill you up and leaves you wanting more.The fried soft shell crab with curry leaf is a flavorful explosion of tender juicy crab with spicy curry. \xa0The texture of fried crab and some sort of shredded veggies gives the dish a satisfying crunch but the crab to other ingredient ratio is lower than expected considering the crab should be the signature part of the dish.The salt and pepper squid was the only part of this meal that I'd consider lackluster as most of the squid flavor due to how over fried it was. \xa0The hakka dim sum platter was gone in a flash as the colorful assortment of dumplings were picked clean by my party. \xa0I was only able to taste the duck dim sum which was squishy and hard to grab with my chopsticks but proved worth the effort as the warm and gooey texture enhanced the smooth and almost creamy duck. \xa0The crab and sweetcorn soup might sound like a bizarre combination but the sweetness of the corn pairs perfectly with the saltiness of the crab making the dish a treat for the palate. \xa0I could enjoy this soup at the start or the end of my meal.The spicy prawns were not as hot as I expected and instead exploded with flavors of chilies and curries. \xa0The prawns themselves were meaty and will require several bites for people with smaller mouths. \xa0The sweat and sour pork tenderloin with pomegranate is the closest dish to something you'd find in a Chinese takeout yet it's flavors make it a delight to eat as the mix of the sweet and sour sauce combined with the tartness of the pomegranates make for an eye opening experience.The crispy chicken in lemon sauce was good but it's more texture than anything else as the flavor of the chicken paled in comparison to the other main courses. \xa0If you are ordering the crispy chicken I recommend eating it first or else the other dishes' flavors will overpower the chicken. \xa0The seafood fried rice is heavily flavored with curry powder (a popular spice in this establishment) and not lacking in shrimps scallops and squid. \xa0Very filling and a great side dish to go with the rest of your meal.For dessert I sampled the black sesame and chocolate dumplings. \xa0In addition to a fantastic visual presentation the dumplings pack a wonderful surprise. \xa0Before serving our waiter pours sweet yuzu tea into the bowl of dumplings. \xa0Once the dumplings have soaked some of the tea's flavors I popped one into my mouth tasting the sweetness of the dough tea and berries placed on top. \xa0Once I bit down I felt an intense explosion of rich warm chocolate rush into my mouth. \xa0The sudden shift in flavors took me aback at first before I became overwhelmed in tasty bliss.Every dish was beautifully presented and our server was of the utmost professionalism. \xa0Next time I feel like truly splurging on a meal you'll find me at Hakkasan."]
31.Istanbul Kebab House,[u'Real good food friendly and generous people! The owner even gave me dates for free! How about that treatment for a first time customer! The lentil soup was real good! The falafel and baba ghanouch were tasy! The sandwich had so much meat though! So if you dont want that make sure and tell them ahead..!' u"Don't order delivery from here. \xa0I ordered through Delivery.com and was supposed to receive my food within 45 minutes. \xa0I called the restaurant after 1.5 hours to ask where my delivery was. They told me that because my building requires delivery people to carry ID the delivery person couldn't bring my food. \xa0He tried to tell me that the delivery person called me multiple times - but my call log has NO missed calls from today. \xa0He then told me that it was my fault that the delivery was late because my building requires ID.The food arrived after 2 hours - cold greasy and disgusting looking. \xa0It instantly went into the trash. \xa0Never again." u"Unprofessional message I received from the owner in response to my review:Hello Zee PSorry about late \xa0delivery service we will try our best to make you and all our Customers happy please visits us for dine in my name is Umid I will try to give you better service possible Thank you for your business we love you :)We love you? I don't think so." u"Ran into this establishment on a rainy day in NYC w/o an umbrella. Decided to stay here for lunch with 3 other friends to try out Turkish food. Seating is kinda congested but that's normal for NYC I guess. Food wasn't anything special but by no means was it spectacular or worth coming back to be brutally honest. If you're in the area and need/want halal food then I'd defiantly say to try and give it a shot. Reason it's 3/5 is because of the staff and pricing. I wouldn't call it expensive but the plates were not worth the $$ in terms of portions/quality (in my opinion). Also a very un-attentive staff seemed like asking them for anything was such a painful process. Sauces refills extra plates etc seemed to drive these people nuts. I would normally understand that some people are burdensome on the staff but the things we were missing were included as part of our meal...so..?" u'They are so frendly and the lamb gyro was so delicious and fresh. This restaurant deserves 5 stars. And they served a complimentary dessert.' u'Great place gyro is yummy kazandibi is the best. Thanks for the wonderful staff. The restaurant is located in a great area. I will come back. Recommending to everybody.' u"Food is so fresh and affordable the staff is super friendly I don't know why I don't come here more often but moving forward I'll make sure to come at least once a week!" u"After 10pm in Hell's Kitchen can be slightly harder than you think to find a decent meal (unless you want a burger). Wanted to try something new and this Kebab House has been around a while - plus practically empty on a Saturday night.Lots of options on the menu so hard to choose just one. Settled on a Lamb Shish Kebab sandwich on turkish bread ($9). Sandwich took about nine minutes to make while I waited in the small hallway for take out. The bread they use in the sandwich is warm soft and holds all the ingredients fairly well. The meat is crisp not as juicy as I'd like though not quite rubbery. One issue is that all the lettuce and condiments detract from the meat of the sandwich and the sauces provided don't provide much help. Had to add my own hot sauce to give the kick it needed.For a late night meal it satisfies. Good for delivery and take out if you have a few minutes." u'I\'ve been eating lunch here for nearly five years and have always had consistently good food. \xa0It\'s a small cafe (6 tables) run by a crew of friendly Turkish fellows. \xa0While most customers use it for take-out (presumably they take food to their desk and further enjoy extending their work day) I try to find time to sit and enjoy my food.THE INTERESTING PART OF MY REVIEW CAN BE SKIPPED. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RESTAURANT!Interesting part starts here.As it turns out I have a little street cred when it comes to Turkish food. \xa0Several years ago I went to visit my brother who was living in Turkey. \xa0I had become disillusioned with my career and decided to quit my job and re-assess my future. \xa0I convinced my lady friend (we had been dating long distance for a few months) to join me. \xa0 We spent two months with backpacks journeying through Turkey Greece Yugoslavia (back-in-the-day) and Italy. \xa0Four of those eight weeks were spent on Turkish soil.We saw half the country and probably slept in 10 hotels homes and campgrounds. \xa0Everywhere we went we saw people transporting carts of fresh tomatoes onions peppers olives fruit and nuts. \xa0The concept of farm-to-table is a way of life for most of Turkey including Istanbul and other large cities. \xa0At one point we became quite ill and (probably rightly) assigned the blame to a very tasty lamb sandwich in Adana. \xa0In spite of that "life event" I\'ve never avoided this type of food.Turkey is incredible as a tourist destination. \xa0Over those eight weeks and the four we spent crossing the USA we never found a friendlier culture. \xa0My companion had to deal with the fact that answers to her questions were directed to me. \xa0A factor that changed merely by going to nearby Greek islands where women were running businesses and shouting at men!In spite of this "slight nuance" we were confident that we could arrive in the center of a town leave our backpacks in the middle of the dusty road and return four hours later to find that someone was protecting our goods - of course we never tried it but it sure seemed that way. \xa0On the other hand when shopping for hand-made carpets one can find oneself dealing with a professional sales person (ok sales man) who is more than happy to ask you for three times the price he is willing to accept.So I am quite fond of Turkish things - caveat emptor. \xa0Interesting part ends here.END OF THE INTERESTING PARTThe bread served with the spreads is amazingly good. \xa0The spreads are amazingly good as well. \xa0I like the lamb shwarma platter or sandwich. \xa0The hot and white sauces are supreme.Along with the 6 tables the decor consists of a counter cash register small tapestries and a few framed pictures.Another interesting part. \xa0While in Rome while eating lunch in a much nicer restaurant than Istanbul Kebab House we were robbed of our money passports and flight tickets the day before we were due to return to NY. \xa0My lady friend became Mrs G shortly after our return to the USA. \xa0Still is. \xa0Always will.' u'This is my first time trying food here .. great enviroment .. quiet and friendly . My kebab was great although the bread was too soft my taste . The dessesrt was delish ! Although a mediterranean food place they had mexican doing the wraps .. kindda of odd but all good . I will be back !' u'Hummus was tasty we ordered a lavazza bread sandwich the texture of meat was very tender both chicken and lamb although I would have preferred a spicier sauce it was still good food.' u"Came here twice for lunch. \xa0It's delicious and the price is great. \xa0Tried the chicken and the lamb sandwiches and they were both great. \xa0Definitely coming back for some more." u'Nice little place to grab turkish food. I was visiting Manhattan and came across this place by accident. To my surprise they serve the turkish doner sandwiches. Just like what i saw in a documentary from a joint in Berlin. So i HAD to give it a try. Can i say that the portions are huge? I ordered a lamb doner sandwich in turkish bread and a big portion of chicken shawarma. All that for 26$ tips included!!! We had enough food for two days! Its was what we needed for our trip back to Montreal. The menu is quite extensive but all the items seems so good! The person that greeted me was very nice and helpful. The food reminded me of Amir restaurants in Montreal. Opens late too!' u'Great fresh delicious food !!!Ordered the appetizer plate it was so fresh and delicious We also ordered lamb and chicken dinner incredible!!!' u'Tasty Chicken shish Kebab with homemade turkish bread \xa0Great Service \xa0good food and nice waiter .' u'Great Kebab delicious and tender. We have one Chicken Shish kebab and one Chicken/Lamb Shish kebab combination the meat is so well cooked at the right level. So it is soft and full of the ambrosial aroma of roast.' u"I really wanted to like this place. Especially since it almost looks like a hole in the wall place - those are usually the places with the best food. Unfortunately this was not the case. I ordered the lamb adonis and the gyro and both were dry. It tasted like burnt end bits. That or it tasted like they microwaved the meat a few times before serving it. Surprisingly the chicken soup was pretty good. The one item out of everything I ordered that I didn't expect to be good actually was. They use real chicken (not canned broth or bouillon cubes) because there are lots of shredded chicken bits at the bottom. So if you're looking for chicken soup this place is a pretty good option in this area. But if you're looking for good Turkish food you should probably search elsewhere." u'Great kebabs and salad! Nice Turkish tea! We ordered lamb Adana and chicken shish!! Prompt service!! Short wait time!! Kazamdibi (like caramel flan) is awesome!!!' u"Highly recommend this place. Food was exceptionally delicious it's almost the same what you will get in high priced restaurants. Sauces are must try. Excellent place when you want to eat something delicious" u'Very clean food very polite and friendly staff and plenty of meal options. Would definitely recommend it for tourists. We tried many restaurants in New York in our first and second days and the were not that good but this restaurant is a must go one.']
14.The Halal Guys,[u"Got to experience the Legendary Halal Guy's. There food is definitely what people are always talking about. \xa0So delicious and the white sauce and red sauces are bomb!I came here twice both times it was so good omg. It's crazy how many reviews this location has. And how many people say so many good things about them. People are right about this place. They are amazing and when I come visit NYC again I will come back to Halal Guy's for sure!!!Food is 10 out of 10 my God!" u'Cheap filling and gigantic in terms of portions; what more could you ask for? Perhaps a flavor that doesn\'t have such a high diminishing marginal return and somewhere to sit that isn\'t the street but one could also argue that these are all part of The Halal Guys experience.It was what I was led to expect from the name I suppose - there was Halal food and there were guys. The combo platter was a bit dry and bland; it is after all fundamentally meat and rice. The ranch-like albeit delicious white sauce fixed that. I have yet to come across a condiment called "white sauce" that I don\'t enjoy whether it be at a Japanese restaurant or The Halal Guys. The hot sauce on the other hand was very different from what the definition of "hot" based on the sensitive Western palate was leading me to expect because it was actually FLAMING. I ended up emptying the entire packet into my serving but for real it\'s spicy.Overall though the food was good and due to the fact that any given platter is pretty much 90% carbohydrates and protein it was extremely filling. In my opinion one platter could be two meals. The more than reasonable pricing is an added bonus making The Halal Guys an experience that is worth it in the end.' u'For 7 bucks u get a meal that can feed u for 2 days! I crave their food.... I really do! Despite having dinner reservations that same night I inhaled their food! I was only supposed to eat half and save the rest for later but by the time I gained back my consciousness I had already almost finished it! Also they are fast.... i paid 7 bucks and with in seconds i had my food. They are THAT efficient!' u"This is definitely a New York staple. Lazy to cook? Halal Guys. Came out of work late? Halal Guys. A little broke from paying rent but still wanna have a good meal? Halal Guys. Just got out of the club? Halal Guys. Street food feels? Halal Guys. Friends visiting from out of state? Halal Guys. Just because? Halal Guys.At any point in time there will be a line; a long line at that. It won't matter because a) it is worth the wait; and b) them Halal Guys are pretty fast so you won't be waiting that long. You can never go wrong with Combo over Rice. $7 for a meal plus leftovers for the next day. Surprisingly leftover Halal Guys is actually pretty good (don't judge). Always put some of that amazing white sauce. If you like spicy don't be too confident and slather a lot of the hot sauce. I have made that mistake and I could barely eat my food. Just add if you need more." u"It was a huge portion of food for only $7. Way too much for 1 person. Tried the mix of lamb & chicken plate (bowl) and it was really good! A little bland. The white sauce was like ranch dressing and the red sauce tasted like BBQ sauce to me and I didn't like it at all. A little heat would've been welcome. Huge lines at 10pm on Friday night but there are 3 stands very close together so you have a good chance of getting food within about 10 min.If you're looking for cheap eats that'll fill you up and isn't a hot dog pretzel or pizza this is the place to go." u"Still 3.5 starsIt's been over a year that I have tried the Halal Guys. I came here last week and got the falafel platter this time since I was craving for falafels. The white sauce is still pretty amazing but the food is still OK in my opinion. I also thought that they didn't give that much rice this time too.There was a line when I came on a Sunday afternoon and probably waited on the line for 10 minutes. BTW I killed some time by playing Pokemon GO and caught three Pokemon: two Geodudes and one Shellder. :)" u"I love these guys! They're worth every penny. It's not a wonder why people go to their stand and line up. It's good for any time of the day. Food is cheap big portions and taste oh so good. I keep going back to them. I even have cravings but I always stop by when I'm in NY." u"Everyone should come here at least once. I got the combo sandwich with white sauce. It was tasty and smelled AMAZING. But I imagine it's not very healthy. Was a lot of food for $5 and I only ate half. Honestly I don't know if I'll be back unless I randomly am craving it but I'm happy I went. The line moved very fast and the food was fresh and hot." u"Decent chicken over rice in the centre of NYC. I did enjoy the food I received from the Halal Guys and the value on offer is certainly good. However I guess I am slightly disappointed given the massive hype I had heard about the food before trying it. It's always difficult to live up to huge expectations. I have had similar food from several food trucks in the city and can't say that Halal Guys is significantly better than the others.In short the food is good the value is good but is it so good that it's worth the queue and the cold service? Probably not." u"Hungry after being at the Top of the Rock for several hours I Yelp'd what was close by and on my way to the Hilton and this popped up. Sounded good to me so off I went in search of foodie riches. Yep it was every bit as delicious as everyone else has mentioned. Not only that but it was generously portioned and CHEAP! Two things I do adore in my little frugal heart.For a plate of food that cost around $7 it lasted me some 2.5 meals. Good flavor quick service delicious (not dry!) rice tender well-seasoned meat and when I added that white sauce with a touch of the red spicy sauce? Sheeeeet I was in culinary heaven. I'm going to be honest... Writing this right now is making me hungry but unfortunately I live quite a bit far from NYC. The food really is something I miss so much.It was a great way to jump start my four days in the City and my mini culinary tour I took while there. Seriously some of the best street food I've ever eaten." u"My favorite part about NYC is having Halal Guys! I never thought lunch/dinner from a cart that is located on multiple streets in this city would be so heavenly. I adore the menu that keeps it short and sweet everything is all packed with flavors and freshness. For $7 for a entree that will last me at least 2 meals is a win! I love the gyro platter and I definitely use 2 of the white sauce packets. Mix it all up with the rice and it's so good. I ended up taking back 4 boxes with me to Atlanta. I was glad it made it well through security at the airport. I'm sure everyone does it though. It was meals for the week that got me excited for lunch at work. I will make a goal to eat here at least twice or more every time I visit NY. Cannot wait for the Atlanta location to come this fall 2016." u"The Halal Guys! Finally got to try it and I am in love with their food!I got chicken and it was so delicious perfect amount of meat and rice ratio and the veggies & bread on the side.Chicken was well seasoned and not dried. And perfectly cooked/seasoned rice!The best part was the white sauce. Mixed all together made it perfect combination. Just be very careful with how much of the red hot sauce you put in... The first time I didn't know it was super super super spicy (I love spicy but really this hot sauce is no ordinary hot sauce). I put so much hot sauce my mouth was literally on fire. Every one bite I take I drank almost a full glass of water. The second time around I learned my lesson and added the hot sauce just enough on the side of the bowl.They also have BBQ sauce to add to your bowl of food if you want.You can also ask for their small packets of sauces to take home with you if you don't want to put the sauces on your food there.There will be a long line of wait on weekend nights...but goes pretty fast since the food gets ready fast.My friends and I went on Thursday night and the wait wasn't long at all.Saturday night the line was kind of long...waited for about 15-20 minutes.I can not wait for them to open in my area!!!" u"Halal Guys is the best; not too much more needs to be said. Have been coming here for a while now since college and it never disappoints. \xa0I always get the combo over rice ($7). \xa0Waiting on line while your stomach groans is one of the most unique experiences so it's something you must do if you're visiting.As for the food itself what can you say? \xa0They give you a lot of food (although a little less than they used to a while back) and it's on another level for real. \xa0The Halal Guys platter is far and away the best cheap platter you can get in the city; nothing else even comes close." u"I absolutely love this spot!!!!! You need to try it out if you're going to New York! I always always get this at 2am or anytime really. Its super delicious and well worth the wait. Sometimes the long is kind of long (like ~20 people) or sometimes there is no one in line. You need to get the regular chicken and rice-the chicken is so soft and not dry at all! The salad is my favorite part since its very fresh lettuce and yummy tomatoes. I also love the orange rice and love to mix it all up and eat it! I definitely put the white sauce on and I have the spicy on the side. The spicy sauce is REALLY spicy--don't be a fool and put it on all your food. Love the owners/managers. They are so sweet and really friendly with me and my friends :)I'll definitely come back!" u'I honestly did not expect this to be this good lol I know....have faith right?! I ordered really early they were just starting the cook the chicken when I placed my order. I grabbed the combo with chicken and beef. They Halal guys were kind of....well....."what do you want?" Ummmm I want a pita why else would I be talking to you?! LolThe one kind one did smile and prepare my meal. He even offered some hot sauce which I opted for. OK so don\'t think I\'m gross lol but I didn\'t end up eating this until the end of the day maybe like 7 hours later lol....we ended up getting sucked into the Annual Street market and I walked around all day with this pita wrapped in foil. Here is why it was awesome though! It was still warm....and it tasted AMAZING! The flavors of the chicken and beef were potent but not overwhelming. I thought it would maybe be greasy but it wasn\'t. It did need a little more veggies( lettuce tomatoes) but it was still very good. The meat was definitely present in every bite! And the pita was thick and crispy around the edges. The sauce burned the crap out of my tongue & and my stomach lol. But it was worth it it was very good. Next time I\'m getting it on the side heart burn in NYC is not fun.....' u'One word. Very disappointed. Ok so I\'ve been DYING to go.. Wait that\'s two words ok whatever. Anyways I\'ve been DYING to go to halal guys because I absolutely LOVE halal food and lamb. BUT when I arrived I was told their famous lamb over rice has long been gone and they only offer beef and chicken now. I was already disappointed at that point because all the other "regular" halal carts offer lamb but NONETHLESS I still BELIEVED THAT halal guys was gonna be like a "LIFE CHANGING" kind of food that differs from all other halal carts I was soooo wrong gurl.. It\'s not that the platter was bad it was just that honestly it doesn\'t taste anything extraordinary and the beef and lamb was cooked.. Over cookedA little TIP: My dad was also with me and we shared the same platter and at first I was really mad because I wanted us to get our own. But omg girl I am so glad we didn\'t because we both struggled to finish the whole platter not because we were full but because it simply just tastes bland. WHY IT EVEN TASTES A LITTLE GOOD? WHITE SAUCE. Without the white sauce it would be very very bad. I wouldn\'t be coming back again I am very very disappointed and will stick to other regular halal carts which I love even more.' u"The halal guy is simply the best late night food there is. I've eaten here many many times and go with the lamb over rice. I arrived around midnight after walking from Madison square garden and I was starving sweating and super thirsty. I got the combo of lamb and chicken over rice. I was so happy to see the sauces on the side so I could douse my dish with white and red sauce. The red sauce is so good but already being hot out combined with coming from a concert and the walk over... I also downed two gatorades and a soda. Still it was completely worth it. Definitely a must try!" u"If you are a tourist and you're wondering if you should the answer is YES. if you're not the answer is still YES. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. The meats are tender and soft well flavored and made piping hot right in front of you. Watch out because if you stand too close some flying meat might come at you. The only thing that might be a no is the hot sauce... Because one drop is enough. Two drops might kill ya. Best halal in my life and soon to be yours." u"Man this stuff is filling!Alright alright I came over to New York just in time to try Halal Guys before it completely takes over California. As soon as I left the airport in San Francisco the San Jose Halal Guys had just started their grand opening so woooo beat the crowd. I ain't about to wait 2-3 hours for a serving of street food. Just like everyone whose ever heard of Halal Guys I know their food comes with a huge reputation for being the best halal food ever. At my alma mater we have an amazing food truck on campus so I had to compare their food to Halal Guys.Waited about 15 minutes in line for my food at the nearest food stand I could find. BTW it's cash only so don't wait in line only to forget your cash at home.I asked for a chicken over a rice.Damn they prepped it real quick. Well they do make huge batches at a time so that's how it's done. I didn't really see any nearby cafes to sit at so we settled for benches along the sidewalk. Opened up my halal guys to see mostly dried shredded chicken on top. Okay I guess I'll add some white sauce for taste. Mixed it. Took a bite. Not even close to being as good as I expected. Guess I needed all 3 of the sauce packets they gave me. I did try a bit of the hot sauce out of curiosity and good thing I didn't use it. This hot sauce is HOT! Like jalapeno hot. Overall its a pretty hefty and tasty meal on its own. I mean I couldn't even finish it in one sitting. At UC Davis Shah's Halal Food tastes so much better in my opinion. Maybe I should've gotten the lamb over rice?Halal Guys your food is good but not mind blowing good." u"Probably one of the best halal food carts I've ever had in NYC! Here's all you need to know:- Must visit while in NYC.- Chicken/Lamb over rice.- Go white sauce crazy!- Get some hot sauce if you love pepper sauce!- The lines move quick and for the price its worth it!Stop reading this and go snatch up a combo meal already! Enjoy folks and maybe I'll catch ya late night on the line for some banging halal eats!"]
149.Meson Sevilla,[u"If you've ever been to Spain then you will know the food in this place is authentic!! \xa0My husband and I go \xa0at least once a month as a treat. \xa0We order tapas and a pitcher of sangria. \xa0Everything on the menu is delicious and well prepared. \xa0The staff are \xa0warm and friendly and the service is top notch. \xa0The place is a hidden jewel." u'The problem outside of NYC is that too many restaurants that advertise Spanish cuisine only serve tapas. \xa0Meson Sevilla -- in business for over twenty years -- serves the old school dishes that I love.My husband and I are very predictable. \xa0He always gets some kind of seafood and I stick with my tried-and-true: pollo villaroy (the Spanish version of fried chicken with b\xe9chamel sauce.) \xa0T chose mariscada -- a seafood/shellfish medley with choice of sauce. \xa0Garlic -- al ajillo -- was lovely.Two people can split a starter salad -- sold a la carte -- and one large pitcher of sangria is plenty for four people. \xa0(My daughter and her boyfriend were with us.) \xa0We had tres leches cake for dessert and it was moist and delicious. \xa0Truth be told I could have devoured the portion on my own without sharing.Last time in we went to a crowded noisy Spanish restaurant in the village. \xa0Meson Sevilla is quiet sedate ... and in my opinion pretty darned good!' u"Meson Sevilla is a small restaurant loaded with massive flavors. Microscopic restaurants can take a major wrong turn if they don't have the right elements. With that said I particularly just like those that meet MY requirements: 1.Intimate 2. Soft lighting- and for the love of God- no fluorescent bulbs and 3. Good interior of art and/ or furniture. In addition to my endless list of requirements- food definitely has to pop.Meson Sevilla has all the arsenal you need. We ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria which was sweet and strong and from tapas to main course to dessert food on my book was an A+++.Flamenco music was popping in the background and the ambience couldn't have been more/less Spanish. Spain's history has always captivated me. Spain is filled with North African culture beautiful music that is fully inspired by the Arabs food Religion and beautiful Mosques. With that essential piece of Spanish history aside Meson Sevilla was all that and a bag of chips.And by the way it was a real pleasure being served by a Spaniard (I don't know but to me it just added a little authenticity)." u'Great place for an authentic experience of Spain! Just off the tourist path this place is a great place for a post-theatre drink and dinner. I sat at the bar and enjoyed the jamon sliced from the bone along with a glass of Spanish wine. Definitely a great place to spend an evening in NYC. Quiet and authentic a great find!' u'I loved the jamon pan y tomate appetizer. The croquetas were tasty and the empa\xf1adas were very good with quality seasoned beef. The champagne sangria was amazing! I am someone who likes a buzz without the hardh flavor and this bubbly mamacita was so sweet and refreshing that I could not help but to order a second half pitcher! The paella was just ok as we did not taste any saffron or seafood flavor. Overall nice tapas but the sangria is what increased my rating from a solid 3 to a giving 4 stars.' u"A tiny hidden gem in the heart of the theater district! I've been here a couple times already once with my wife and once with friends (one of whom is from Spain). Both times did not disappoint. I HAD to come back. The tapas is excellent as well as the service. Even when the place is packed the quality does not take a hit. Perfect for before theater dinner. Everything on the menu is authentic and well made. Todo Bien~!" u'Good service & good food. They automatically add a Tip so make sure you demand good service at times may be a little lacking. Our 2nd visit here & all and all a good meal.' u"Had the arroz valenciana it's a typical paella but with Spanish chorizo. I like how the flavors meshed perfectly but wished that the texture of the arroz was a bit more chewier instead of being on the greasy end. Overall the spice was amazingly incorporated." u'A truly excellent restaurant. \xa0The price fix menu has a multitude of choices covering literally everything from soup to nuts. \xa0Serving size is quite decent and the fact they include a glass of wine with the selections is unusual for a NY restaurant. \xa0My wife and I loved this place and will frequent it again.' u"Excellent food and great service. \xa0 The restaurant is cozy but the space is tight for tables of two. \xa0The waitstaff was very accommodating though and comped our drinks due to cramped-table issues.Portions are huge and prices are very reasonable. \xa0 My husband had a sea bass dish that was seasoned very well (a bit of a kick) and a very big portion. \xa0I had a chicken dish that was just ok but the ambianceSangrias and restaurant staff make this place a '5'" u'Visited here three weeks ago. Sangria was wonderful. Service was awesome. Very good food. Highly recommend. We had the paella empanadas and stuffed mushrooms. All were delicious.' u"Good food and reasonable price but the atmosphere is kind of depressing. It's not dirty but dated and worn. The tapas are very good. I tried the grilled octopus which was seasoned with paprika. I like paprika but did not like the combination with octopus. Maybe its an acquired taste. The grilled artichoke was excellent. The caldo gellego was a hearty soup with big chunks of chorizo and some other meat.The wines were below average and service was ok nothing special." u"So I am torn here. If I could give it a 3.5 I would. Let me explain:The Appetizer plate of Jamon Serrano Chorizo and Queso Manchego was excellent. Very very good and worth the hefty price of $24. I give this plate a 4 star rating would've been 5 if it weren't so pricey.The paella was really disappointing for one big reason. They didn't use saffron in it. The portion size was great lots of sea food but missing the crucial ingredient to make it real authentic paella. That was disappointing." u"Overall 3.5 stars: Not perfect but an enjoyable experience (for someone not exposed to Spanish food as much). TAPAS:--Stuffed Mushrooms - Decent but a bit on the smaller side especially if sharing with multiple people.--Grilled Octopus - HEAVY handed with the paprika seasoning and I was coughing up the spice mid-meal to show for it but I'm a fan for my first stab at this classic. My Spanish friend says it was decent but better ones exist out there so you can decide for yourself if you're reading this.ENTREE:SOLOMILLO AL MESON - Why wouldn't you want a hearty bacon wrapped filet mignon topped with cheese and mushrooms?? I asked for it to be cooked medium but came out more medium well. Nevertheless still tender and this dish could be 5 stars alone. It comes with a side of steamed veggies but nobody has stomach space for that when you have the main course to attend to.DESSERT:--Our table ordered the Tiramisu Chocolate Cake and Flan to share. The serving sizes are smaller than expected taste was just ok but everybody was full at this point." u"Not much to look at but the food is great!Came here with some friends and as I descended a few steps off the street I was thinking I might have made a mistake choosing this place. \xa0But we were hungry and we were there so we went for it.I'm glad we stayed. \xa0The food was very good. \xa0We had a bunch of small dishes and the standouts were the garlic shrimp and the baby artichokes. \xa0Both so good. \xa0We also loved the patatas bravas. \xa0The spicy sauce would be great on chicken wings! \xa0Oh and the filet things. \xa0I don't know what they were but the meat was great!Service was a little hit or miss but they were nice especially the kind and handsome young bus boy who seemed genuinely concerned when my friend joked that she didn't really like anything as he cleared away our completely empty plates! \xa0Bless his heart.The bathrooms are tiny and kind of grungy and the place hasn't been redone since Sheena Easton was topping the music charts but I'd definitely come back. \xa0It would probably be good to sit at the bar and have a few small plates." u'4th time here. \xa0Consistently good food. \xa0Hot octopus albondigas lengua and baby artichokes were well flavored and delicious at the bar this time. \xa0Good strong pours too. ;-).' u"Was in NYC for a business conference and decided to take a few of my co-workers to this fine little place on restaurant row. Let me just say if you are in the mood for a glass of wine or beer and a huge portion of Paella this is the place to go. Warm bread plenty of tasty appetizers and a huge menu filled with tapas Spanish and Italian fare. The Paella was well cooked and included a large amount of seafood and flavorful saffron infused rice. Dinner for 3 was just over $100 (in NYC no less!) so it's way affordable and the ambience is perfect." u"absolutely terrible! They messed up my order and then the manager and other employees came to the table to yell at me even though I told them it was fine. The passive aggressive behavior lasted all meal and they made us super uncomfortable. I would not suggest anyone eat here I've never been yelled during a meal by staff before." u"This is a good Spanish restaurant right by Time Square. The paella was very good and had a diverse choice of ingredients. The staff is also courteous and helpful. While this is not the best Spanish paella I've ever had it stands on its own and the tapas are actually quite good." u'Food is delicious! The hospitality is very enjoyable! They are friendly quick and attentive!']
159.Green Apple Gourmet Deli,[u"With all of the deli/bodega options around I was pleasantly surprised by the buffet offerings. \xa0Multiple types of salads pastas meats... you could even get full avocados. \xa0WHAT? \xa0I didn't but they were gorgeous.I wouldn't plan a huge meal here though. \xa0Four stars because the advertised upstairs eating area is not glamorous. \xa0I sat at a small table next to a nail salon so I enjoyed getting high off of acrylic along with my eggplant salad. \xa0But for a grab-and-go place this was top notch.Thanks Green Apple!" u'This is a super busy lunch spot. I was attending a conference a few blocks away from Green Apple. When we broke for lunch this deli came very highly recommended from the conference staff.When I arrived there was a line out the door for custom salads. I did a quick walk around the deli to get the lay of the land. They had a sandwich area sushi asian food grill and the typical large salad bar in the middle. I decided to go with the custom salad bar as the long line assured me the food would be fresh.I got a salad with a small vegetable soup. The prices were pretty typical for the area around $13 for lunch - soup salad and a drink. I sat in the upstairs seating area which was reasonably clean. There was a nail salon housed in the same area so you did have some residual smell but nothing crazy noxious. The food was good and tasted fresh. I would come back if I am ever back in the area.' u"Many options - didn't try any by-the-pound options but did stop in for a quick sandwhichI bought the honey mustard chicken hot sandwich that had lettuce mozzarella and roasted red peppers - delicious - good quality chicken and very generous amount - large enough for two of you like to split and get a salad or something and was $9.99 - they had a lot of other hot items that looks delicious as they were preparing themI sat in the upstairs and it was comfortable and nice to be able to sit for awhile and eat away from large crowds (and I was here at noon - the deli was hopping but there were petty of seats upstairs" u"Walked by here a few times. It is expensive but your paying cause it's in Time Square so it is understandable. Earlier in the afternoon we got a sandwich and was not fresh tasted old and tough. We avoided many of the hot foods on display cause it looked like it had been there for a while. Later in the evening we walked past and got a gelato. $6/cup so that was reasonable but like some of the scam artist that seem to plague time square they even do it with gelato! The gelato was in the cup looked full  until you paid and walked out. After you eat two of the tiny scoops ( size of a thumbnail) you realize that more than a third of the cup underneath is completely empty! They cover the top of the cup and span the gelato across the top to make it look full. Right after I walked out I walked right back in and showed the young lady who served it(see pic). She replied that's how they do it and there's nothing wrong with this( see pic). So that's when I realized this is just how it's done when you have such a large fluid population that walks by constantly. They were being cheap and it's intentional. It's sad that you even have to report things like this. Not a reputable place. Just a FYI" u"Green Apple Deli doesn't get enough credit among some of the \xa0giant commercial chains found in Times Square. It is a small deli with some great sandwiches and very reasonable prices. The hours are open later than some of the other eateries in the area which is convenient for late night meals. They have a wide variety of foods such as a salad bar and Chinese. However they also offer subs and sandwiches made to order. We chose the latter option. The veggie burger was amazing as was the husbands Philly cheesesteak. After a long day of walking and sightseeing takeout from here was the way to go." u"Awesome variety to choose from. \xa0It's a little overwhelming walking in but the guys behind the counter are great at walking you through your options and if you're lucky the customers will be equally as helpful." u'Clean place free wifi and good fresh food--great deli salads premade sandwiches made-to-order salads Thai Asian fresh fruit. Seating area upstairs. Good value!' u'Nice place to grab something! Buffet seems to be fresh...delicious but not a place to go every day...' u'Love this place! There are SO many options so there\'s something for everyone!:) I loved the food bar and everything looked so fresh and delicious! Super fresh fruit! Yummy ripe mangos blueberries strawberries blackberries pineapple etc! I also tried the salmon sweet potatoes RIBS! Everything was SO delicious!There\'s also a salad station smoothies stir fry and sandwich station. AND gelato! Beer wine too lol. SO many options! And I loved all the little snacks they had like healthy nut bars kale chips etc. Such a pleasant surprise from a "deli" with tons of healthy and fresh options which I loved! Not the typical boring deli with old not so yummy food which is what I usually expect from a deli:)Can\'t wait to go back! Definitely an awesome choice for lunch! There\'s also a seating area upstairs!! (Someone wrote in a review that there\'s no seating.. But that\'s incorrect hehe)Five stars!:)' u'This is a small quick & easy deli on Broadway. Food is fresh & tastes great service is outstanding and the crew behind the counter is super friendly. Even the locals are uber outgoing. \xa0So if you want something other than the typical tourist trap with mediocre food and horrible service this is the place to go. \xa0All of this for less than 1/2 the price of other restaurants on the strip. \xa0Pretty much my breakfast quite possibly lunch and definitely late night snack choice for the rest of my stay in town.' u"If you're looking for a decent grill menu at good prices this is your place. They also have a hot food buffet which didn't look as good. They had lots of choices and reasonable prices especially considering its proximity to Times Square." u"After having worked performed auditioned interviewed seen shows escorted tourists and putzed around in this area for the past decade I've become pretty versed in the deli and by-the-pound options available in the Theater District as well as in most Midtown West and East neighborhoods. \xa0GAGD is leaps and bounds above the majority of their competitors in these - and most other - Manhattan neighborhoods I've frequented.Very clean store. \xa0Very well lit (bright without being offensive). \xa0Nice window display. \xa0Large amount of seating upstairs (conveniently by a mani/pedi spa!). \xa0Friendly staff. \xa0Really reasonable pricing for sandwiches. \xa0And a cold/hot bar that while priced slightly above the majority of their competitors is the freshest and tastiest I've ever found. \xa0They freshly restock it all day long and into evening rush hour. \xa0And all but one thing I tried was awesome (as in I would have been happy ordering an entire entree of any of these dishes). \xa0Everything was fresh flavored well perfectly seasoned not overly salted composed well and just delish. \xa0No more dried hours old food to grab between jobs/appointments. \xa0GAGD has you covered be it salads and vegetables a buffet of entrees sandwiches fresh salads parfaits and desserts! \xa0They even have free WiFi (though I wasn't able to spy any power outlets....).Don't let the word 'Gourmet' scare you away. \xa0You'll pay the exact same - if not less - here as nearly any other quick eats spot but you'll actually get your money's worth here!" u"The biggest plus about this place is its offering of a wide selection of foods. They have everything from gelato to Chinese takeout to Whole Foods style healthy stuff. All the food is weighed just like at Whole Foods and it's pretty expensive for the quantity you get. There's seating upstairs next to this hair salon place kinda ghetto. It would have gotten a better rating from me but I had to cut down 2 stars because 1) the place is dirty (e.g. flies flying around) and 2) the rice I got was inedible (tasted like it had been sitting there for 2 days left to sour)The rest of the veggies/meat/quinoa I got tasted fine though. And it's nice to find a self service spot in the middle of Times Square beside halal. Another plus it's open late at night." u"My wife and I were in Manhattan over the memorial day weekend. We didn't want to go out for dinner so I ordered from this place. Delivery was very quick and the food was nothing short of excellent. We ordered a 12 inch honey turkey sub a tomato basil Italian wrap (which was fully stuffed) and a Reuben sandwich. It was all very good. The delivery guy was very polite as well. \xa0Total for three large sandwiches delivery and a 20% tip was $35.00. I didn't think that was a bad price at all." u"One of my fave lunch spots Great food lots of great options & very clean. Pricey but it's located in Times Square." u'Top notch! \xa0Great food made fresh with lots of care. \xa0You can get any deli sandwich fixed anyway you like it. \xa0There are also hot sandwiches and hot food. \xa0Yummy! \xa0I got a bacon cheeseburger and it was great! \xa0In a rush and on the go in Time Square you must stop here.' u"One of the best places I have while being in town for work. They have a wide variety of food options that are not only tasty but prices well. I pretty much always have the build your own salad. You get to pick you base like mixed greens spinach romaine then add a protein grilled chicken salmon shrimp then you pick 6 other ingredients have it chopped or not then a dressing. \xa0You also get a cup of soup and a slice of bread all for under 10.00There really isn't seating so don't plan on earring there. This is a great quick lunch in and out" u"Super-clean deli with good food options. I was looking for a deli with some pre-made breakfast options as in buffet tables. I first went to the Crown Deli which is a couple of blocks away from Green Apple and its scrambled eggs and sausage were rather disgusting and I am pretty sure the cashier overcharged me as suggested by many reviewers of Crown. And then thanks to Yelp reviewers I was directed to Green Apple and boy am I glad I found it.Why pre-made breakfast? I need to get to work fairly early each morning and sometimes it's frustrating to wait in line to order breakfast and then wait for it to be made and depending on the place the whole process could take up to 15 minutes. PLUS when you order scrambled eggs at the grill what they usually end up giving you is not scrambled eggs but basically a dry partly charred plain egg omelette which is NOT what I want.I could tell that Green Apple actually give a sh*t to try to make their scrambled eggs as good as possible and it's as close to hotel-style scrambled eggs as it can get at a deli. They also have sausage links hash browns and pre-made breakfast sandwiches at the buffet. It being buffet the items may not be as piping hot as made-to-order but I was happy with the taste and I will definitely be coming back." u'Great breakfast food. \xa0I had burrito with chicken and eggs. \xa0 Kids had the buffet $9.25 /lb and it was very good. \xa0Got out for $40 for family of five - pretty good for NYC. \xa0 All of the good and coffee was delicious.' u"I had a fresh made pastrami and corned beef sandwich and a slice of the cherry cheesecake. The sandwich was excellent. Piled high with quality lean meat the slaw was fresh and crispy and the bread held up well. The cheesecake was tasty. Creamy and heavy the way it's supposed to be. The cherry topping was a little too gelatinous but still good. They have a large selection of pre-made hot food as well as a ton of different salads. You can choose to eat really healthy or really naughty or somewhere in between. (Naughty was a good way to go but everything looked delicious)Service was friendly and fast. The place is wicked clean."]
205.Sammy’s House of BBQ,[u'The best BBQ in the city. In fact the best BBQ north of the Mason Dixon line and maybe even a little south of that. The brisket will melt in your mouth. The green tea ice tea is out of this world. \xa0You have to try the Mac and Cheese and corn bread.' u"Stopped in before going to see Something Rotten great atmosphere and awesome food.I ordered the slider trio and it was delicious. I really love how many sauce choices they have. The food came out quick and service was good.My only two issues were that there seemed to be no air conditioning and today was around 108* with the heat index. I know this wouldn't be an issue all year.My bigger issue was that there was no happy hour. If you are in time square and are already going to have medium-priced good happy hour should be given. I really wasn't happy about that.I would come back again for another pulled pork sandwich but not for the drinks." u"Sammy.s marks the return of Chef Lou from Wildwoood Bbq of yore. The theatre district locale ensures hefty tourist concentration especially across the street from Phantom of the Opera.The food is good and it's well priced. Ate:Salmon & two sides for &23The sauce line- up here is comparable to Pig Beach in Brooklyn & the Tennessee mustard is oh so good. My salmon was tasty slightly over cooked but tasty nonetheless. I went with asparagus and collards with turkey both good & it came with an unremarkable piece of cornbread. Otherwise a good value for the locale!" u"Found this place through Yelp after seeing a huge Friday night wait at the popular Dallas BBQ nearby.Got the sampler bbq platter to share with all 5 meats: \xa0brisket chicken sausage ribs and pulled pork. \xa0Sides: cornbread mac & cheese beans.*Sharing fee=$7.Favorites: \xa0brisket pulled pork.Oh that brisket was melt in your mouth. \xa0Pulled pork was also so tender and really digged the flavor here.The rest of the meats are hard to score because I feel bbq is subjective... We were a little disappointment in the ribs but not because they were bad they are just done here differently than what we prefer. \xa0They had a great crisp surface dry rubbed not super fatty.Chicken was good the sauce on top was a nice compliment. \xa0Though I think any more time in the bbq and it would have been dry.Objectively disappointing: Cornbread was not warm!? \xa0Could have been great love cornbread with real kernals throughout but it was actually a bit cold in the center...bummer.Beans were good/average. \xa0The mac & cheese did not fulfill my expectations through yelp--the sauce was a little gritty from the cheese they use. \xa0Just fine nothing awesome.I'd still recc this place is you want good bbq around this area without the waits of the popular places like Dallas BBQ. \xa0 Atmopshere was also nicer than those places as well as the staff. We got an immediate seat though that may change soon with word of mouth." u"I haven't had many burgers in my lifetime but this one was amazing. I ordered a turkey burger and swapped the regular fries for sweet potato fries. When my food arrived I thoguht they messed up my order because I made tater tots. Little did I know the sweet potato fries came in the form of a tater tot. It was delicious. The turkey was moist and you could apply sauce if you like because they provide a lot on the table. As for the service a lovely lady (I wish I asked for her name) who recently moved to New York from Florida served my table. She was extremely friendly and constantly check on us. I'm glad she was our waitress. If you're are looking for a burger this is an excellent restaurant." u"Very good Bbq - I went 3 times over 8 days!!! DEVIN my server and Maurice are great!! I'm a hill country fan so now I know why I was drawn to them...Big Lou Elrose!! The pitmaster worked there as well!! My new fav midtown Bbq spot! The moist brisket and Mac and cheese is heavenly" u'I stopped in for a take-out lunch and ordered a Hot Link Hoagie. The owner Maurice was just amazingly friendly and service was stellar. \xa0The dish -- a spicy smoked sausage with onion rings and BBQ sauce was scrumptious. \xa0The dish came with coleslaw and fries (GREAT!) as well as a pickle. \xa0Everything was super delicious and I even have enough left to munch on later. \xa0I know that this will be a regular spot for me and I will surely be taking home dinner on late nights. \xa0GREAT FIND!!' u'Service is ok Had the pulled brisket sandwich it was just ok. Meat was a bit tough and stringy fries were pretty good. \xa0 Would I come again? Sure just to make sure my first time was a fluke with the sandwich.' u"Sammy's food is delicious!! Definitely try the sliders...they are fantastic! The bar will be open soon. The food is delicious...better than Guy Fieri's the prices are reasonable (unlike Guy's) there are 3 levels and you can't beat the location...right across from the Majestic Theater and heart of the Theater District!" u'Really good ribs and Mac and cheese. \xa0Convenient to Broadway shows. \xa0I have brought my daughter here a couple of times. \xa0I have actually shared a meal with my daughter since the meals are good sized portions.' u'5 stars for great atmosphere food service & drinks! Will be back! ~all the way from Oklahoma!' u"I wish I could rate it as high as some of the other reviewers and our experience was good. Let's start with the positive- a nice modern environment and atmosphere with country music piped in and a friendly wait staff. The food was good but not great. I'm a tourist and can't comment on how it compares to other BBQ restaurants in the City but if that's the best the City has to offer I'll stick with pizza. \xa0And the prices are a little on the high side." u"Chicken sliders are so GREASY you couldn't eat them. \xa0Found a large bone in my BBQ sandwich and was told by manager...that's normal in a boston butt. \xa0I'm like...I don't think so the size of the bone should have been caught when pulling the meat. \xa0He didn't care and walked away. \xa0I felt bad for the waitress who took away over 1/2 our food and kept apologizing for it. \xa0The only decent thing was the fried pickles (even if most lost their crust)." u'A welcome addition to the theatre district restaurant scene. Great BBQ and amazing pork nachos.']
185.Nizza,[u"My group ended up at Nizza for a late night bite after seeing a Broadway show. We wanted something in between a pizza shop and fine dining. Realizing that we could have a casual sit-down pizza experience with a server we decided to check it out. We were told we'd only have twenty minutes. A twenty-minute wait seemed a little crazy considering there were tables open. We then realized that the kitchen was closing around midnight. \xa0As an aside they were listed in our playbill as being open until 2:00am. They were either open until 2:00am for drinks or were false advertising. No gripes from here on out. The focaccia bread was piping hot and beaming with rosemary. The olive oil dip had a touch of cream in it as well and was really tasty. Our group split the Charred Cauliflower pizza. It was a white pie with sundried tomatoes caramelized onions spinach roasted garlic pepper flakes and asiago. While they were looking to close-up shop this pizza was clearly made fresh for us. I personally enjoyed the combo of toppings but probably most enjoyed the crust. It was so light and flakey with a slight airy doughy-ness to it. Despite the restaurant's time-table we certainly didn't feel rushed. I'd come back and give their menu and wine list some more time and exploration." u"I came here on a recommendation from the concierge at my hotel. It looks fairly nice although the decor is a little out dated. I was surprised how empty the restaurant was at 6pm on a Friday night. That was my first clue that something was wrong but it couldn't be that bad. Right? My wife ordered a passion mule a non alcoholic Moscow mule with passion fruit. It sounds delicious. It was just fresh passion fruit juice (I love passion fruit but if you've ever had it fresh you know it has a very strong bite ) and ginger beer. It was barely drinkable. The bread was decent. I ordered the special some kind of pasta dish and my wife got the lasagna. Her dish was definitely better than mine although I think a hungry man frozen lasagna meal would have been even better. As we left (hungry) we commented that we would have been far better off eating at the Olive Garden. Who goes to New York to eat at a chain? And we can't stand the Olive Garden. Maybe the pizza was better. I don't know nor would I care to find out. On the positive side the service was good the water was cold and we didn't get sick. So I guess it wasn't the worst restaurant I've ever ate at." u'Nothing too special. (Waitress was pretty good tho) Salad was the only memorable item. Chocolate tiramisu would be a "double thumbs down" from me.Pizza was "blah"' u"Our group came here for a 6:00 reservation before going to see a show very accommodating for our gluten free aunt that was with us. Both the gluten free and regular focaccia was delicious!! I got the Cacio e Pepe and it was so so good. Highly recommend for a bite before a show/or if you're are gluten free." u"Blech.My boyfriend and I stopped here late one night after seeing a show at the Broadway Theater. It was 11 pm and knowing everywhere would soon be closed we let a super quick Yelp search for gluten free lead us here. The gluten free focaccia bread was by far the highlight of the meal (and the only reason we didn't leave feeling completely ripped off and led astray). I wouldn't come here again just to have it but if I could buy some of the focaccia to take home I definitely would. However the oil & cheese dip it was served with was just weird. The main food was just awful -- borderline inedible. After reading such wonderful things about the soccas I decided to be adventurous and try it. I like chick peas and I like most gluten free food attempts. This however was a sad soggy pile of wanna-be dough. The massive pile of arugula on top (why...?) couldn't even mask the gross taste. It set me back on being adventurous with food at least a few months. Seriously I felt nauseous afterwards! If you're looking for some gluten free food post-theater keep on walking. Even for the regular food I have my doubts with this place's high-end pricing. And if you absolutely MUST come here please oh please don't order a socca." u"Oh wow. I normally order from here on seamless. I love their gluten free food it is maybe the best I've had so I was excited to come here in person. I walked in and it was just awful. The ambience is horrendous. I asked to be seated in the corner to attempt to avoid the horrible noise and of course they wouldn't accommodate me even though the restaurant was empty and it was not long before close. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack in there it was so awful so I walked out. They should really stay on seamless until they close instead ending two hours early. Or they should create a pleasant establishment where I'd love to come order a full meal and a few glasses of wine! As it is now ugh! :(" u"Went here for my fianc\xe9's birthday from a recommendation from a friend who'd been here previously and we were not at all disappointed! Firstly service was top-notch! Totally forgot to ask the server for his name but deserves huge kudos. Super attentive. The food was amazing. We had the focaccete as an appetizer fianc\xe9 had the pansoti and I had the Sunday pasta. Both meals to die for and a very generous portion without being at all overwhelming. Had the tortofo dessert which was delicious. Along with our food we had a cocktail; fianc\xe9 had a peach Bellini martini and I had a prosecco mimosa. Both beyond delicious.Great location on 9th avenue and right near the theater district. Had a very extensive brunch menu for any fans of brunch. Would totally recommend to anyone looking for a nice Italian restaurant." u"Nizza is ok. \xa0That's the essence of it. \xa0They're fine but nothing special. \xa0I got the pizza wife got the sunday pasta. \xa0Both were reasonably tasty but neither was good enough to really wow me and make me want to come back. \xa0Mostly just kinda average. There are a few other Italian places in Hell's Kitchen I'd recommend before Nizza." u'I\'m usually not picky when it comes to pizza but this was hands down the best pizza I ever had. Even my mom who worked at a pizzeria in Austria in the past said it was "beyond excellent". The restaurant had great ambiance Ryan the server was funny and personable and the service was quick. We\'d definitely be back! This was our first dinner in NYC--what a good first impression!' u"Stumbled across this Italian restaurant in the middle of our walk through Hell's Kitchen. It appears that Hell's Kitchen is notorious for all different types of restaurants and genres of food and based off the overall average of stars in this area (4-5) I figured we couldn't go wrong! It looked like a cool elitist place from across the street so we peeped at the menu and decided to give it a try. The hostess was nice and told us reservations were not necessary and that a table would be opening within 5-10 min. We sat ourselves at the bar for a quick drink the bartender remained smile less while he asked what we wanted. I chose the Rosa Della Casa and instead of nodding or saying 'No problem' he said 'So the house wine?' I don't know why but it skeeved me that he had to point out that it was the house like it wasn't expensive enough? Anyways got our wine the hostess came and told us our table was ready and the bartender took forever and a day to close out our tab I'm sure he had much cooler people to serve then us. We were seated at a nice candle lit two top table with my seat facing towards the outside. Our waitress came over and greeted us with \xa0'Is tap water OK to start?' lol again can't you just say 'Would you like some water?' icksnay the tap part. Their were several meat entrees pastas antipasti etc to choose from our waitress recommended a few options one of them being lasagna which we got and I was really craving Gnocchi so when I saw it on the menu it was a definite for me to order. Herb focaccia bread with olive oil and ricotta were brought prior to our entrees (we had to ask for this) and although it was good it wasn't even warm when we got it. The lasagna and Gnocchi were out relatively quick. Unfortunately the lasagna was a total miss and my friend mentioned it tasted no better then stouffers. It would have been better with a dash of pepper and fresh parmigiano had it been offered (we saw other tables being offered fresh crushed red pepper and cheese). The Gnocchi was much better then the lasagna but it's only savior was the melted cheese on top. The Gnocchi and tomato cream itself was almost as bland as the bartender.All around I think this place has/or had potential but the staff has got to cheer up and the chef needs to utilize his spices." u'The most authentic Italian restaurant in USA! This is definitely one of the best restaurants in NYC to me. I recommend gnocchi.' u'We came in at 11pm were seated right away.I enjoyed the food here had tuna and Caesar salads for starters and margarita pizza and salmon for entrees. The food was very good done to perfection.Server was nice and attentive. Our dessert was cheesecake and it was delicious.The cocktails were good as well.I had peach Bellini Martini and kamikaze bartender definitely knows his stuff. Overall great experience with a loved one.' u'I am so surprised at the recent (negative) reviews. I ate here with a friend in May after a long long walk from the 9/11 memorial. We went on the recommendation of a local and were very happy with our pizza - reminded us of the pizza we had in Rome the year before. Also our server was very pleasant - attentive the food came quickly and he checked back with us without making us feel rushed. I will go again when I am next in NYC.' u'Away from Times Square Nizza surprised me with good bread appetizer and atmosphere. Lost 1 star on the gnocchi that lacked taste and texture.Service and cappuccino were great.Melissa was awesome and the outside seating is a plus. I recommend.' u'Ordered Pepperoni pizza eggplant and tomatoes and mozzarella appetizer. All food items were average at best. The bread served at the table was dry and hard. The tomatoes and mozzarella were flavorless. Service was kind and responsive but food quality was not unique or special.' u'The service was great (other than not telling me about the socca pizza and how far it is from pizza...) The gluten-free "pizza" is something called socca which if I\'d known what that was I\'d have tried something else. While the toppings sauce and cheese were pretty tasty the socca was nothing like what I\'d call pizza and it fell apart as I tried to eat it. Absolutely foul flavor. Who thought pizza crust on a chickpea pancake was a good idea?' u"Did not like the gluten free crust at all! It's more like a chickpea cracker. The location is nice and I'm sure they have some good dishes but their gf pizza is a no go." u"Nice Italian restaurant with a famous socca dish specialty of Nice France made from cheek pea flour.We went with my friends after a brunch that mostly consisted in drinking and not eating.The food was acceptable. I got a cheese pizza which was rather small and did not taste any special. My wife got a salad that was ok. Also we tried a plate of socca and it was not nearly as good as the original but it gives a good idea of what you would deal with in the south of France.I would give a 4 star but the waiter left a nice oil stain on my short when he cleaned up the table and barely said sorry so it's one star less for that." u"Um yes. This place is amazing and yes you have to try everything on the menu. I've had delivery from here twice and if their delivery is this good I can't imagine how great it is in store. I've had the meatballs lamb sausage pizza and the quattro formaggio and everything was as amazing as it sounds. They have a delicious crust that you can taste and see that it's made with love. They clearly use quality toppings and really put the time into making each pizza perfect. The meatballs were great only with there was more than TWO in the order. Food came quick and was still hot and delicious. You haven't had pizza until you've been to Nizza. Definitely give it a shot I'll for sure be back for more." u'2 of us went to dinner. Ordered appetizer pizza and drinks. The appetizer came out before any water or drinks were served. While waiting for liquids the manager approached with an attitude and said "you didn\'t order your calamari or why aren\'t you eating it?" but didn\'t notice our empty water glasses that hadn\'t been filled since arrival. We replied that we were waiting for something to drink before starting to eat. After that he would check by with a smart little attitude and sneer each time. Was a strange and unwelcome experience. There are many other great restaurants in the big city.']
87.Hummus Kitchen,[u"Food: pretty good overall. I've sampled a few things salads and the hummus dishes(favorites are sirloin and vegetable hummus) are all very good! Entrees are a hit or miss. Not a fan of tilapia morocco fish it was overcooked. The chicken kabob and Schwarma are good however. I'd recommend trying a few dishes to see what you like. Service: nice waiters though quite slow serviceAmbience: really nice. It's a very down to earth place. the only downfall is the location which is undergoing construction.Also the place is glatt kosher(meat) so there is no dairy whatsoever.. there are tons of meat dishes obviously as well as vegan vegetable based (and dairy free) dishes. Also open on Saturdays a huge plus for those who are kosher but not sabbath observant.Definitely recommend!" u"The food here is very good I have to say that first off the bat. The sirloin hummus is really great. \xa0It does seem a little smaller for their portion size and the shakshuka was not very filling when I had it and it was still reasonably expensive. The service was really slow (especially on a weekday lunch) and the waitress wasn't the most helpful. Its decent if you are in the area but not worth a special trip." u'Came for dinner. Tasty but smallish portions on the "mazze" dishes menu. I don\'t believe their "3 for $16" mazze deal would fill you up even with the bread but again well seasoned. The hummus entrees and the sandwiches (which doesn\'t come with a side) are probably your best deal. I would have gone for a falafel sandwich but shockingly they ran out. Come early I guess? Cute interior. Waitress was a bit scattered and had to be asked "where is X?" several times.' u"So let me start by saying the shawarma wrap I got was amazing with the exception of hidden onions which I didn't realize it came with. If you order just the sandwich that's literally all you get. I also tried their mint lemonade which went perfectly with my meal and for a steamy day in the summer. Most of the options are standard to the Mediterranean cuisine - falafel hummus and pita babaganush shawarma lamb couscous. Prices seemed reasonable enough with the exception of $5 for the mint lemonade. I'm obsessed with Mediterranean food so Hummus Kitchen already had my support from the start but the service was less than desirable. My waitress seems less than thrilled to be serving me or anyone else and it was challenging to hunt her down. I said to her directly I wanted my check once my food came out but it took another 10 minutes after I was done eating to get her attention. The seating is a bit tricky since the restaurant is narrow and the tables in the front get this incredible sun which isn't so pleasant and can be blinding. So I'd take this at your own risk or if you can ask to be seated toward the back. Would come back if in the area to try the hummus and pita but not likely for anything else." u'I ordered the Shawarma hummus lunch special ($15) and Mezze mediterranean chopped salad ($6) through Seamless and have to say I had a very underwhelming lunch experience. The prices and food portions are what was the most disappointing thing. I get it this is Manhattan and a lot of things can be needlessly marked up Etc. but this felt excessively stingy. The chopped salad was a disappointment since there was practically no mint or olive oil found in it just a small case of chopped cucumber and tomato. The shawarma lunch "special" wasn\'t too bad the chicken and hummus tasted pretty good but it came with a single pita :( you think for a $15 lunch they\'d throw in an extra pita!In conclusion I\'ll only ever order from here if I\'m super desperate and craving middle eastern food The area has a bunch of options so hopefully the need doesn\'t arise again. Hummus kitchen - start showing some love to your customers so they can love you back!' u"With a list of more than 10 restaurants and a limited amount of time my group knew that Hummus Kitchen was a must-do during our NYC visit. Knowing it was tiny my friend called ahead and tried to get a reservation. She was told that there's a large party coming in and we basically shouldn't bother. We decided to swing by anyways and were seated momentarily on arrival. During our hour visit we never once saw a large group. I guess they were saving the space for later in the evening....If our server rolled his eyes at us one more time I think his eyes would get stuck in the back of his head. Lack of attentiveness snatching things from our table and quickly dropping things off were amongst his other attributes. Our visit took place during Passover. I wish we were informed ahead of time that the restaurant was observing and having all customers do so as well. I'm Jewish I get the concept. As a non-observing Jew I felt highly shortchanged that my delicious mezze dishes were served with something to the likes of cardboard. At that rate I could have just stayed home with my own box of matzah and supermarket hummus. The food itself was good. We had the hummus (free as part of the Yelp check-in offer) babaganush cauliflower and falafel. The portions seemed a little small. We split everything four ways so perhaps we should have gotten another item or two. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table. It was good but a little too heavy on the fruit. As a not-too-frequent visitor to NYC there are so many places I can try that Hummus Kitchen blew it for me and will not be getting a second chance." u"If you're getting sick of the same old American brunch Hummus Kitchen is an awesome alternative. The $16 weekend brunch deal includes tea or coffee a sampler of Mediterranean appetizers and a brunch entree of your choice. If you check in on yelp there's also a free cider. Since the restaurant was out of cider for the day the waiter offered me a free sangria instead (even better!). If you add an extra $7 you get unlimited sangria or mimosa. For the price this is definitely awesome deal. I really liked my hummus shakshuka entree. The blend of hummus tomatoes cumin and over easy egg dipped with pita bread was such a comforting way to start a Saturday morning. All the complimentary appetizers were really delicious as well. My favorites were the roasted cauliflower and salmon. Our pita bread basket was constantly refilled with warm fresh bread. Needless to say I was very happily full from the meal even more happy to know that most of what I stuffed myself with was made up of veggies or chickpeas. How often is brunch so healthy?Like most of the restaurants in this area the space is quite intimate. The tables are ideal for parties of 2-4 but definitely uncomfortable for bigger parties. For some reason the restaurants in Hell's Kitchen are never very crowded for brunch (guess everyone is flocking to the villages for brunch) thus all the more compelling to come here during prime brunch time." u'We are pretty fond of Middle Eastern cuisine and we were pretty curious about a place called Hummus Kitchen.With 3 different locations in Manhattan - Hell\'s Kitchen Upper East Side and Murray Hill - we decided to visit the one in Hell\'s Kitchen this time...and we simply loved it.It\'s a small place with around 20 tables a small fa\xe7ade a very welcoming environment with gorgeous brick walls (yes we\'re into brick walls lol) and an extremely outgoing and polite staff.We got there around 12:30pm and in no time the place was full plus the delicious smell from the kitchen started subtly invading the entire place - don\'t worry it doesn\'t stick to your clothes and hair....!We tried several different Vegan dishes (see picture) like:- Super-Healthy Salad - Quinoa apricot cranberry walnuts and charred beets with fresh lemon juice and mint dressing- Charred Beets - Tahini silan organic mixed greens & walnuts- The Falafel - Falafel balls made from greens and chickpea served with tahini cured cabbage and grilled onion- Cauliflower - With tahini grilled red onion and thyme- The Hummus Kitchen - Platter divided by four types of hummus: chickpea chicken (we substituted for the vegetarian hummus) tahini and plainDesserts were aaaamazing:- Malabi - Mediterranean flan topped with coconut pistachio & grenadine- The Kitchen Kadif - Halva parfait on shredded filo dough topped with halva & silanDo try them! We\'re definitely going back to try the Loco Morocco a chocolate mousse cake with coconut and whipped cream over dark chocolate sauce! Important: All pictures must be credited "Behind the Scenes NYC by Brussels Vegan".' u'As of late I have been on a huge hummus kick. \xa0Seeing that this venue offers a free hummus when you check it was a great find. \xa0While the hummus was good I found that their baba ganoush was quite tasty. \xa0Nice smoky flavor and a garlic bite. \xa0Each dip served with warm pitas.' u'***Great and quick service*** I came here with a friend to have a dinner meal. I ordered a shakshuka and it was delicious; my only issue was that it was a bit watery from the tomato. However I enjoyed the intimate setting and the wonderful customer service.' u'I am not really into Mediterranean food especially vegetarian dishes but I was so impressed by this place that I am planning to go back. hummus- so smooth and creamy. I would have liked it to be more garlicky.babaganush- THE BEST I have ever had. It was so garlicky filled with other flavors with the right amount of "char" flavoring.falafel- I normally do not like falafel but I love how this was made. It was super crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. I really liked the outside mix/coating they used which made it a bit harder and crunchier on the outside.Moroccan Fish- It was OK. It was lacking a complexity of flavors. It was just fish with a tomato sauce.kebab wrap- The ground lamb/beef kebabs were also very good. They were well seasoned and very well cookedthat it was super moist.' u"Hummus Kitchen was a recommendation from our Big Bus tour guide. Our meal was wonderful. The salmon platter was amazing as well as the red chicken. A great restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. We made a reservation through Yelp." u'The humus was perfect we ordered the large sampler plater which was large \xa0enough to share (2 adults + 2 kids).We also had the vegi soup and chicken kabob over rice. Overall the food was good but the chicken was charged and dry (white meat). I would have preferred dark meat but did not think to ask when I ordered.The brunch menu looked very good (huge) with lots of options... Maybe next time.RBL' u"Simply delicious. Lightest smoothest hummus I've ever had. I had the dish with portobello mushrooms. Yum!" u'Hummus was good but the Red Chicken was \xa0undercooked sent it back and got charged for one third of the Chicken.' u"I think we shocked the waitress how much we ordered for two people. We decided to have a quick pre-theater dinner. Appetizer:1) Trio: we chose the cauliflower baba ghanoush and hummus. The cauliflower was surprisingly my favorite one. The other two were just average. Oddly enough the chicken hummus entree's hummus was much better. Entrees:1) Falafel wrap2) Chicken hummus3) Chicken shawarma wrap- The chicken hummus was the best out of all the dishes we ordered. Not to say the others weren't good. I would recommend at least ordering cauliflower as an appetizer and the chicken hummus for your entree. The food here is very reasonably priced as well. The brought out the food quickly (granted there weren't too many customers when we were there) and were good about refilling our water (one of my husband's dining pet peeve is slow water refills)." u'Came here craving for sm Hummus The place is very tiny but very original welcoming and warm. Nice playlist ( jazzy style) and love the floor with sm original Sirianish style tile. Our waiter was Jarvis. Very cool dude professional attentive ( he kept on pouring us water) which I found very nice... On top of that always a smile on. Good job Jarvis \xa0Food was good.We ordered the chickpea hummus platter babanush ( pretty good) cauliflower with tahini sauce ( sorry to say the dish lacked of flavour it was pretty bland I had better) sm nice felafel and a very good good beet salad with caramelized walnuts. Overall it was a good experience. I would def come back and the price is great. 29.40$ taxes included' u'Great restaurant in Hell\'s Kitchen with many vegetarian options-- mostly vegetarian and vegan with some meat available. Really good & smooth hummus here! Tons of different types of hummus- plain chickpea tahini mushroom etc (basically the same base hummus with different toppings). The hummus platter is great for sharing. I love that they serve warm fluffy whole wheat pita as an option!! Much better than plain white pita. The whole wheat pita was very soft and yummy. They don\'t serve a lot at a time so you have to keep asking if you want more. There is a variety of salads entrees and a "tapas-like" options where you can pick three different items. Really good selection of clearly-market vegan options! I had the falafel cauliflower (AMAZING) and tomato/cucumber salad. I would recommend hummus kitchen for a healthy plant-based meal. The restaurant \xa0was nice with a good atmosphere. Not overly crowded either. Service and prices both acceptable.' u'Nice place .. Small and cozy .. Simple menu .. Falafel wrap is ok ... Hot sauce is not that hot ... But charred beet and chickpea hummus are excellent .. Servers need to be more attentive... Overall worth a visit ..' u'Hummus Kitchen is a fun restaurant in a good area closet to Times Square. When we first arrived we immediately got seated however it took quite some time for a waitress to come take our order. Once the waitress came she was very unprofessional and said ughhhh finally I can take yalls order - what do you want. Very cold and unfriendly. She complained that they were busy and just got a rush when we arrived. When we had questions about the food she was very short with her answers and talked to us as if we were dumb even though the menu did not state answers to our questions. She was very nice and allowed one of the people in my group try the lemonade bc he asked if it was good; however it took her what seemed forever to act silly bring the drink. Getting our glasses even filled with water was quite the hassle for her as well. When the food finally arrived it was very good. I got the shawarma wrap and I really enjoyed it. Very good favor and a good size. Not overly large but still filling. Everyone in my party enjoyed their foodSo overall excellent food but unfortunately the service was so poor I have to dock them 2 stars for that. If there were half stars I would give 3.5 :)']
153.Gleason’s Tavern,[u'What a nice find with such a live friendly staff!!I definitely recommend stopping in and cooling off on a hot day touring the city. I found this beauty getting to a broadway show early with some friends and deciding to grab a bite and some drinks at this amazing spot. This the by far the nicest tavern I have been to in the time square area. Salad was fresh and cocktails were so delicious. Nice menu with plenty of options. If you are in the Times Sq area please do you self a favor and stop in!' u"Went for breakfast today the place had maybe 10 people there at most. \xa0Server had no personality she took our order of 2 omelets. It took 1 hour for 2 omelets! Won't be going back" u'Service food ambience... Perfect trifecta!Must try the flat breads... Simply delicious' u'Went here because we saw reviews were pretty high. Very disappointed overall. Service was painfully slow. Took over 30 minutes to get two omelets to us (only four other tables in the place). Food was bland. Server had no personality. Would never return.' u'The calamari was great our first visit here! great bar can be hit or miss for crowds depends on what day of the week! super convenient to our hotel! Trying the food menu tonight!!' u'I waited 10 minutes at a table and finally just went up to the bar and ordered drinks and a chicken sandwich. After 35 minutes I asked a waitress to check our order and she said it was almost done. After 10 more minutes I asked another staff member and he went back to check. A few minutes later he came back and said there was a mix-up and food would be out in a few minutes. 5 minutes later it came out so it took nearly an hour from the time I ordered. Then I had to go back to the bar for napkins because they never gave us any. The chicken sandwich was pretty good but entire experience was bad because of the wait so I would not go back.' u'Breakfast here is delicious but it ends by 11:30 so no sleeping in if you want to partake in this deliciousness! \xa0The Avocado Toast was DELICIOUS! \xa0I got the Feta Toasted Nuts (walnuts) and Sunny Side Up Egg. \xa0Perfect portion of breakfast. \xa0Service was slow but nice. \xa0Definitely worth the price.' u'Stopped in randomly for an iced tea before a meeting nearby and met the owner Mark and the bartender. We were greeted and treated as if we had a three course meal. Will definitely stop in again when in the neighborhood Ps. My first Yelp review' u'Great bar. It is a hidden gem. Amazing food and drinks and the bartenders are so nice. Not to mention the drinks are on the next level. I recommend it to the average New Yorker and any tourist. This is the place to be.' u'Great bar scene. The burger is absolutely amazing!! Some great beers on tap. This place is a winner. One of my favorite new spots in midtown']
